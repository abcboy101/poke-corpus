And, and! Uh…\cWe just saw a\nreally gorgeous\r<wtext_ram StringBuffer4>.\cBut I was on the\nphone, so it got\caway. It made us\nreally angry!
And, and! Um…\cWe beat a wild\n<wtext_ram StringBuffer4> with\cjust one hit a\nlittle while ago.\cWe felt sorry for\nit, though.
And, and…\nI just battled and\rbeat <wtext_ram StringBuffer4>!\cI've raised my\nPOKéMON properly!
And, you know?\nWe just failed to\cbeat <wtext_ram StringBuffer4> by\na tiny margin.\cI'm guessing my\nPOKéMON's levels\caren't high enough\nyet…
And, you know?\cNow we can KO\n<wtext_ram StringBuffer4> easily.\cI should challenge\nthe GOLDENROD GYM.
Anyway, we'll chat\nagain!
Anyway…\cIf you're short on\nmoney, take down\rmy number.\cI'll call you when\nthere's a sale.

But after seeing\nhow you battle, I\cwant to see how\nI'll fare.\cHow about it? Let\nme take you on.
But get this, a\nwild <wtext_ram StringBuffer4>\cjust barely eluded\nus.\cI wanted to FLY\nafter it…
But it failed!
But no PP is left\nfor the move!
But nothing\nhappened.
But the PACK is\nfull…
But we don't know\neverything about\rPOKéMON yet.\cThere are still\nmany mysteries to\rsolve.\cThat's why I study\nPOKéMON every day.
But you can't use\nFLY without this\rcity's GYM BADGE.\cIf you beat the\nGYM LEADER here,\rcome see me.\cI'll have a nice\ngift for you.

But… Is it a\nPOKéMON EGG?\cIf it is, it is a\ngreat discovery!
But… Please, I\nneed your help!

By challenging a\ntough trainer like\cyou, I think I can\nget better too.\cSo how about it?\cWould you give me\nyour phone number?
By experiencing\ntough battles, you\rgain power.
By giving POKéMON\nitems to hold, I\cbet trainers will\ndevelop new battle\rtechniques.
By having FOG-\nBADGE, POKéMON up\cto L50 will obey\nyou.\cAlso, POKéMON that\nknow SURF will be\cable to use that\nmove anytime.\cI want you to have\nthis too.
By the way, I'm a\nHIKER, so I often\cgo to mountains\nand caves.\cI occasionally see\nrare POKéMON.\cI could call you\nthe next time I\rsee one.\cFeel like swapping\nphone numbers?
By the way, a wild\n<wtext_ram StringBuffer4> escaped\ron me yesterday.\cA computational\nerror on my part…
By the way, we\nknocked out a wild\c<wtext_ram StringBuffer4> just\nthe other day.\cStudying up in\nadvance worked!
By the way, you're\na POKéMANIAC…\cI can tell.\nYes, you are.\cBut your knowledge\nis shallow still!\cDo you know BILL?\nHe's an incredible\cPOKéMANIAC.\nI revere him.\cI'll teach you all\nI know about BILL,\cso leave me your\nphone number.
By the way, you've\nsaved up ¥<wtext_ram StringBuffer3>.\cDo you want to\nkeep on saving?
By the way, you've\nsaved up ¥<wtext_ram StringBuffer3>.\cWant to start\nsaving again?
By using a TM, a\nPOKéMON will\cinstantly learn a\nnew move.\cThink before you\nact--a TM can be\rused only once.\cTM31 contains\nMUD-SLAP.\cIt reduces the\nenemy's accuracy\cwhile it causes\ndamage.\cIn other words, it\nis both defensive\rand offensive.

What's this?\cWhat is this\nPOKéMON?\cIt looks like the\nstrange writing on\cthe walls of the\nRUINS.\cIf those drawings\nare really POKé-\rMON, there should\rbe many more.\cI know! Let me up-\ngrade your POKé-\rDEX. Follow me.
Hm? This is no\nplace for playing.
Hm? Who are you?\c<PLAYER>, eh? You\nwant me to make\rsome BALLS?\cSorry, but that'll\nhave to wait.\cDo you know TEAM\nROCKET? Ah, don't\cworry. I'll tell\nyou anyhow.\cTEAM ROCKET's an\nevil gang that\cuses POKéMON for\ntheir dirty work.\cThey're supposed\nto have disbanded\rthree years ago.\cAnyway, they're at\nthe WELL, cutting\coff SLOWPOKETAILS\nfor sale!\cSo I'm going to\ngo give them a\rlesson in pain!\cHang on, SLOWPOKE!\nOld KURT is on his\rway!
Hm? You know BILL?\nHe's my grandson.\cHe's in JOHTO. He\ndoes something\cwith PCs, so I'm\nhouse-sitting.
Hm? You're good,\naren't you?
Hm? Your POKéMON\nparty is full.
Hm?\cThat's not the\nPOKéMON that I was\rtold about.
Hmmm. This is\ndisappointing.
Hmmmm… \nThis isn't right.
Hmmm… I don't know\nwhat to do…
Is there any\ndifference between\rthese lines?
Hmmm… This is a\nstrange place.
Hmmm…\cAll grand plans\ncome with snags.
Hm… Good to see\nyou here.\cNo need to explain\nwhy you came.\cCLAIR sent you\nhere, didn't she?\cThat girl is a\nhandful…\cI am sorry, but I\nmust test you.\cNot to worry, you\nare to answer only\ra few questions.\cReady?
Hm… Good to see\nyou here.\cYour arrival is\nmost fortunate.\cI have something\nfor you.\cTake this DRATINI\nas proof that I\chave recognized\nyour worth.
Hm… I see you met\n<text_ram wSeerNickname> here:\r<text_ram wSeerCaughtLocation>!
Hm… I see…\cYou care deeply\nfor POKéMON.\cVery commendable.\cThat conviction is\nwhat is important!\c<PLAYER>, don't\nlose that belief.\cIt will see you\nthrough at the\rPOKéMON LEAGUE.
Hm… You've got\nmany GYM BADGES.

Hm… <wtext_ram StringBuffer1>…\nThat's a fairly\rdecent name.\cBut, how about a\nslightly better\rnickname?\cWant me to give it\na better name?
Hold it right\nthere!
Hold it there,\nkiddo!\cThe toll is ¥1000\nto go through.
Hold it!\cI saw you, so I\ntailed you.\cI don't need you\nunderfoot while I\ctake care of TEAM\nROCKET.\c…Wait a second.\nYou beat me be-\rfore, didn't you?\cThat was just a\nfluke.\cBut I repay my\ndebts!
Hold it.\cYou're going to\ntake the POKéMON\cLEAGUE challenge\nnow?\cThat's not going\nto happen.\cMy super-well-\ntrained POKéMON\care going to pound\nyou.\c<PLAYER>!\nI challenge you!
Hold it.\c…Are you going to\ntake the POKéMON\rLEAGUE challenge?\c…Don't make me\nlaugh.\cYou're so much\nweaker than I am.\cI'm not like I was\nbefore.\cI now have the\nbest and strongest\cPOKéMON with me.\nI'm invincible!\c<PLAYER>!\nI challenge you!
Holds up to 9,999\ngame coins.
Hoo, you showed me\nhow tough you are.\cAs always, that\nwas one heck of a\rgreat battle!
How annoying!
How are things?\nLand the big one?
How are you?\cWhat are you\ndoing?\cWhere are you?\cHow many BADGES do\nyou have now?\cHow much money\nhave you saved?\cHow's your mom?\cHave you got lots\nof POKéMON?\cIs it going to be\nsunny tomorrow?\cArrgh, there's so\nmuch I want to\cchat about! This\nis going nowhere!
How are your\nPOKéMON doing?\cMy POKéMON are a\nbit too energetic.\c<wtext_ram StringBuffer4>,\nespecially.\cEvery time it\nspots a trainer,\rit has to battle.\cIt gets to be a\nbit much for me!
How are your\nPOKéMON doing?\cMy POKéMON have\ntoo much energy to\cburn. It gets to\nbe a problem.\cOf all my POKéMON,\n<wtext_ram StringBuffer4> is the\rhardest to handle.\cWorking with it is\nexhausting.
How are your\nPOKéMON doing?\cMy <wtext_ram StringBuffer4> is\nso curious, it's a\cproblem. Maybe\nit's like me…
How are your\nPOKéMON doing?\cMy <wtext_ram StringBuffer4>'s\ndoing as great as\rever.\cLet's keep at it\nand become POKéMON\rCHAMPS!
How are your\nPOKéMON doing?\cMy <wtext_ram StringBuffer4>'s\nraring to go, just\rlike always.\cIt's the only one\nI have. I'm going\cto become a great\ntrainer with it!
How are your\nPOKéMON doing?\cYou know PROF.OAK,\nso of course your\rPOKéMON are fine!\cMy POKéMON are\ndoing well too.\cBut then, I am\ntrying to become a\cPOKéMON professor,\nso that shouldn't\rbe a big surprise.
How come the guy\nnext to me catches\rgood POKéMON?
How come you're\nnot here yet?\c<text_ram wStringBuffer5> is\nwhere I am.\cPlease get here as\nsoon as you can!
How could I lose?
How could this be?\cOur dreams have\ncome to naught.\cI wasn't up to the\ntask after all.\cLike GIOVANNI did\nbefore me, I will\cdisband TEAM\nROCKET here today.\cFarewell.
How could you do\nthis to me?
How could you?
How did you get\nthis far?\cI guess it can't\nbe helped. I'll\rdispose of you.
How disappointing…\cCome back if you\nwant to listen.
How do I go about\nbecoming ladylike\rlike ERIKA?
How do you like\nS.S.AQUA's ride?\cShe practically\nskates across the\rwaves.
How do you raise\nyour POKéMON?\cI do all sorts\nof things, like\cleaving them in\nDAY-CARE and\ctoughening them up\nwith items.
How does the MAG-\nNET TRAIN work?
How does this\nstyle look to you?
How is that\n<wtext_ram StringBuffer2> I\rtraded you doing?\cYour <text_ram wMonOrItemNameBuffer>'s\nso cute!
How is your POKé-\nDEX coming?\cLet's see…
How is your\nPIKACHU doing?\cLet's get together\nand brag about our\rPIKACHU!
How many RODS do\nyou have?\cDifferent RODS\ncatch different\rPOKéMON.
How many do you\nwant to deposit?
How many do you\nwant to withdraw?
How many minutes?
How many should I\nmake?
How many?
How much do you\nwant to save?
How much do you\nwant to take?
How should I beat\nyou? I'm tormented\cby those thoughts\nall the time…
How the heck do\nyou go up?\cI want to visit\nthe sick POKéMON,\cbut I can't get up\nthere…
How unlucky!\nI lost!
How will you dis-\ntinguish our real\rLEADER?
How would you like\nto have this\ctasty, nutritious\nSLOWPOKETAIL?\cFor you right now,\njust ¥1,000,000!\cYou'll want this!
How'd you like my\nMOOMOO MILK?\cIt's my pride and\njoy, there.\cGive it to POKéMON\nto restore HP!\cI'll give it to ya\nfer just ¥500.
How's your trip\ncoming along?\cI can't complain\nabout my fishing!
However hard we\nbattle, the TOWER\rwill stand strong.
How… How dare you\nmock royalty!
Huh, what? Your\nphone's full.
Huh? BERRIES?\cSorry, I haven't\nfound any yet.\cI'll call you if I\nfind any. Will you\rplease wait?
Huh? Back already?\nYour <wtext_ram StringBuffer1>\cneeds a little\nmore time with us.\cIf you want your\nPOKéMON back, it\rwill cost ¥100.
Huh? How did this\nhappen?
Huh? I shouldn't\nhave lost that…
Huh? Is that thing\na POKéDEX? Have\ryou met PROF.OAK?\cHuh? You have? \nThat's way cool!\cI have a dream of\nbecoming a POKéMON\cresearcher like\nPROF.OAK.\cMay I please have\nyour phone number?\cWe should chat\nabout PROF.OAK.\cI'm sure it will\nbe loads of fun!
Huh? My own eyes\ndeceived me?
Huh? Sorry, wrong\nnumber!
Huh? That's not\nenough money.
Huh? That's not\n<wtext_ram StringBuffer1>. \rWhat a letdown…
Huh? The POKéMON I\njust got is hold-\ring something!
Huh? You don't\nhave anywhere to\cput this. Better\ncome back for it.
Huh? You want me\nto show you how to\rcatch POKéMON?
Huh? Your phone\nlist is full.
Huh? Your phone\nlist's full.\cA POKéMANIAC has\nto be more tidy!
Huh? <wtext_ram StringBuffer2>\nstopped evolving!
Huh?\c
Humph!\cWhat are you doing\nfalling into a\chole? Some genius\nyou are!\cServes you right!
Humph. Are you\nhappy you won?
Humph. That was a\nwaste of time.
Humph. This is my\nreal power, wimp.\cI'll make TEAM\nROCKET history.\cAnd I'm going to\ngrind that LANCE\runder my heels.
Hurts foes when\nthey switch out.
Hyuck-hyuck-hyuck!\nI remember you!\cYou got me good\nat our hideout!
Hyuck-hyuck-hyuck!\nSo, that's how?
Hyuck-hyuck-hyuck!\nThat was a blast!\rI'll remember you!
Hyuck-hyuck-hyuck!\nYou're good!
Hyuck-hyuck-hyuck!\cThe password to\nthe boss's room…\cUh…, I think it is\nRATICATE TAIL.
Hyuck-hyuck-hyuck!\cYou're challenging\nme to a battle?\cHah! You're nuts,\nbut you have guts!\cI like that!\cIf you can beat\nme, I'll tell you\ca password to the\nboss's room!
I always dance\nwith my POKéMON.\cOf course, I also\ntrain them.
This machine looks\nthe same as the\rothers.
I am BRUNO of the\nELITE FOUR.\cI always train to\nthe extreme be-\rcause I believe in\rour potential.\cThat is how we\nbecame strong.\cCan you withstand\nour power?\cHm? I see no fear\nin you. You look\cdetermined. Per-\nfect for battle!\cReady, <PLAYER>?\nYou will bow down\cto our overwhelm-\ning power!\cHoo hah!
I am CLAIR.\cThe world's best\ndragon master.\cI can hold my own\nagainst even the\cPOKéMON LEAGUE's\nELITE FOUR.\cDo you still want\nto take me on?\c…Fine.\nLet's do it!\cAs a GYM LEADER,\nI will use my full\cpower against any\nopponent!
I am KAREN of the\nELITE FOUR.\cYou're <PLAYER>?\nHow amusing.\cI love dark-type\nPOKéMON.\cI find their wild,\ntough image to be\cso appealing. And\nthey're so strong.\cThink you can take\nthem? Just try to\rentertain me.\cLet's go.
I am meditating…
I am sorry.\cCLAIR, our GYM\nLEADER, entered\cthe DRAGON'S DEN\nbehind the GYM.\cI have no idea\nwhen our LEADER\rwill return.
I am the FISHING\nDUDE, the elder of\rthe FISHING BROS.\cHave you met the\nFISHING GURU at\rLAKE OF RAGE?\cHe dreams about\nseeing the world's\rgreatest MAGIKARP.\cIf you don't mind,\ncould you show him\cany MAGIKARP you\ncatch?\cWho knows, you may\ncatch the MAGIKARP\rof his dreams.
I apologize, but I\ndon't have time to\cchat while I am in\ntraining!\cI'll have time to\nchat tomorrow!\cYiiihah!
I battled the\ntrainers on the\rroad.\cMy POKéMON lost.\nThey're a mess! I\cmust take them to\na POKéMON CENTER.
I believe you are\nbeing tested.\cFree your mind\nfrom uncertainty,\rand advance.
I best go do my\nmilkin'.
I bet you can't\nbeat me!
I bet your POKéMON\nare a lot stronger\rthan before.
I blew it!
I bought it with\nyour money. Sorry!
I bought some PINK\nBOWS at GOLDENROD\cDEPT.STORE for my\nCLEFAIRY.\cI got too many, so\nI'll give you one!\cCome collect it on\n<text_ram wStringBuffer5>.
I call my PIDGEY\nSTRAWBERRY!
I came all the way\nhere to conduct my\rPOKéMON research.\cLet me demonstrate\nmy findings in a\rreal battle!
I came over here\nwhen I got word\cthat GOLDENROD's\nPOKéMON CENTER has\cnew machines that\nno one's ever seen\rbefore.\cBut it looks like\nthey're still busy\cwith all their\npreparations…
I came through the\ntunnel, but I\cstill have plenty\nof energy left.
I came to OLIVINE\nby ship to see the\csights and soak up\nthe atmosphere.\cBeing a port, it\nfeels so different\rfrom a big city.
I came to explore\nMT.MORTAR, but I\cgot separated from\nmy partner…\cDid you run into a\ntrainer who uses a\cSEADRA that knows\nWATERFALL?
I came to explore\nROCK TUNNEL.
I came too far\nout. I'd better\rphone home!
I came with my mom\nto visit POKéMON\rgraves…
I can beat you in\npride, but…
I can count on my\nPOKéMON more than\rmy boyfriend.
I can do only one\nhaircut a day.\cSorry, but I'm all\ndone for today.
I can do so much\nwith my POKéMON--\rit's super-fun!
I can dream, but I\ncan't ever fly…
I can keep dancing\nbecause there are\cpeople who enjoy\nwhat I do.\cMy POKéMON keep my\nspirits up too.
I can pay you\n¥<text_decimal hMoneyTemp, 3, 6>.\cIs that OK?
I can run like the\nwind!
I can see it…\cEverything to see\nabout you…
I can teach your\nPOKéMON amazing\cmoves if you'd\nlike.\cShould I teach a\nnew move?
I can tell you're\na good trainer by\rlooking at you.\cI'm good at POKé-\nMON, and I can see\rthat you are too.
I can't allow a\nnameless trainer\rpast me!\cCLAIR would be\nlivid if I did!
I can't decide\nwhich POKéMON I\cshould use this TM\non…
I can't manage a\nsmile either…
I can't move any-\nmore…
I caught a bunch\nof POKéMON. Let me\rbattle with you!
I check GOLDENROD\nDEPT.STORE every\cday, so I know\nwhen there's a\rsale.
I collect POKéMON.\nDo you have\r<wtext_ram StringBuffer1>?\cWant to trade it\nfor my <wtext_ram StringBuffer2>?
I could beat you\nat swimming…
I could call you\nwhen I see some\rrare POKéMON.\cFeel like swapping\nphone numbers?
I couldn't find\nthe KARATE KING in\rJOHTO.\cHe's supposed to\nbe training in a\rcave somewhere.
I couldn't foresee\nyour power…
COIN CASE? I threw\nit away in the\rUNDERGROUND.
I did my best but\ncame up short.\cNo excuses--I\nadmit I lost.
I did my best.\nI have no regrets.
I didn't study\nenough, I guess.
I didn't want to\nlose…
I do only one\nhaircut a day. I'm\rdone for today.
I don't believe\nit! I was beaten!
I don't believe\nit! You're going\rto regret this!
I don't care if\nyou're lost.\cYou show up here,\nyou're nothing but\ra victim!
I don't care that\nI lost, really!
I don't care that\nPOKéMON are hurt\rby our experiment.
I don't even know\nwhere the traps\rare planted.\cYou'll just have\nto collect your\rcourage and walk.
I don't have any\nPOKéMON left…
I don't mind\nlosing.
I enjoyed that\nbout. I would like\rto see you again.
I failed in my\nduties…\cI'll be docked pay\nfor this…
I fancied up my\n<wtext_ram StringBuffer4> and\cmade it even cuter\nthan before!
I feel like just\nflying away now.
I feel lousy over\nlosing!\cDarn it! I hate\nuseless POKéMON!
I feel so content,\nfishing while lis-\rtening to some\rtunes on my radio.
I feel so much\nlighter in water.
I fish until I\ncan't anymore.\cI also battle\nuntil I drop.\cThat's my\nrelationship\rwith my POKéMON.
I flamed out!
I forgot to do my\nhomework!
I fought fair and\nsquare with honor.\cI don't regret\nthis at all.
I fought hard but\nI'm too weak.
I found a good\nPOKéMON in DARK\rCAVE.\cI'm going to raise\nit to take on\rFALKNER.\cHe's the leader of\nVIOLET CITY's GYM.
I found a pretty\ncoin here.\cSomeone must have\nlost it…
I found a useful\nitem shopping, so
I found all kinds\nof BERRIES. If you\cwant, I'll share\nsome with you.\cI'll be waiting on\n<text_ram wStringBuffer5>.
I found some good\nPOKéMON in the\rgrass!\cI think they'll do\nit for me!
I found that when\nI was caring for\csomeone's POKéMON\nbefore.\cBut the trainer\ndidn't want the\cEGG, so I'd kept\nit around.
I get anxious if I\ndon't check out\rthe latest NEWS!
I get it. You can\nhear JOHTO's radio\ron the FAST SHIP.
I get it…
I get the feeling\nthat it really\rtrusts you.
I get the other\nguy's POKéDEX\rsticker if I win.
I get to help\nGrandpa now!\cWe'll make good\nBALLS for you, so\rplease wait!
I give up! You're\nthe winner!
I give up.\nYou don't have to\clook. Just forget\nabout it!
I give!
I got booted out\nof the GAME COR-\rNER.\cI was trying to\ncheat using my\rPOKéMON…
I got chased from\nmy post by these\rthugs in black.\cThey left this\nbehind.\cIt makes me uncom-\nfortable. Could\ryou take it away?
I got disposed of…
I got my ABRA at\nthe GAME CORNER.\cNow it's my best\npartner.
I got quite a\nshock at the GYM.\cThere were all\nthese girls who\rlooked identical.
I got shattered!
I got wiped out on\nthe last mission\rby a kid too.\cWhen we were ab-\nducting POKéMON,\cthis kid with long\nred hair and mean-\clooking eyes just\ncreamed me…
I guess I can't\nwin if I don't get\rserious.
I guess I have to\ndo things fair and\rsquare…
I guess I should\nteach them better\rmoves…
I guess I'm not\ngood enough yet…
I guess fire is\nweak on the sea.\cIt doesn't matter?\nReally?
I guess it's im-\npossible to swim\call the way to\nJOHTO.
I guess you can't\nbecome the CHAMP\cunless you go all\nover the place and\cbattle all kinds\nof people.\cThe CHAMPION from\nPALLET traveled to\call the cities and\ntowns in KANTO.
I guess you'll be\nfinished with your\cconquest of KANTO\nGYMS soon.\cLet me know if\nyou get all eight\rBADGES.
I had lots of fun\nplaying!
I had no time to\nshow off PIKACHU…
I had some time,\nso I called you.\cSo anyway, how are\nyour POKéMON?\cMe, I take my\n<wtext_ram StringBuffer4> to the\cPOKéMON CENTER in\nVIOLET every day,\cso it's doing just\nfantastic!\cI'm friends with\nthe receptionist!
I had you fooled…
I hadn't seen that\nPOKéMON before…
I happened to come\nacross a wild\rSNUBBULL recently.\cMy SNUBBULL, I\nassure you, was\cfar cuter than the\nwild one.
I happened to see\na wild MARILL the\cother day.\nOr so I thought.\cA closer look\nshowed it was\c<wtext_ram StringBuffer4>. I was\nquite miffed.
I hate having to\nhang up on you!\cCall you later!
I hate the weak.\cPOKéMON, trainers.\nIt doesn't matter\rwho or what.\cI'm going to be\nstrong and wipe\rout the weak.\cThat goes for TEAM\nROCKET too.\cThey act big and\ntough in a group.\cBut get them\nalone, and they're\rweak.\cI hate them all.\cYou stay out of my\nway. A weakling\clike you is only a\ndistraction.
I hate to admit\nit, but you win.
I have a feeling\nthat I can win.\cLet's see if I'm\nright!
I have to do my\nhomework, so can\cyou come get your\ngift right away?\cI'm waiting on\n<text_ram wStringBuffer5>!
I have to take so\nmany tests, I\cdon't have much\ntime for POKéMON.\cSo when I do get\nto play, I really\rconcentrate.
I have to watch\nout for blemishes\rcaused by the sun.
I have to win\nthese battles…
I haven't gotten\nwhat I promised\ryou yet.\cI'll call you as\nsoon as I get it,\cso could you wait\na little longer?
I haven't had any\nluck seeing rare\rPOKéMON lately…\cBut I know they're\nout there!
I haven't picked\nup anything yet.\cI'll call you if I\nfind something.
I haven't seen you\naround before.\cSo you think you\nare pretty tough?
I hear TEAM ROCKET\ngot back together\cin JOHTO but fell\napart right away.\cI didn't know any-\nthing about that.
I hear rumors\nabout you all over\rthe place.\cIt just makes me\nsigh, <PLAY_G>.\cHow did you get so\nstrong?\cGo for the world\nchampionship now!\cI'll always be\ncheering you on!
I hear there's a\nPOKéMON that looks\rjust like a tree.\cYou can reveal its\nidentity using a\rSILPHSCOPE 2.
I hear POKéMON are\nrampaging at the\cLAKE OF RAGE. I'd\nlike to see that.
I heard CLEFAIRY\nappear at MT.MOON.\cBut where could\nthey be?
I heard a rumor\nabout OLIVINE\rLIGHTHOUSE.\cThe POKéMON that\nserves as the\cbeacon fell ill.\nSounds like they\rare in trouble.
I heard a POKéMON\nwas stolen here…\cI was just getting\nsome information\rfrom PROF.ELM.\cApparently, it was\na young male with\rlong, red hair…\cWhat?\cYou battled a\ntrainer like that?\cDid you happen to\nget his name?
I heard about a\ncraftsman who\cmakes custom BALLS\nin the JOHTO town\cof AZALEA. I wish\nI had some.
I heard about a\ncute POKéMON that\rhas six tails.\cI would love to\nhug a cute POKéMON\rlike that.
I heard roars from\ndeep inside the\rISLANDS.
I heard that a red\nGYARADOS appeared\rat the LAKE.\cThat's odd, since\neven ordinary\cGYARADOS are rare\nin that lake…
I heard that some\nshady character is\rskulking about.\cI won't stand for\nit if he turns out\rto be a thief.
I heard that there\nare many items on\cthe ground in\nVIRIDIAN FOREST.
I heard that the\nGYM in CINNABAR is\rgone.\cI wonder what be-\ncame of BLAINE,\rthe GYM LEADER.
I heard that you\ncan only see it if\cyou have a SILVER\nWING.\cIt must have the\nsame scent as the\rcreature.
I heard that\nyou're hot!
I heard this lake\nwas made by ram-\rpaging GYARADOS.\cI wonder if there\nis any connection\cto their mass out-\nbreak now?
I heard, I heard!\cYou got a MAGNET\nTRAIN PASS!\cWhen I saw you\ndeparting on the\cship, I felt sad\nthat I wouldn't be\cable to see you\nfor a while.\cBut since you have\nthat PASS, you can\czip back anytime!\nThat's reassuring!\cWhat? You can FLY\nback anytime?\cWhat do you mean\nby FLY?
I heard, I heard,\nI heard!\cAbout your heroic\nliberation of the\cRADIO TOWER! You\nrock so hard!
I heard, I heard,\nI heard!\cYou smashed TEAM\nROCKET's hideout!\cYou're like a\nmovie hero, even!\cBut um… What was\nTEAM ROCKET?
I hope you learn\nand grow from your\rjourney.
I just battled a\nfriend in CIANWOOD\rover a link.\cIf you connect a\nMOBILE ADAPTER,\cyou can link with\na friend far away.
I just beat a wild\n<wtext_ram StringBuffer4>.\cI told my kid, but\nhe scoffed that he\ccould do the same\nthing easily.\cBoy, has he gotten\ncocky…
I just can't find\na way to win!\cKeep it up!\cOh, and take this\n--it's the gift\cyou couldn't take\nwhen we last met.
I just finished\nadjustments on my\rTIME CAPSULE.\cYou know that\nPOKéMON can be\rtraded, right?\cMy TIME CAPSULE\nwas developed to\cenable trades with\nthe past.\cBut you can't send\nanything that\cdidn't exist in\nthe past.\cIf you did, the PC\nin the past would\rhave a breakdown.\cSo you have to\nremove anything\cthat wasn't around\nin the past.\cPut simply, no\nsending new moves\cor new POKéMON in\nthe TIME CAPSULE.\cDon't you worry.\nI'm done with the\radjustments.\cTomorrow, TIME\nCAPSULES will be\crunning at all\nPOKéMON CENTERS.\cI have to hurry on\nback to GOLDENROD\rand see my folks.\cBuh-bye!
I just got back to\nOLIVINE.\cSo how about a\nPOKéMON battle?
I just got care-\nless, that's all!
I just got my\nPOKéMON back from\rDAY-CARE.\cLet's see how much\nstronger it got!
I just got word\nfrom CERULEAN.\cIt appears that a\nshady character\chas been loitering\naround.
I just happened to\ncome through ROCK\cTUNNEL. There was\nsome commotion at\rthe POWER PLANT.
I just lost, so\nI'm trying to find\rmore POKéMON.\cWait! You look\nweak! Come on,\rlet's battle!
These machines\nseem different\cfrom the ones at\nCELADON CITY!
I just recently\nbecame a trainer.\cMy son encouraged\nme to do it.\cI'm impressed by\nthe selection of\rconvenient items.
I just saw some\nrare <wtext_ram StringBuffer1> in\r<wtext_ram StringBuffer2>.\cI'll call you if I\nsee another rare\rPOKéMON, OK?
I just want to see\nthe MAGNET TRAIN…
I keep catching\nthe same POKéMON…\cMaybe a battle\nwill turn things\raround for me.
I keep losing in\nbattles, and my\cPOKéMON end up\nfainting…\cMaybe that's why\nmy POKéMON don't\rlike me much…
I knew I'd lose…
I knew I'd win.\nI'm so great!
I knew it.\cI knew you'd get\nto see the POKéMON\cof rainbow colors,\n<PLAYER>.\cIt happened just\nas I envisioned.\cMy research isn't\nbad, I might say.\cI'm going to keep\nstudying POKéMON\cto become a famous\nPOKéMANIAC!
I know PRYCE's\nsecret.
I know a couple\nwho run a POKéMON\rDAY-CARE service.\cThey gave me that\nEGG.\cI was intrigued,\nso I sent mail to\rPROF.ELM.\cFor POKéMON evolu-\ntion, PROF.ELM is\rthe authority.
I know my short-\ncomings now.\cThanks for showing\nme!
I know my POKéMON\ntype alignments.\cBut I only use one\ntype of POKéMON.
I know something\ngood!\cMOOMOO FARM's milk\nis famous for its\rflavor.
I know there's a\nnew BIKE SHOP, but\cI can't find it\nanywhere.
I know this might\nsurprise you, but\cwould you like to\nbattle?\cI'll be waiting\nwith CLEFAIRY on\r<text_ram wStringBuffer5>.
I know what my\nweaknesses are.
I know! I'd like\nyou to have this!
I like cute POKé-\nMON better than\rstrong POKéMON.\cBut I have strong\nand cute POKéMON!
I like snoozing\nwith the radio on…\r…Zzzz…
I like the POKéMON\nLullaby they play\ron the radio.
I like thinking\nhere.
I listened to the\nradio while I was\rat the RUINS.\cI heard a strange\nbroadcast there.
I live down here.\cYou can, too, if\nyou'd like.\cThere's plenty of\nroom, you see.
I look cool, but\nI'm weak, so I'm\rnot really cool.\cI have to train\nharder…
I lose my passion\nfor work if some-\rone's watching.\cCome on, kid,\nscoot!
I lost again…\nGee, you're tough!\cOh yeah, I almost\nforgot that I had\rto give you this.\cUse it to get even\ntougher, OK?\cI'm going to get\ntougher too.
I lost at the\nmachines.
I lost on my home\nfield…
I lost that one!
I lost the battle,\nbut my POKéMON win\cthe prize for\nbeing most lovely.
I lost the in-\nstruction booklet\rfor the POKéGEAR.\cCome back again in\na while.
I lost to a train-\ner named <RIVAL>.\cHe was really\nstrong, but…\cIt was as if he\nabsolutely had to\rwin at any cost.\cI felt sorry for\nhis POKéMON.
I lost to some\nkid…?
I lost too…
I lost! \nI'm speechless!
I lost, but I feel\nbetter anyway.
I lost. That's\npretty sad…
I lost?\cI don't believe\nit. There must be\rsome mistake…
I lost…
I lost…\nDarn…
I lost…\cPlease forgive me,\nGIOVANNI!
I love CLEFAIRY,\nbut I could never\ccatch one. So I'm\nmaking do with a\cPOKé DOLL that I\nfound.
I love MARY, from\nPOKéMON TALK.\cI only know what\nshe sounds like,\rthough.
I love being\nsurrounded by tall\rbuildings!\cIsn't it true that\nGOLDENROD POKéMON\cCENTER was made\nmuch, much bigger?\cThat is so neat!\nI wish we had a\cplace like that in\nKANTO…
I love dressing up\nmy CLEFAIRY!
I love my\nbeautiful self!\cWho cares about\nPOKéMON?
I love showing off\nthe POKéMON that\cI've raised.\nDon't you?\cI'm going to get\ninto a bunch of\cbattles, and show\noff my POKéMON!
I love the way\nCLEFAIRY waggles\cits finger when\nit's trying to use\cMETRONOME.\nIt's so adorable!
I love POKéMON!\cThat's why I\nstarted--and why\cI'll keep on col-\nlecting POKéMON!
I met my MEOWTH at\nnight, right here\ron ROUTE 39.\cI'm not sure why,\nbut it seems to\clike it when I\ntrain here.\cIt seems to become\nfriendlier by\ctraining here than\nanywhere else.
I might be an ex-\npert angler, but\cI stink as a POKé-\nMON trainer…
I might be bad at\nswimming, but I\rlove the sea.
I misread you!
I mistook you for\nsomeone else…
I must go to the\nPOKéMON SALON and\rfix them up nice!
I must say, your\nPOKéMON are quite\rcute, too.
I must train\nharder to become\rthe mightiest!
I must've imagined\nthat.\cThere seems to be\nno one here…
I obsess over how\nto beat you.
I picked up a good\nlittle thing at\rthe water's edge.\cLike I promised,\nit's yours.\cI'll be waiting on\n<text_ram wStringBuffer5>.
I picked up some-\nthing nice today.\cI want you to have\nit, so I called!\cYou will come for\nit, won't you?\c<text_ram wStringBuffer5> is\nwhere I am.
I plan to fish off\nVERMILION's pier.
I plan to take a\nlunch break, so\ccome see me then!\nAyiiiyah!
I plan to train in\nCIANWOOD CITY to\cteach my POKéMON\nhow to FLY.
I played too much!
I put a different\nflower in my bar-\rrette every month.
I put the clock\nback one hour.
I raise POKéMON\ntoo!\cWill you battle\nwith me?
I ran into a wild\n<wtext_ram StringBuffer4>…\cI was trying to\ncatch it, but it\ctook off faster\nthan I thought it\cwould. It was a\nbit disappointing.
I ran out of POKé\nBALLS while I was\rcatching POKéMON.\cI should've bought\nsome more…
I read that there\nare four of those\rstone panels.
I received a\nfemale HOPPIP, but\rits named STANLEY!\cThat's my dad's\nname!
I recently began\nobserving wild\r<wtext_ram StringBuffer4>.\cI've been learning\nall sorts of new\cthings through my\nobservations.\cI wish I could\nbecome a POKéMON\cresearcher like\nPROF.OAK soon.
I reckon yer\nPACK's full.
I rested up over\nmy lunch break.\cNow it's time to\nresume training!\cOooryaah!
I roam far and\nwide in search of\rPOKéMON.\cAre you looking\nfor POKéMON too?\cThen you're my\ncollecting rival!
I saw a wiggly\ntree up ahead!\cIf you touch it,\nit squirms and\rdances! Cool!
I saw these weird,\nslow POKéMON on\rCYCLING ROAD.
I saw this shady\nguy go off toward\rCERULEAN's CAPE.
I saw, I heard!\cYou beat MORTY of\nECRUTEAK GYM!\cTh-that's just\nincredible!\cI actually went to\nthe GYM's entrance\cto cheer you on.\nDid you know that?\cBut everyone was\nfloating, and\cthere were ghosts\nall over! So I\cchickened out and\ntook off for home…
I saw, I saw!\cI saw you go into\nthe DRAGON'S DEN!\cI'm certain you\npassed! Aww, no\cneed to be modest!\nYou can't fail!
I saw, I saw!\cYou waking up\nSNORLAX!\cI was watching you\nfrom afar, so I\ccouldn't tell what\nyou did exactly.\cDid you play a\nflute to wake it?\cWow! That's like\nmagic!
I saw, I saw,\nI saw!\cYou striding onto\na ship, <PLAY_G>!\cI can't get over\nhow good you look\cwith the sea as\nyour backdrop!
I see all.\nI know all…\cCertainly, I know\nof your POKéMON!
I see you're rais-\ning your POKéMON\rwith care.\cThe bond you build\nwill save you in\rtough situations.
I see. So you can\nbattle that way.
I see…\cWe, the WISE TRIO,\nhave been given \cthe responsibility\nof protecting the\clegendary POKéMON.\nWe are to allow\cpassage only to\nthose people who\cpossess the power\nand soul of truth.\cPlease, do go on\nand enter the TIN\rTOWER ahead.\cSUICUNE will put\nyou to the test.
I see…\cYour journey has\ntaken you to far-\raway places.\cAnd you have wit-\nnessed much more\rthan I.\cI envy you for\nthat…
I set the clock\nforward by one\rhour.
I shall win!
I should compile\nand announce my\rstudy findings.\cI might even be-\ncome famous like\rPROF.ELM.
I should go to\nROCK TUNNEL to get\rmyself an ONIX.
I should have used\nmy MOON STONE…
I should train\nagain at the GYM\rin VIOLET CITY.
I shouldn't have\nbeen bragging\rabout my skiing…
I snagged an item\nwhile fishing.\cCome pick it up on\n<text_ram wStringBuffer5>.
I spent the spring\nwith my POKéMON.\cThen summer, fall\nand winter…\cThen spring came\nagain. We have\clived together\nfor a long time.
I stop my POKéMON\nfrom evolving too\rearly.\cI make them learn\ncertain moves be-\rfore I let them\revolve.
I subjected you to\neverything I could\rmuster.\cBut my efforts\nfailed. I must\rhone my skills.\cGo on to the next\nroom, and put your\rabilities to test!
I take my GUARD\njob seriously.\cHey! You have a\nPOKéDEX.\cOK. You can go\nthrough.
I take quantity\nover quality!\cI'm happy when I'm\nfull!
I take walks in\nthe PARK, but I\cnever go into the\ngrass.\cTrainers always\nwant to battle…
I taught BLIZZARD\nto my POKéMON.\cIt was hard to get\nenough coins for\cit, but it was\nworth it.
I taught MEOWTH\nmoves for taking\ron any type…
I think electric-\nity is the most\cimportant thing in\nour daily lives.\cIf it weren't,\npeople wouldn't\chave made such a\nfuss when the\cPOWER PLANT went\nout of commission.
I think there's a\nmove a POKéMON\ccan use while it's\nfrozen.
This machine looks\nthe same as the\rothers.
I think you have\nsome rare POKéMON\rwith you.\cLet me see them!
I thought I could\nwin.
I thought up a fun\nnew thing for the\rTRADE CORNER!\cI make a PIDGEY\nhold MAIL, then\cput it up for\ntrade for another\rone!\cIf everyone did\nthat, MAIL could\cbe traded with all\nsorts of people!\cI call it PIDGEY\nMAIL!\cIf it becomes\npopular, I might\cmake lots of new\nfriends!
I thought you were\nstaring at me\rbecause I'm cute!
I traded my best\nPOKéMON to the\rguy beside me.
I train to find\nenlightenment in\rPOKéMON!
I trained a lot,\nso I thought I was\ca capable trainer.\nI guess I'm not.
I travel the world\nto train my POKé-\rMON. I wish to\rbattle with you.
I traveled out\nhere just so I\rcould battle you.
I tried to copy\nBELLSPROUT's\cgentle movements\nfor battle…\cBut I didn't train\nwell enough.
I used to work for\nSILPH, but now I\crun research for\nTEAM ROCKET.\cA meddlesome child\nlike you needs to\rbe punished.
I waited around\nfor you!\cI'm thoroughly\nprepared today!
I waited for you!\nI even cut back my\cshopping to raise\nmy POKéMON better!
I want PP UP, so I\ncan raise the PP\cof moves. But you\ncan't buy it…
I want to battle\ntough trainers as\roften as I can!\cCould I get your\nnumber?\cLet's meet up for\nmore battles!
I want to battle\nwith you again.\cDo you want to\nexchange numbers?
I want to become\nstronger, but I'm\rnot good yet…\cCould you show me\nhow sometime?
I want to become\nthe trainer CHAMP\cusing the POKéMON\nI caught.\cThat's the best\npart of fishing!
I want to buy some\nitems that raise\cPOKéMON stats, but\nI don't have\renough money…
I want to give you\nsome SWEET HONEY,\cbut you have no\nroom for it.
I want to go to\nSAFFRON to see\rthe MAGNET TRAIN.
I want to know\nyour phone number!\cLet's talk about\nCLEFAIRY!
I want to let\npeople know if I\rsee rare POKéMON.\cPlease give me\nyour phone number!
I want to see your\nstyle in action!
I want you to\nraise one of the\cPOKéMON contained\nin these BALLS.\cYou'll be that\nPOKéMON's first\rpartner, <PLAY_G>!\cGo on. Pick one!
I want your\nPOKéMON. Please?
I wanted PORYGON,\nbut I was short by\r100 coins…
I wanted to battle\nJASMINE, but she's\cnot up to it now.\nSo, how about you?
I wanted to take a\nbreak, so I saved\cto record my\nprogress.
I wanted to win!
I was challenged\nto a battle down-\rstairs.\cIt's rough down\nthere. You'd\rbetter be careful.
I was conned into\nbuying a SLOWPOKE-\rTAIL.\cI feel sorry for\nthe poor POKéMON.
I was done in!
I was going to\ndazzle you with my\rprize POKéMON.\cBut your prowess\nelectrified me!
I was going to\nmake my debut at\rthe BATTLE TOWER…\cI should go back\nto VERMILION and\rredo my training…
I was having a\nnice chat too.
I was hoping to\nbuy some SAFARI\cZONE souvenirs,\nbut it's closed…
I was humiliated\nin front of my\rgirlfriend…
I was just point-\ning out…
I was no match…
I was told to give\nyou this if I saw\ryou!
I was too busy\nsinging…
I was tough at the\nBATTLE TOWER…
I was training\nhere alone.\cBehold the fruits\nof my labor!
I was waiting for\nyou. Let's battle!
I was whipped…
I was wondering,\ndo you happen to\rhave <wtext_ram StringBuffer4>?\cI can't seem to\ncatch one. What is\cits weakness, I\nwonder.
I wear shorts the\nwhole year round.\cThat's my fashion\npolicy.
I went to the GYM,\nraring for battles\ragainst trainers…\cIt turns out, I\nstumbled into the\cunused GYM next\ndoor.\cBoy, I was pretty\nembarrassed.
I wish my POKéMON\nwere as elegant as\rthe KIMONO GIRLS…
I wish to thank\nyou, <PLAYER>!\cI've been training\nall alone…\cI was happy that\nyou cared to call…\cI want you to have\nthis!
I wish you would\nhave lost for me…
I won't accept\nthis… No way!
I won't admit\nthis.\cI may have lost,\nbut you're still\cnot ready for the\nPOKéMON LEAGUE.\cI know. You should\ntake the dragon\ruser challenge.\cBehind this GYM is\na place called\rDRAGON'S DEN.\cThere is a small\nshrine at its\ccenter.\nGo there.\cIf you can prove\nthat you've lost\cyour lazy ideals,\nI will recognize\cyou as a trainer\nworthy of a GYM\rBADGE!
I won't lose as an\nangler! I catch\rPOKéMON all day.
I won't lose next\ntime, all right?
I won't quit until\nI win!
I wonder how many\nkinds of POKéMON\rare in the RUINS?
I wonder how many\nkinds of POKéMON\cthere are in the\nworld.\cThree years ago,\nPROF.OAK said that\cthere were 150\ndifferent kinds.
I wonder if I can\nbattle properly…
I wonder if there\nare any mountains\cworth climbing in\nKANTO?
I wonder what this\ndoes?
I worry about RED\ngetting hurt or\csick, but he's a\nboy. I'm proud\cthat he is doing\nwhat he wants to\cdo.
I wouldn't lose to\nyou in skiing!
I'd be happy just\nto own a single\rrare POKéMON.
I'd be strong if\nonly I could tell\cwhat my opponent\nwas thinking.
I'd have to say\nthat's my loss.
I'd like you to\nhave a NUGGET.\cMy PIKACHU just\nloves it.\cI'm certain your\nPIKACHU will love\rit too!
I'd rather pet my\nbabies than this!
I'd say I'm a bet-\nter swimmer than\ryou. Yeah!
I'll be looking\nforward to our\rnext battle!
I'll be swimming\nquietly.
I'll call as soon\nas I get anything!
I'll call you as\nsoon as I find\csomething. You can\ncount on it!
I'll call you as\nsoon as I get\rsomething pretty.
I'll call you if I\nhear anything!
I'll call you\nwhenever I feel\rlike battling!
I'll do anything\nto get my hands on\rrare POKéMON!
I'll freeze your\nPOKéMON, so you\rcan't do a thing!
I'll go anywhere\nif bug POKéMON\rappear there.
I'll head back to\nBLACKTHORN's ICE\cPATH and train\nsome more.

I'll share my\ngifts with you.\cLet me get your\nphone number.
I'll show you a\nreal battle!
I'll teach you all\nI know about BILL,\cso leave me your\nphone number.
I'll telephone you\nif I hear anything\rinteresting.
I'll tell you a\nsecret.\cBut first, we\nbattle!
I'm BUGSY!\nI never lose when\cit comes to bug\nPOKéMON.\cMy research is\ngoing to make me\cthe authority on\nbug POKéMON!\cLet me demonstrate\nwhat I've learned\rfrom my studies.
I'm ERIN. Want to\nbattle me again?\cI won't lose this\ntime!\cI'll be waiting on\n<text_ram wStringBuffer5>!
I'm FALKNER, the\nVIOLET POKéMON GYM\rleader!\cPeople say you can\nclip flying-type\cPOKéMON's wings\nwith a jolt of\relectricity…\cI won't allow such\ninsults to bird\rPOKéMON!\cI'll show you the\nreal power of the\cmagnificent bird\nPOKéMON!
I'm JANINE! Hocus-\npocus… Poof!
I'm JANINE!\cHow did you know I\nwas real?\cLet's battle!
I'm No. 4!\nGetting tired?
I'm a bit tired.\nIf I win, lend me\ryour POKéMON.
I'm a huge fan of\nCERULEAN GYM's\rMISTY.
I'm a sailor man!\cBut I'm training\nPOKéMON, so I can\rbecome the CHAMP!
I'm all sweaty.\nTime for a swim!
I'm always with my\n<wtext_ram StringBuffer4>!\cIt's so cute!\nI just love it!
I'm awfully sorry.\cThe EGG TICKET\nexchange service\risn't running now.
I'm beat!
I'm begging you to\nhelp.\cThere's no telling\nwhat they'll do if\cthey control the\ntransmitter.\cThey may even be\nable to control\cPOKéMON using a\nspecial signal!\cYou're the only\none I can call on.\cPlease save the\nRADIO TOWER…\cAnd all the POKé-\nMON nationwide!
I'm bored by fish-\ning. Let's battle!
I'm building up my\nlegs by bracing\cagainst the ship's\nrocking!
I'm checking it\nnow.
I'm checking out\npre- and post-\revolution POKéMON.\cEvolution really\ndoes make POKéMON\rstronger.\cBut evolved forms\nalso learn moves\rlater on.
I'm checking out\n<wtext_ram StringBuffer4>'s moves\cand devising some\nstrategies.\cWhen I come up\nwith a good one,\rlet's battle!
I'm confident in\nmy ability to\rraise POKéMON.\cWant to see?
I'm confused too…\nThe switch on the\cend is the one to\npress first, but…
I'm crushed…
I'm depending on\nyou!
I'm disgusted by\nwimpy people!
I'm done for!
I'm drowning!
I'm elated that\nmore people are\ctaking part in my\nPASSWORD show.\cBut when PIKACHU\nwas the password,\cit was uh… whew…\noverwhelming.\cFAN CLUB people\ncame in out in\cdroves, shouting\n'PIKACHU!' over\cand over. I mean,\nthey were loud.\cAnyone tuning in\naround then must\chave been shocked\nby the racket!\cAnyway, back to\nwork for me!\cLet's chat again!
I'm feeling great\ntoday!\cI feel like I\ncould boot even\rthe LEAGUE CHAMP!
I'm fishing on\n<text_ram wStringBuffer5>,\cbut nothing's\nbiting today.\cHelp me while my\ntime away, come\rover for a battle.
I'm getting really\nimpatient, waiting\cto give you my\npresent!\cHurry over to\n<text_ram wStringBuffer5>!
I'm glad I got to\nsee your POKéMON!

I'm going to train\neven harder.\cAfter all, I'm\ntrying to become\ra GYM LEADER.
I'm going to train\nmy POKéMON so I'll\cbe all ready for\nthe BATTLE TOWER.
I'm going to try\nto be the best\rwith my favorites.\cI'm not using the\nsame tough POKéMON\ras everyone else.
I'm gonna show my\ngirlfriend I'm hot\rstuff!
I'm gonna win,\nfor sure!
I'm good!\nYou can't win.
I'm having a pic-\nnic with POKéMON.\cWon't you join us?
I'm here to buy\nSURF MAIL to send\rto my girlfriend.
I'm impressed.\nYou're evolving\cPOKéMON, not just\ncatching them.
I'm in a slump.\cMaybe it's the\ngear I'm using.\cLet's battle for a\nchange of pace!
I'm in training.\nCare for a round?
I'm in training\nnow. I apologize,\cbut call me back\nanother time.\cOooooaaarrrgh!
I'm investigating\nMT.MORTAR, but my\rpal's gone AWOL.\cHave you seen a\ntrainer who has a\cSLOWPOKE that can\nuse STRENGTH?
I'm making my\nfinal preparations\cfor the POKéMON\nLEAGUE.
I'm not a baby!\cThat's not nice to\nsay to a lady!
I'm not a trainer.\cBut if you look\none in the eyes,\rprepare to battle.
I'm not good\nenough yet…\cAll right. This\nBADGE is yours.
I'm not in favor\nof overly power-\rful moves.\cI want to win, but\nI also don't want\rto harm POKéMON.
I'm not listening\nto your bragging!\cWe POKé FANS have\na policy of not\clistening to other\npeople brag!

I'm not much good\nat thinking, see?\cSo, I just plow\nahead with power!
I'm on my way to\nWHIRL ISLANDS.\cI'm going explor-\ning with friends.
I'm on patrol for\nsuspicious indi-\rviduals.

I'm outta here!
I'm playing with\nstickers I printed\rfrom my POKéDEX.
I'm practicing my\nfire breathing.
I'm printing out\nmy POKéDEX.\cYou can also print\nout stuff like\cMAIL and your PC\nBOXES.
I'm raising my\nPOKéMON. Want to\rbattle with me?
I'm raising POKé-\nMON too!\cWill you battle\nwith me?
I'm raising POKé-\nMON too.\cThey serve as my\nprivate guards.
I'm raring to shop\nagain today!
I'm really good at\nboth fishing and\rPOKéMON.\cI'm not about to\nlose to any kid!
I'm really, really\ntough!
I'm really, really\ntough!\cIs there anywhere\nI can prove how\rtough I really am?
I'm saving up for\nthe next bargain\csale. When's the\nnext one?
I'm scared about\nwhat might happen.\cMy POKéMON are way\ntoo strong.
I'm second.\nNow it's serious!
I'm so bored.\nWant to battle?
I'm so glad you\ncalled!\cI was just about\nto call you too!\cI guess we must be\na good match!
I'm sorry, but the\nMAGNET TRAIN isn't\roperating now.
I'm sorry, it's\nall my fault!
I'm sorry--I for-\ngot to thank you.\cThis is CHARCOAL\nthat I made.\cFire-type POKéMON\nwould be happy to\rhold that.
I'm sorry--the\nBATTLE MACHINE is\rbeing adjusted.
I'm sorry--the\nTIME CAPSULE is\rbeing adjusted.
I'm sorry--the\nTRADE MACHINE is\rbeing adjusted.
I'm sorry.\nThis would be your\csecond time today.\nYou're permitted\cto enter just once\na day.

I'm taking a break\non ROUTE 45!\cWhy not drop by if\nyou are free?
I'm taking notes\nof the teacher's\rlecture.\cI'd better copy\nthe stuff on the\rblackboard too.
I'm the CHAIRMAN\nof the POKéMON FAN\rCLUB.\cI've raised over\n150 POKéMON.\cI'm very fussy\nwhen it comes to\rPOKéMON.\cDid you visit just\nto hear about my\rPOKéMON?

Il y a bien\nlongtemps...\cLa tour prit feu.\n3 POKéMON inconnus\cpérirent alors\ndans les flammes.\cUn POKéMON aux\ncouleurs de l'arc-\cen-ciel descendit\ndu ciel et les\rressuscita...\cCette légende est\nconnue de tous les\cCHAMPIONS de\nROSALIA.\cMoi?\cJ'étais dresseur\nà l'époque.\rHohoho!
In ECRUTEAK, there\nwere two towers.\cEach tower was the\nroost of powerful\rflying POKéMON.\cBut one of the\ntowers burned to\rthe ground.\cThe two POKéMON\nhaven't been seen\rsince…\cKeep reading?
In the distant\npast…\cThis tower burned\nin a fire. Three\cnameless POKéMON\nperished in it.\cA rainbow-colored\nPOKéMON descended\cfrom the sky and\nresurrected them…\cIt's a legend that\nhas been passed\cdown by ECRUTEAK\nGYM LEADERS.\cMe?\cI was a trainer\nway back when.\rHohoho!
In the past, there\nwere two nine-tier\rtowers here.\cThe BRASS TOWER,\nwhich was said to\cawaken POKéMON,\nand the TIN TOWER,\cwhere POKéMON were\nsaid to rest.\cThe view from the\ntops of the TOWERS\cmust have been\nmagnificent.\cAt the time, an\nimmense, silver-\ccolored POKéMON\nwas said to make\cits roost atop the\nBRASS TOWER.\cHowever…\cAbout 150 years\nago, a lightning\cbolt struck one of\nthe TOWERS.\cIt was engulfed in\nflames that raged\rfor three days.\cA sudden downpour\nfinally put out\rthe blaze.\cAnd that is how\nthe BURNED TOWER\rcame to be.
In the past, POKé-\nMON used to light\cthe sea around\nOLIVINE at night.\cThe LIGHTHOUSE was\nmade in honor of\rthose POKéMON.
Incidentally…\cI'm impressed by\nyour dedication.\cIt's been a long\ntime since I've\cseen a POKéMON as\nmighty as this\r<text_ram wSeerNickname>.\cI'm sure that\nseeing <text_ram wSeerNickname>\cin battle would\nexcite anyone.

Oh, and I managed\nto barely defeat\c<wtext_ram StringBuffer4> the\nother day.\cI've never seen a\n<wtext_ram StringBuffer4> get\rthat strong…\cYou shouldn't let\nyour guard down,\ceven against a\nPOKéMON you're\rused to seeing.
Oh, and I saw a\nwild <wtext_ram StringBuffer4> a\rlittle while ago.\cBut it wasn't very\ncute, so I left\cit…\nPOKéMON have to be\ccute. They're no\ngood otherwise.
Oh, and listen.\nI missed catching\ca <wtext_ram StringBuffer4> by\njust a tiny bit.\cIf I'd been a bit\nmore informed, I'm\csure I would've\ncaught it…
Oh, and recently,\nmy PIKACHU beat a\rwild <wtext_ram StringBuffer4>!\cA wild <wtext_ram StringBuffer4>,\nI tell you!\cDon't you think\nthat's astounding?\cMy PIKACHU is\nawesome!\cMy PIKACHU is the\ngreatest!
Oh, and we had to\nbattle a wild\c<wtext_ram StringBuffer4> a while\nago…\cMy CLEFAIRY came\nclose to fainting!\cIsn't that awful?\cI hate those nasty\n<wtext_ram StringBuffer4>!
Oh, and we had to\nbattle a wild\c<wtext_ram StringBuffer4> a while\nago…\cMy CLEFAIRY got\nfrightened, so we\cran away as fast\nas we could!\cI just can't help\nfeeling protective\rof my CLEFAIRY.
Oh, bleah!
Oh, but…\nI'm not dangerous!\cI just want to\ncall and chat\cabout everything\nand nothing!
Oh, by the way,\n<PLAYER>.\cHave you caught\nthe legendary\cPOKéMON RAIKOU and\nENTEI?\c<……><……><……>\cOkay…\cIf you catch even\none, I hope that\ryou'll inform me.\cI'm counting on\nyou, <PLAYER>!
Oh, close! I lost\nby just a bit!
Oh, dang!\nI lost that…
Oh, dear.\nSorry, but you\cgot it wrong.\nPlease try again!
Oh, dear.\nYou've found me.\cPlease don't tell\nanyone about me.\cI'll give you this\nfor keeping my\rsecret. Please?
Oh, dear…
Oh, everything is\nso cheap!\cI bought so much,\nmy PACK's crammed!
Oh, fine then.
Oh, fine then…
Oh, gee…\cThe CAPTAIN will\nbe furious…
Oh, have you ever\nseen a <wtext_ram StringBuffer4>\rbefore?\cI just battled\none…\cIt was much faster\nthan I expected.\cI was a little\nshocked.\cI still won, of\ncourse.
Oh, hello…\cI still can't find\nmy granddaughter.\cIf she's on the\nship, that's OK.\cShe's an energetic\nchild, so she may\cbe bugging some-\none. I'm worried…
Oh, hey! I got an\ne-mail!\c<……><……><……>\nHm… Uh-huh…\cOkay…
Oh, honey. You're\nmaking a POKéDEX?\cIt must be hard if\nPOKéMON won't\cappear. Try using\nthis TM.
Oh, how disap-\npointing…
Oh, how nasty!\nYou were serious!
Oh, how rude! Wait\ntill next time!
Oh, look at all\nyour BADGES. No\cwonder I couldn't\nwin!
Oh, make it forget\n<wtext_ram StringBuffer1>?
Oh, man… My boss\nis going to be\rsteaming…\cThe FARFETCH'D\nthat CUTS trees\cfor charcoal took\noff on me.\cI can't go looking\nfor it here in the\rILEX FOREST.\cIt's too big, dark\nand scary for me…

Oh, no picture?\nCome again, OK?
Oh, no!
Oh, no! I just\ncan't win…
Oh, no! My beauti-\nful POKéMON!
Oh, no! They're so\nuseless!
Oh, no!\nHow could I lose?
Oh, no, no, no!
Oh, no, no, no!\cWe've been off the\nair ever since the\cPOWER PLANT shut\ndown.\cAll my efforts to\nstart this station\cwould be wasted if\nI can't broadcast.\cI'll be ruined!
Oh, no, no… That's\nthe same as being\rrobbed.
Oh, no. I've lost\nsomething that's\rvery important.
Oh, no. Oh, no…\cMy daughter is\nmissing.\cNo… She couldn't\nhave gone to the\rBURNED TOWER.\cI told her not to\ngo near it…\cPeople seem to\ndisappear there…\cOh, what should I\ndo…?
Oh, no. You can't\ncarry any more\rPOKéMON with you.\cI'll wait here\nwhile you make\rroom for the EGG.
Oh, no. You made\nWHITNEY cry.\cIt's OK. She'll\nstop soon. She\calways cries when\nshe loses.
Oh, no… What'll\nI do if he comes\rback?
Oh, oh, I lost!\nThanks. Bye!
Oh, oh, oh!

Oh, rats!

Oh, you are a cute\nlittle trainer! \cI like you, but I\nwon't hold back!
Oh, you are very\nstrong.
Oh, you collect\nPOKéMON? My son\rBILL is an expert.\cHe just got called\nto the POKéMON\cCENTER in ECRUTEAK\nCITY.\cMy husband went\noff to the GAME\cCORNER without\nbeing called…
Oh, you have no\nspace for this.\cStop in at any\nPOKéMON CENTER\cacross the country\nto pick it up.
Oh, you have some\nrare POKéMON.
Oh, you have to\nhear this.\cMy <wtext_ram StringBuffer4> is\nso adorable!\cIt always wants to\nnuzzle me!

Once upon a time,\nthere was a little\cboy who was given\na new BICYCLE…\cHe wanted to try\nit right away…\cHe was having so\nmuch fun that he\cdidn't notice the\nsun had set…\cWhile riding home\nin the pitch-black\cnight, the bike\nsuddenly slowed!\cThe pedals became\nheavy!\cWhen he stopped\npedaling, the bike\cbegan slipping\nbackwards!\cIt was as if the\nbike were cursed\cand trying to drag\nhim into oblivion!\c…\c…\cSHRIEEEEK!\cThe boy had been\nriding uphill on\rCYCLING ROAD!\c…\nBa-dum ba-dum!\cFor listening so\npatiently, you may\rtake this--TM03!
Once while I was\nbattling, my\cPOKéMON couldn't\nmake any moves.\cThe POWER POINTS,\nor PP, of its\cmoves were all\ngone.

Our CHAIRMAN is\nvery vocal when it\rcomes to POKéMON…

That is DYNAMIC-\nPUNCH.\cIt doesn't always\nhit, but when it\cdoes, it causes\nconfusion!
That item can't be\nput in the PACK.
That man's always\nwith his RHYDON.\cSays he wants a\nPOKéMON that can\rSURF and dance.\cIs he trying to\nmake a synchro-\rnized swimming\rPOKéMON?

That thing you\nhave--it's a POKé-\rGEAR, right? Wow,\rthat's cool.
That tremor was\npretty scary!\cBut I'm more\nconcerned about\rthis wall here…
That was a great\nbattle!\cYou and your POKé-\nMON are truly out-\rstanding!
That was a great\nbattle, trainer\rfrom JOHTO!

That's an\nEVERSTONE.\cSome species of\nPOKéMON evolve\cwhen they grow to\ncertain levels.\cA POKéMON holding\nthe EVERSTONE\rwon't evolve.\cGive it to a POKé-\nMON you don't want\rto evolve.
That's disappoint-\ning. That happens\rto be very rare.
That's how you do\nit.\cIf you weaken them\nfirst, POKéMON are\reasier to catch.
That's not the\nsame number.
That's not\n<wtext_ram StringBuffer1>.\cPlease trade with\nme if you get one.
That's odd.
That's quite some\nbuilding, eh?\cIt's KANTO's RADIO\nTOWER.
That's shocking!
That's strange.\nI won before.
That's the CUT HM.\nTeach that to a\cPOKéMON to clear\nsmall trees.\cOf course, you\nhave to have the\cGYM BADGE from\nAZALEA to use it.
That's too bad!\nYou have no room…\cI'll give it to\nyou another time.
That's too bad…\cLet me know if you\nchange your mind.
That's too impor-\ntant to toss out!
That's too much to\nhandle!

There are many\nkinds of UNOWN, so\cwe use them for\nour secret codes.

There was a loud\nnoise outside…\cWhen we went to\nlook, someone\rstole a POKéMON.\cIt's unbelievable\nthat anyone would\rdo that!\c…sigh… That\nstolen POKéMON.\cI wonder how it's\ndoing.\cThey say a POKéMON\nraised by a bad\cperson turns bad\nitself.
There was a trophy\ninside!<sound_dex_fanfare_50_79>\c<text_ram wPlayerName> sent the\ntrophy home.
There was this\nmove I just had\cto teach my POKé-\nMON.\cSo I got the MOVE\nDELETER to make it\rforget an HM move.

There's something\nwritten here.\cRead it?
There's supposed\nto be a big POKé-\rMON deep beneath\rWHIRL ISLANDS.\cI wonder what it\ncould be?
These binoculars\nlet me see far\caway. Maybe I can\nsee my own house.\cIs it the one with\nthe green roof?
They built the new\nRADIO TOWER to\creplace the old,\ncreaky one.
They ditched this\nproject before\rthey finished.\cI'm searching for\nleftover loot.
They have bargain\nsales here every\rso often.
They have programs\nthat aren't shown\rin JOHTO…
They hold practice\nbattles downstairs\rhere.\cI would love to\nsee how well a\ctrainer from JOHTO\nbattles.
They said you can\ntrade POKéMON with\ctotal strangers up\nhere.\cBut they're still\nadjusting things.
They were able to\nbuild this huge\cfacility thanks to\nadvances in wire-\rless technology.
They'll really\nsting when you\rtake a bath.
They're SPEARY--\na SPEAROW--and\rRATTEY--a RATTATA.
They're fresh out\nof POKé BALLS!\cWhen will they get\nmore of them?
They're holding an\neating contest at\rthe restaurant.\cJust watching them\ngo at it makes me\rfeel bloated…
They're so cool,\nbut most girls\cdon't like bug\nPOKéMON.\cI don't know why…
Thinking is my\nstrong suit, not\rbattling.
This BILL guy\ncreated the system\cfor storing\nPOKéMON in a PC.\cBILL's PC can\nstore up to 20\rPOKéMON per BOX.
This Bug-Catching\nContest winner is<text_pause>…\c<text_ram wBugContestWinnerName>,\nwho caught a\r<wtext_ram StringBuffer1>!
This DEPT.STORE is\npart of the same\cchain as the one\nin GOLDENROD CITY.\cThey were both\nrenovated at the\rsame time.
This DEPT.STORE\nmakes me realize\cthat GOLDENROD is\na big city.\cThe selection here\nis unmatched any-\rwhere else.
This GYM didn't\nhave a LEADER\runtil recently.\cA young man from\nPALLET became the\cLEADER, but he's\noften away.
This GYM has a\nslippery floor.\cIt's fun, isn't\nit?\cBut hey--we're\nnot playing games\rhere!
This GYM is great.\nI love boarding\rwith my POKéMON!
This MAIL isn't\nfor me.
This POLIWRATH is\nmy partner.\cI wonder if it'll\never evolve into a\rfrog POKéMON.
This POWER PLANT\nhad been abandoned\rin the past.\cWe got it back up\nand running to\cprovide power to\nthe MAGNET TRAIN.
This arrogant guy\nwas at CINNABAR's\rvolcano.
This battle…\nI'm bored!
This calls for\nextreme measures.\cI must take to the\nhills and train in\rsolitude.
This can't be…
This can't be\nhappening!\cI fought hard, but\nI still lost…
This can't be\ntrue!
This doesn't seem\nto work yet.
This doesn't\nconcern a boy!
This flying POKé-\nMON attacked its\cprey with saw-like\nfangs.
This happened when\nI was young.\cThe sky suddenly\nturned black. A\cgiant flying POKé-\nMON was blocking\rout the sun.\cI wonder what that\nPOKéMON was? \cIt was like a bird\nand a dragon.
This is DJ MARY,\nyour co-host!
This is MAIL I got\nfrom my daughter.\rIt cheers me up.
This is SILPH CO.,\nfamous for POKéMON\rmerchandise.\cIn the past, TEAM\nROCKET wanted the\ccompany because of\nthat.
This is a big\nroom, but there's\rnothing here.
This is a good\ntime to brag about\rmy PIKACHU!
This is a great\nfishing spot.\cYou saw people\nfishing? How\rabout you?\cWould you like one\nof my RODS?
This is a rare\nPOKéMON! Huh?\cIt's only a doll…
This is a POKéMON\nCENTER. They heal\cyour POKéMON in no\ntime at all.\cYou'll be relying\non them a lot, so\cyou better learn\nabout them.
This is a POKéMON\nMART.\cThey sell BALLS\nfor catching wild\cPOKéMON and other\nuseful items.
This is it--the\none we've all been\rwaiting for!\cGOLDENROD DEPT.\nSTORE's bargain\rsale is on now!\cWant it cheap?\nWant it lots?\cDon't miss this\nGOLDENROD chance!\cHuh? I sound like\na huckster?\cWell, yeah. I was\nmimicking them…\cAnyway, you've got\nto get there as\rsoon as you can!
This is my first\ntime here.\cIt's so big…\cI'm afraid I'll\nget lost.
This is pathetic,\nlosing to some\rrookie trainer…
This is the only\nplace where you\ccan buy LOVELY\nMAIL.
This is the sea,\nas you can see.\cSome POKéMON are\nfound only in\rwater.
This is what I\nwant PROF.ELM to\rexamine.
This is where I do\nmy training!
This is where we\nsailors work!
This is your CARD.\cOnce you've\nentered your phone\cnumber, you can\ntrade CARDS with\ryour friends.\c
This isn't real!
This item can't be\nheld.
This lake is full\nof GYARADOS but\rnothing else…\cSo the MAGIKARP\nare being forced\rto evolve…
This place has a\nmystical quality\rto it.\cIt feels sort of\nethereal even.

This was once a\nninja hideout.\cThere are traps to\nconfound intruders\rlike you.
This way leads to\nMT.SILVER.\cYou'll see scary-\nstrong POKéMON out\rthere.
This way to the\nMOBILE ROOM.
This week's ID\nnumber is <wtext_ram StringBuffer3>.
This will protect\nyou. Take it.
This world is in-\nhabited by crea-\rtures that we call\rPOKéMON.
This POKéMON\ndrifted in the\csea by twisting\nits ten tentacles.
This, this! This\nis yours! Ta-da!
Those POKéMON\naren't enough!
Though I read you,\nI still lost…
Three big POKéMON\nran off in differ-\rent directions.\rWhat were they?
Three years ago,\nTEAM ROCKET was\rforced to disband.\cBut we're making a\ncomeback here!
Three POKéMON may\nenter battles.\cAll three must be\ndifferent.\cThe items they\nhold must also be\rdifferent.\cCertain POKéMON\nmay also have\clevel restrictions\nplaced on them.

Tied against\n<ENEMY>!
To add to your\nPOKéDEX, you have\rto catch POKéMON.\cThrow POKé BALLS\nat wild POKéMON\rto get them.
To be honest, I\nwant a MARILL.\cBut I make do with\nmy cute SNUBBULL.
To enter a mobile\nbattle, you must\cpick a team of\nthree POKéMON.\cIs that OK?
To evolve, some\nPOKéMON grow,\cothers use the\neffects of STONES.
To get to PRYCE,\nour GYM LEADER,\cyou need to think\nbefore you skate.
To get to POKéMON\nLEAGUE, you have\cto get through\nVICTORY ROAD.\cBut VICTORY ROAD\nis tough.\cPractically nobody\ngoes there!
To make a trade,\nwe must hold your\rPOKéMON.\cWould you like to\ntrade?

To trainers, POKé-\nMON are their\rbeloved partners.\cIt's terrible how\nTEAM ROCKET is\ctrying to control\nPOKéMON.
To use the TRADE\nCORNER or read the\cPOKéMON NEWS, you\nneed to phone the\rMOBILE CENTER.\cYou must register\nat the MOBILE\cCENTER before\nconnecting there.

We beat a wild\n<wtext_ram StringBuffer4>…\cYou know, I have\nmore fun fishing\cthan beating wild\nPOKéMON.
We can easily beat\n<wtext_ram StringBuffer4>!\c…Huh? You too?\nIsn't that great?
We can heal your\nPOKéMON to perfect\rhealth.\cShall we heal your\nPOKéMON?

We couldn't win…

Works differently\nfor ghost-types.
Would you be my\npractice partner\ragain sometime?\cI'll be waiting on\n<text_ram wStringBuffer5>.\c…Could you take it\na little easier on\rme next time?

Wow, the BATTLE\nTOWER is huge! My\cneck is tired from\nlooking up at it.
Wow, the BATTLE\nTOWER is huge!\cSince there are a\nwhole bunch of\ctrainers inside,\nthere must also be\ca wide variety of\nPOKéMON.
Wow, the BATTLE\nTOWER is huge!\cThere must be many\nkinds of POKéMON\rin there!

Yesterday a wild\n<wtext_ram StringBuffer4> slipped\caway from me, in\nfront of my kid.\cI was feeling down\nabout it until he\cshared his POKé\nBALLS with me.\cHahah, that sure\nmade my day!
Yesterday, I went\nout to NEW BARK\cTOWN.  There was a\nlady who looked a\clot like you,\n<PLAY_G>.\cWhat? That lady\nwas your mom?\cAww, I should've\nintroduced myself!\cI bet your mom's\nreally proud of\call that you've\naccomplished.\cHeh, put it this\nway. I'd be proud\cif I were your\nmom, believe me!
Yesterday, PROF.\nOAK was in the\cstudio to tape his\nshow.\cSo I went over and\nintroduced myself.\cGet this--he tunes\nin to my program!\cOh! Here comes\nPROF.OAK again!\cI'm going to chat\nhim up again!\cCatch you later!
Yikes! I've got\nprune skin!
Yikes! Not fast\nenough!
Yikes! Sorry!
Yikes! You've got\nawesome torque!
Yo! CHAMP in\nmaking! That GYM\cdidn't give you\nmuch trouble.\cThe way you took\ncharge was really\cinspiring. I mean\nthat seriously.
Yo! CHAMP in\nmaking! You're\creally rocking.\nAre you battling\cthe GYM LEADERS of\nKANTO?\cThey're strong and\ndedicated people,\cjust like JOHTO's\nGYM LEADERS.
Yo! CHAMP in\nmaking!\cIt's been a long\njourney, but we\care almost done!\nCount on me!\cCLAIR uses the\nmythical and sac-\rred dragon-type\rPOKéMON.\cYou can't damage\nthem very easily.\cBut you know,\nthey're supposed\cto be weak against\nice-type moves.
Yo! CHAMP in\nmaking!\cSince MISTY was\naway, I went out\cfor some fun too.\nHe-he-he.
Yo! CHAMP in\nmaking!\cThis GYM is home\nto normal-type\rPOKéMON trainers.\cI recommend you\nuse fighting-type\rPOKéMON.
Yo! CHAMP in\nmaking!\cYou lucked out\nthis time.\cLT.SURGE is very\ncautious. He has\ctraps set all over\nthe GYM.\cBut--he-heh--the\ntraps aren't\ractive right now.\cYou'll have no\nproblem getting to\rLT.SURGE.
Yo! MARKUS!
Yo! You're spunky!\nBut you know what?\cWhen it comes to\nsheer spunkiness,\rI'm the man!
Yo!\c… Huh? It's over\nalready?\cSorry, sorry!\cCINNABAR GYM was\ngone, so I didn't\cknow where to find\nyou.\cBut, hey, you're\nplenty strong even\cwithout my advice.\nI knew you'd win!
Yo, CHAMP in\nmaking!\cA trainer as\nskilled as you\cdoesn't need to be\ntold how to deal\cwith psychic-type\nPOKéMON, right?\cI expect great\nthings from you!\cGood luck!
Yo, CHAMP in\nmaking!\cHow's it going?\nLooks like you're\ron a roll.\cThe GYM LEADER is\na guy who battled\cthe CHAMPION three\nyears ago.\cHe's no pushover.\cGive it everything\nyou've got!
Yo, CHAMP in\nmaking!\cWhoops! Take a\ngood look around\cyou. The trainers\nall look like the\rLEADER, JANINE.\cWhich of them is\nthe real JANINE?
Yo, challenger!\cBUGSY's young, but\nhis knowledge of\cbug POKéMON is for\nreal.\cIt's going to be\ntough without my\radvice.\cLet's see… Bug\nPOKéMON don't like\rfire.\cFlying-type moves\nare super-effec-\rtive too.
Yo, kid. How are\nthey biting?
Yo, <PLAYER>! How's\nit going?\cThis is <wtext_ram StringBuffer3>.\nGot a minute?
Yo, <PLAYER>! You\nfree right now?\cIt's me, <wtext_ram StringBuffer3>!\nHow's it going?
Yo, <PLAYER>!\nHow're you doing?\cThis is <wtext_ram StringBuffer3>,\ngot a minute?
Yo, <PLAYER>!\nWere you asleep?\cIt's me, <wtext_ram StringBuffer3>!\nHow's it going?
Yo, <PLAYER>!\nYou awake?\cIt's me, <wtext_ram StringBuffer3>!\nHow's it going?
Yo, <PLAYER>!\cI hear PROF.ELM\ndiscovered some\rnew POKéMON.
Yo, <PLAYER>?\cThis is <wtext_ram StringBuffer3>\nthe HIKER!
Yo. How are your\nPOKéMON?\cIf they're weak\nand not ready for\cbattle, keep out\nof the grass.
You already caught\na <wtext_ram StringBuffer1>.
You and your POKé-\nMON should have\cno problem using\nthis move.\cTake this FLASH\nHM.
You are both kind\nand strong…
You are really,\nreally strong!\cThanks for taking\nme on so often--I\clearned a whole\nlot from you.\cI know! This will\ndo as my thanks!
You are returning\nto PROF.ELM?\cHere. Your POKéMON\nshould have some\rrest.
You beat me with\nyour speed…
You beat me, and\nI won't forget it!
You bought that\nalready. I'm all\rsold out of it.
You call your mom\nsometimes too!
You came at just\nthe right time.\cLet's battle.
You came from\nJOHTO?\cI hear many rare\nPOKéMON live over\rthere.
You came from\nOLIVINE?\cDo you remember\nthe four islands\ralong the way?\cI heard that a \nmythical sea crea-\rture is hiding in\rthem.
You came out from\nJOHTO?\cYou can zip back\nhome by hopping on\rthe MAGNET TRAIN.
You came out from\nJOHTO?\cYou can zip back\nhome if the MAGNET\rTRAIN's running.
You can cash in\nyour saved points\cfor a lovely prize\nof your choice!
You can catch\nPOKéMON even if\cyou have six with\nyou.\cIf you catch one,\nit'll go to your\rBOX automatically.
You can expect a\ncall from me.
You can find lots\nof POKéMON in the\rtrees of JOHTO!
You can have this…
You can listen to\nthe radio any-\rwhere. Tune in!
You can read it,\nbut don't lose it!\rROUTE 31!\cOh, yeah. There\nwas a weird tree\rblocking the road.\cI wonder if it's\nbeen cleared?
You can use only\nthree POKéMON.\cIt's so hard to\ndecide which three\cshould go into\nbattle…
You can't SURF\nhere.
You can't buy MAX\nREVIVE, but it\cfully restores a\nfainted POKéMON.\cBeware--it won't\nrestore PP, the\cPOWER POINTS\nneeded for moves.
You can't carry\nanother POKéMON…
You can't carry\nany more items.
You can't climb\nledges.\cBut you can jump\ndown from them to\rtake a shortcut.
You can't deposit\nyour last POKéMON!
You can't get off\nhere!
You can't link to\nthe past here.
You can't record\nany more numbers.
You can't register\nanother number.
You can't register\nthat item.
You can't rename a\nPOKéMON you get in\ra trade.\cThe name is a re-\nflection of the\coriginal trainer's\nfeelings for it.
You can't save\nthat much.
You can't take any\nmore POKéMON.
You can't take an\nEGG!\c
You can't take the\n<wtext_ram StringBuffer1> that\rhas MAIL with you.
You can't take the\n<wtext_ram StringBuffer1> with a\r<wtext_ram StringBuffer2>.
You can't take\nthat much.
You can't trade in\npoints without\ryour BLUE CARD.\cDon't forget your\nBLUE CARD!
You can't use it\nin a battle.
You caught all the\nUNOWN variations?\cThat's a great\nachievement!\cI've set up the\nprinter here for\rhandling UNOWN.\cFeel free to use\nit anytime.
You chased off\nTEAM ROCKET and\cwent to ILEX\nFOREST alone?\cThat takes guts!\nI like that. Come\rtrain with us.
You crossed the\nsea to get here?\cThat must have\nbeen hard.\cIt would be much\neasier if your\cPOKéMON knew how\nto FLY…
You defeated\nCLAIR?\cThat's amazing!\cI've never heard\nof her losing to\canyone other than\nLANCE.
You demonstrated\non me!
You did OK today,\nbut wait till next\rtime!
You do remember?
You don't have all\nthe GYM BADGES of\rJOHTO.\cI'm sorry, but I\ncan't let you go\rthrough.
You don't have any\nmore space.
You don't have a\nCOIN CASE.
You don't have a\nsingle POKéMON!
You don't have a\nPOKéMON!
You don't have it?\nThat's too bad…
You don't have\nanything to sell.
You don't have\nenough coins.
You don't have\nenough money.
You don't have\nenough points.\c
You don't have\none either?\cGee, that's really\ndisappointing…
You don't have\nroom for this.
You don't have\nthat much.
You don't have\n<wtext_ram StringBuffer1>? That's\rtoo bad, then.
You don't want it?\nCome again, hear?
You don't want it?\nThen scram. Shoo!
You don't want to\ntrade? Aww…
You don't want to\ntrade? Oh, darn…
You fixed our\nMILTANK, hon. Now\cit gives MOOMOO\nMILK again.\cHere's somethin'\nfer your trouble.
You gotta have\nPOKéMON to call!
You have lovely\nPOKéMON. May I see\rthem in battle?
You have magnifi-\ncent POKéMON with\ryou.\cHow about a photo\nfor a souvenir?
You have no coins.
You have no room\nfor any more\r<wtext_ram StringBuffer1>S.
You have no room\nfor it.
You have no room\nfor it.\c
You have no room\nin your party!
You have no room\nin your party.\rCome back later.
You have some good\nPOKéMON there.\cIt must be from\nthe training you\cgave them around\nVIOLET CITY.\cThe training at\nthe GYM must have\cbeen especially\nhelpful.\cAs a souvenir of\nVIOLET CITY, take\rthis.\cIt increases the\npower of grass-\rtype moves.
You have to have a\ngood ROD if you\cwant to catch good\nPOKéMON.
You have to hear\nthis! My lovable\c<wtext_ram StringBuffer4> looked\nat me and grinned!\cIt must be because\nour hearts beat\rtogether as one!
You have to warm\nup before going\rinto the water.\cThat's basic.
You have POKéMON\nthat know the HM\cmove FLY, don't\nyou? I envy you.
You haven't saved\nthat much.
You haven't tamed\nyour POKéMON.\cIf you aren't\nnice, it'll pout.
You know how POKé-\nMON have different\rabilities?\cPeople are like\nthat too. Every-\rone has different\rpotential.
You know the\nreceptionist at\rthe RADIO TOWER?\c'Welcome,' is all\nshe ever says.\cBut she's really\nthe chattiest\cperson at the\nRADIO TOWER.\cSo she must be\nholding back.\cIsn't that fun to\nknow?\cCatch you later!
You know what?\nA wild <wtext_ram StringBuffer4>\cgot away from me\nagain.\cIt was so close!\nReally, just a\clittle bit more,\nand I would've…
You know what?\nI got a good gift!\cAs I promised,\nit's yours!\cI'm sure you'd\nlike it. Come get\cit! I'm waiting on\n<text_ram wStringBuffer5>!
You know young\nMaster LANCE?\cHe looks so much\nlike our MASTER\rdid in his youth.\cIt's in their\nblood.
You know, last\nnight…\cI was so stressed\nout from work, I\cate a ton of junk\nfood!\cMARY and I have\nthis deal about\rlosing weight…\cThis won't do…\cHuh? What's the\nweight?\cThis has to be a\ntotal secret!\cMARY weighs…\cAiyee! M-MARY!\cUh… Um… I… Sorry,\nwrong number!
You know, night-\ntime is fun in its\rown ways.\cBut don't overdo\nit, OK?
You know, you are\nreally strong.\cBut I don't want\nto just slink off…\cI know! Could I\nget your number?\cLet's meet up for\nmore battles!
You know, POKéMON\neat BERRIES.\cWell, my POKéMON\ngot healthier by\reating a BERRY.\cHere. I'll share\none with you!
You like POKéMON,\ndon't you?\cMe too!
You look like you\nhave many POKéMON,\cbut PIKACHU is\nstill the best.
You look pretty\nstrong.\rLet me battle you!
You look so ele-\ngant, riding your\rPOKéMON.
You look strong.\cGood trainers seek\ntough opponents\rinstinctively.
You looked strong.\cI was afraid to\ntake you on…
You made your soul\nstronger, not just\ryour abilities.
You may enter only\nfive BATTLE ROOMS\reach day.\cPlease come back\ntomorrow.
You might have a\nhard time.
You missed the\nPOKéMON!
You must be a lot\nbetter now, huh?\cHow about showing\nme your technique\cin a real battle\nwith me?\cI'll be waiting on\n<text_ram wStringBuffer5>.
You must be hoping\nto battle more\cpeople, right?\nThere's apparently\csome place where\ntrainers gather.\cWhere, you ask?\cIt's a little past\nOLIVINE CITY.
You must be\ngetting tired.
You must have ice\nin your veins to\rdis TEAM ROCKET.
You must listen to\nPROF.OAK'S POKéMON\rTALK, right?
You need a POKé\nFLUTE to wake\rsleeping POKéMON.\cEvery trainer has\nto know that!
You need another\nten years of\ctraining to get\nbetter, I'd say.
You need at least\nthree POKéMON.\c
You need to fill\nup the POKéDEX.\cCatch different\nkinds of POKéMON!
You need two POKé-\nMON for breeding.
You now have\n<text_decimal wBlueCardBalance, 1, 2>? points.
You plan to rescue\nthe DIRECTOR?\cThat won't be pos-\nsible because I'm\rgoing to beat you!
You proved how\ntough you are…
You really are\nconcerned…
You received\n<wtext_ram StringBuffer1>!
You rotten brat!
You rotten little\npest!
You saved all the\nSLOWPOKE? Whew,\ryou're mighty!\cBut my grown-up\nPOKéMON are pretty\rtough too!
You seem to be\ngood at POKéMON.\cIf you are, how\nabout giving me\rsome advice?
You seem to have a\nstrong bond with\ryour POKéMON too!
You serious?\nThis is brutal!
You should treat\nit better. It's\rnot used to you.
You should use the\nright BALLS to fit\rthe situation.
You shouldn't be\nin here!
You shouldn't\nunderestimate the\cwild POKéMON in\nthese parts.
You still have <wtext_ram StringBuffer3>\nminute(s) left.\cDo you want to\nfinish now?
You sure kept me\nwaiting! Let's go!
You sure? Well,\ntell me if you\rchange your mind.
You there!\nWant to battle?
You think I'm a\nbaby?\rThat's not fair!
You think you're a\nhero?
You took a long\ntime. See this?\cIsn't it cute?\nIt's a PINK BOW.
You took on one\nmore battle than\cyou expected, but\nyou won anyway.\cAs promised, you\nwin a prize.
You want to be a\nleader?\cLet me battle you,\nthen!
You want to see my\nrare POKéMON.\cHurry over to\n<text_ram wStringBuffer5>.
You wanted to hear\nabout BILL?\cSorry, but I'm too\nbusy for you.\cI'll call when I\nhave time.
You watch. I'm\ngoing to get a\creal CLEFAIRY as\nmy friend.
You were great to\nbeat CLAIR!\cAll that's left is\nthe POKéMON LEAGUE\rchallenge.\cYou're on the way\nto becoming the\rPOKéMON CHAMPION!
You were in mortal\ndanger, but you\rare protected now.
You were simply\nmarvelous!
You will show me?\nHow good of you!
You will tell me\nyour phone number?
You will? Perfect!\nThanks, kid!\cMy pal's a chubby\nguy who snoozes\rall the time.\cYou'll recognize\nhim right away!
You won? Great! I\nwas busy admiring\rthe ladies here.
You! How dare you\nenter uninvited!
You'll battle with\nme again, right?
You'll be hearing\nfrom me if I find\rsomething good.
You'll be returned\nafter you SAVE.
You'll hear from\nme as soon as I\cfind anything that\nyou might like.
You'll need more\nmoney than that.
You'll run into\nmany trainers on\cthe way to CERU-\nLEAN's CAPE.\cThey want to see\nhow they stack\cup against other\ntrainers.
You're a little\nshort on funds.
You're a rookie\ntrainer, aren't\ryou? I can tell!\cThat's OK! Every-\none is a rookie\rat some point!\cIf you'd like, I\ncan teach you a\rfew things.
You're a tough\nlittle kid.
You're a POKéMON\ntrainer, right?\cThen you have to\nbattle!
You're already\nSURFING.
You're amazing,\n<PLAYER>!\cNo wonder POKéMON\ngravitate to you.\cI get it now.\cI'm going to keep\nsearching for\rSUICUNE.\cI'm sure we'll see\neach other again.\cSee you around!
You're awesome!\nI like you!\cI look for POKéMON\nhere every day.\cWhen I'm in the\ngrass, I find all\rkinds of BERRIES.\cIf you'd like,\nI'll share some.\cCould I get your\nphone number?
You're cold. I may\nas well head to\rthe mountains…
You're collecting\nevery single kind\rof POKéMON?\cThat must be quite\na challenge, but\rit sounds fun too.
You're from JOHTO,\naren't you?\cHow do you like\nKANTO? It's nice,\rdon't you agree?
You're getting\ngood at this.\cBut you have a\nlong way to go.
You're going to\nregret it…\cAnd I won't care…
You're headed to\nAZALEA, are you?\cLet my POKéMON see\nif you are good\renough to battle.
You're here to\ndefeat LT.SURGE?\cNot if I can help\nit!

…Darn… I still\ncan't win…\cI… I have to think\nmore about my\rPOKéMON…\cHumph! Try not to\nlose!
…Grumble…
…Gulp… Chew…
…Hmmm…
…Humph! I knew\nyou were lying.
…Humph!\cThis is why I hate\nbattling wimps.\cIt's just a waste\nof my time.
…Humph!\cThis is why I hate\nbattling wimps.\cThere's no\nchallenge in it.
…Humph!\cWhen it comes down\nto it, nothing can\rbeat power.\cI don't need any-\nthing else.
…I couldn't win…\cI gave it every-\nthing I had…\cWhat you possess,\nand what I lack…\cI'm beginning to\nunderstand what\cthat dragon master\nsaid to me…
…I don't under-\nstand…\cIs what that LANCE\nguy said true?\cThat I don't treat\nPOKéMON properly?\cLove…\cTrust…\cAre they really\nwhat I lack?\cAre they keeping\nme from winning?\cI… I just don't\nunderstand.\cBut it's not going\nto end here.\cNot now. Not\nbecause of this.\cI won't give up my\ndream of becoming\cthe world's best\nPOKéMON trainer!
…I hear some-\nthing!
…I want one of\nyour POKéMON.
…I will tell you\nthe truth…
…I won't turn tail\nin battle!
…It's over.\cBut it's an odd\nfeeling.\cI'm not angry that\nI lost. In fact, I\rfeel happy.\cHappy that I\nwitnessed the rise\cof a great new\nCHAMPION!
…May I ask you to\nget some medicine\rfor me? Please?
…Snarfle, chew…
…Sniff…\cWhat? What do you\nwant? A BADGE?\cOh, right.\nI forgot. Here's\rPLAINBADGE.

…Thank you for\nyour help at the\rLIGHTHOUSE…\cBut this is dif-\nferent. Please\callow me to intro-\nduce myself.\cI am JASMINE, a\nGYM LEADER. I use\rthe steel-type.\c…Do you know about\nthe steel-type?\cIt's a type that\nwas only recently\rdiscovered.\c…Um… May I begin?
…This hideout is\ndone for…\cBut that's fine.\nThe broadcast ex-\rperiment was a\rtotal success.\cIt doesn't matter\nwhat happens to\rthis hideout now.\cWe have much big-\nger plans.\cYou'll come to\nappreciate TEAM\cROCKET's true\npower soon enough.\cEnjoy yourself\nwhile you can…\cFufufufu…

…Whew!
…Whew.\cYou have become\ntruly powerful,\r<PLAY_G>.\cYour POKéMON have\nresponded to your\cstrong and up-\nstanding nature.\cAs a trainer, you\nwill continue to\cgrow strong with\nyour POKéMON.
…Why…\nWhy do I lose?\cI've assembled the\ntoughest POKéMON.\cI didn't ease up\non the gas.\cSo why do I lose?
…Yeah, and the\nGYM in CINNABAR's\cgone. I was really\namazed.\c…Yes? I'm on the\nphone. Go away!
…You are a better\ntrainer than me,\cin both skill and\nkindness.\cIn accordance with\nLEAGUE rules, I\cconfer upon you\nthis BADGE.
…You could use\nthat TM to teach\rIRON TAIL.
…You don't have\nenough coins here…
…You have strayed\nfar…\cHere I have medi-\ntated. Inside me,\ca new power has\nbeen awakened.\cLet me share my\npower with your\cPOKéMON.\nTake this, child.
…Zzzz… Huh?\cWhat's that? You\nhave MAIL for me?
…\nI haven't given up\non becoming the\rgreatest trainer…\cI'm going to find\nout why I can't\cwin and become\nstronger…\cWhen I do, I will\nchallenge you.\cAnd I'll beat you\ndown with all my\rpower.\c…Humph! You keep\nat it until then.
…\n…I'll go train\nsome more…
…sigh… I moved\nhere, but I can't\csell my BICYCLES.\nWhy is that?\cCould you ride a\nBICYCLE and adver-\rtise for me?
…sigh… I must\ntrain some more…
…sigh… Oh, for\nthe kindness of\rpeople…
…sigh… That\nstolen POKéMON.\cI wonder how it's\ndoing.\cThey say a POKéMON\nraised by a bad\cperson turns bad\nitself.
…<PLAY_G>. The\nroad to the\cchampionship will\nbe a long one.\cBefore you leave,\nmake sure that you\rtalk to your mom.
…\nLink closed…
…\nWhat? <PLAYER>?\c…No, I won't\nbattle you now…\cMy POKéMON aren't\nready to beat you.\cI can't push them\ntoo hard now.\cI have to be dis-\nciplined to become\cthe greatest POKé-\nMON trainer…
…\n…Humph!\cHe claims to be\nthe ELDER but\rhe's weak.\cIt stands to\nreason.\cI'd never lose to\nfools who babble\cabout being nice\nto POKéMON.\cI only care about\nstrong POKéMON\rthat can win.\cI really couldn't\ncare less about\rweak POKéMON.
…\cDidn't I tell you\nthat I was going\cto destroy TEAM\nROCKET?\c…Tell me, who was\nthe guy in the\ccape who used\ndragon POKéMON?\cMy POKéMON were no\nmatch at all.\cI don't care that\nI lost. I can beat\chim by getting\nstronger POKéMON.\cIt's what he said\nthat bothers me…\cHe told me that\nI don't love and\ctrust my POKéMON\nenough.\cI'm furious that I\nlost to a bleeding\rheart like him.\c…Humph! I don't\nhave the time for\rthe likes of you!
…\cI lost while I had\nmy eyes closed…
…\cOK--I lost…
…\cWhew…\nWith my partners,\cI'm going to be\nthe CHAMPION!
…\cWhew…\cLearn to stay out\nof my way…
…\cYou again?\cThere's no need to\npanic. I don't\cbother with wimps\nlike you.\cSpeaking of weak-\nlings, the city's\cGYM LEADER isn't\nhere.\cSupposedly taking\ncare of a sick\cPOKéMON at the\nLIGHTHOUSE.\cHumph! Boo-hoo!\nJust let sick\rPOKéMON go!\cA POKéMON that\ncan't battle is\rworthless!\cWhy don't you go\ntrain at the\rLIGHTHOUSE?\cWho knows. It may\nmake you a bit\rless weak!
…\cYou say what? TEAM\nROCKET bye-bye a\cgo-go? Broken it\nis says you?\cOh, no! Should I\ndo what now on\rfrom, me?
