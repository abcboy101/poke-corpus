This is the famous, torturously long staircase of\nthe academy! Not an easy climb, is it?
Mesagoza is like a full table—it’s got the school,\nit’s got culture, it’s got everything!
There are lots of different people and Pokémon\nat the school—and you’re part of the variety!
Those Team Star kids are a little scary, don’t\nyou think?
I hear that Team Star races around every night,\nriding on weird cars of some kind.
You get to choose which classes you want to take\nat the academy, right? Schools are so different\r\nfrom when I was a student...
Hello? Yes, the students here are just the best.\nA huge help to everyone, really!
They don’t call it the biggest city in Paldea for\nnothing! I’ve gotten myself completely lost!
The green arrow in your map app points north!\nTo lock your map’s orientation so that north’s\r\nalways at the top, press the Right Stick!
The Pokémon League’s through that tunnel, right?\c\nThat’s where you get tested to see if you can\nbecome a Champion!
I just had my interview at the Pokémon League!\nThe interviewer was real scary, though...
Outside the city, you’ll run into tons of Pokémon\nthat you’ve never seen before!
You know Tulip the supermodel, right? Well,\napparently she’s a childhood friend of one of\r\nthe teachers at the academy!
There are tons of hills and cliffs up ahead. Be\ncareful not to get lost, OK?\c\nOnce you get through, you’ll reach Artazon, the\ntown of nature and art!
A famous professor unraveled the secrets of the\nTerastal phenomenon.
I hear the professor’s doing some amazing\nresearch at the Great Crater of Paldea...
Each night’s sleep brings you one day closer to\nschool! So make sure to get lots of sleep!
I wanna go to the big school too!
Time passes, weather changes...\c\nI hear wild Pokémon behave differently too,\ndepending on the weather and time of day.
This pond is huge!\c\nI wanna float around in it just like a Magikarp!
I feel like school teachers always get weird\nnicknames from their students.\c\nI keep hearing kids mentioning names like\n“Old Hass” and “Brovatore.”
Some Pokémon can’t learn certain moves!
I wanted to get a Tera Orb of my very own but\nmy grades weren’t quite good enough...
You have to be a good student to get a Tera Orb.\nThey’re too powerful to be given out willy-nilly.
This is Mesagoza, the biggest city in Paldea!
Sagu’s home ec is a really useful class to take!
Ms. Rai’s history classes are so much fun!
Now, which sandwich shop should we eat\nat today?
Shops in the same chain still have slightly\ndifferent menus depending on their location!
The Pokémon you see around town are usually\nsomebody’s partner. It’s best you don’t try to\r\ncatch them!
My Pokémon’s really sensitive to sounds!
Pokémon of the same species can still have\ndifferent strengths, natures, and even Abilities.
Rain in Paldea isn’t that cold and it stops really\nquickly, so nobody here uses an umbrella.
My son told me he’d joined some group called\nTeam Star. I have no idea what kind of sports\r\nteam that is, but I’m sure it’s very fun!
Look at this battle court right here in the\ncentral plaza!\c\nIt takes a lot of courage to battle here, since\nthere’s always going to be quite an audience!
I heard that other regions only have one\nChampion!\c\nIt’s really cool that Paldea has so many\nChampion-ranked Trainers, don’t you think?
I’m not a huge fan of shopping online... Nothing\nbeats being able to see the product firsthand.
Did you know? You can have up to six Pokémon\non your team!
Any Pokémon beyond the six on your team get\nsent to your Boxes, right?
If I gather up the materials dropped by Pokémon\nand trade them in for LP, I can buy what I want...\r\neven if I don’t have any money!
Mesagooozaaa, the city of leeeaaarning! ♪\nI studied at the school, my passion buuurning! ♪
The entrance hall of the school is full of books,\nand you’re free to read as many as you’d like.\r\nIt’s a great place for any bookworm!
I’m a graduate of the academy, you know!\nI wonder if they still do that Treasure Hunt thing.
The academy doesn’t have any age restrictions—\neven my grandma could enroll! Maybe this is a\r\ngood chance to redo my own studies!
The west gate is this way! Head out from there if\nyou want to go to Cortondo!
The west gate is down the other path—the one\npast the canned goods store!
This way’s a dead end! All you’ll find down there\nis the Go-for-Broke Grill!
I better get ready for the Treasure Hunt.\nNow where was Delibird Presents...?
There are a few Delibird Presents in this city.\nYou’ll run into one if you just head south.
It’s such a relief when there’s a Pokémon Center\nnearby. I like the music they play, too.
You can use a Flying Taxi to get back to any\nPokémon Center you’ve been to before!
So what’s the difference between a town and a\ncity anyway? Is it the size...?
There are three big cities here in Paldea! One of\nthem is where we are now—Mesagoza!
I heard there were unusual sandwiches being sold\naround here, but...where?
Sandwiches are so good! I wanna have one\nevery day!
Hee hee! Do you want to try making sandwiches\ntogether sometime?
The north side of the city is mostly residential.\c\nSeems they don’t let you live in the student dorm\nif you’re from Mesagoza. Makes sense, really.
It makes me so happy just to see someone\nwalking around with their Pokémon.
I love sandwiches! But this store’s sandwiches are\na particular favorite!
If you get a smartphone case at Delibird Presents,\nyou can change how your Rotom Phone looks!\r\nSo many choices... Which one should I go for?
Once I catch my own Pokémon, I’m gonna\nbecome a Champion-ranked Trainer!
Are star-shaped shades popular at the school?\nI saw a group of students all wearing them.
Each town’s battle court has a different color\nand look to it, you know?
That nice lady at the Pokémon Center always\ngives me little tips when my Pokémon get healed.\r\nIs it just me? D’you think she likes me?!
I’m having my Pachirisu hold an item I bought at\nDelibird Presents!\c\nPokémon can get all sorts of perks from the item\nthey hold, you know?
Good things can happen from time to time if you\nlet your Pokémon hold a Quick Claw!\c\nThey have ’em for sale there at the red shop!
You can reach Cortondo if you head out the west\ngate and just keep going. They have their harvest\r\nfestival around this time of year.
Bronzong is so soothing...\c\nIt lets me get inside it from time to time. It’s the\nmost calming, peaceful experience...
Well, I’m completely lost. Time to boot up the\nold map app.
Some meals here will fill you with Egg Power!\c\nThat’ll make it easier for you to find Pokémon\nEggs when you’re out on a picnic!
You can exchange materials dropped by\nPokémon for LP at the TM Machine!
Machines these days are so talkative! Even the\nTM Machine’s real chatty, don’t you think?
Pachirisu’s Ability is Run Away! It’s real good at\ngetting away from wild Pokémon!
Huh. Vending machines these days let you buy a\ndrink with LP too, eh?
The staircase in front of the school is famous for\nbeing torturously long. I certainly don’t envy the\r\nstudents who have to climb it regularly!
If you come across a sleeping wild Pokémon,\nthat’s a great chance to get the drop on it!
Whenever I see sleeping Pokémon, I can’t stop\nsnapping photos of them!
What was the new director’s name...Mr. Clavell?\nHe became director about a year and a half ago.
Do you know Nemona, the student council\npresident? She’s such a sweet young lady.\r\nShe always says hi when she passes by!
If you come across a beautiful view, don’t forget\nto snap a picture with the camera app.
Are you also the type that likes to chill out on\nrooftops? Well, make sure you don’t fall off.
You can buy academy-approved bags in various\ncolors at this shop!\c\nNow, which color should I choose...?
I need to get my hair styled at Salon Renacer.\nCould you kill some time around here?
Side part, romantic tuck...\c\nThey have some hair styles that almost sound like\nPokémon moves!
Maybe I’ll buy some glasses at the Spec Shack\nand get a new, bespectacled look!
I want to wear a stylish hat! But I also want\npeople to notice my hair!\c\n...Guess I’ll make up my mind inside the shop.
If you get cold feet easily, you need some nice,\nthick socks—and this shop has a great selection!
They’ve got fruit, vegetables, and even rice!\c\nSure Cans is where to go if you want to buy a ton\nof food and make heaps of sandwiches!

Good thing we had our Cyclizar to get us across\nthe Asado Desert!
Let’s give both our Cyclizar a nice wash to clean\noff all that sand.
I love my Marill just the way she is, so whenever\nshe starts to evolve, I do a lucky chant to stop it.\c\n“B Button! Put the brakes on this Evolution!”\nIt works every time!
Cascarrafa’s battle court is sunk right into\nthe river!
If you want to head to the upper tiers, just wait\nin front of the elevator here for a moment.
The river gets pretty deep up ahead! ’Course, if\nyou can move across the water, you’re all set!
Porto Marinada is across this desert! Make sure\nyou’re prepared for the trip if you plan to go.
I...I saw a tiny little Pokémon holding a coin!\nWhen I got close, it dropped the coin and ran!\r\nWhat even WAS that thing?
Maybe I should buy something for my Pokémon\nbefore heading home...
Why don’t Pokémon like to eat the same things\nI like to eat? I don’t get it.
The walls look just like cascades of water! I bet\nthey could help train Pokémon to use Waterfall!
Coming from Zapapico, I’m amazed to see how\nmuch water there is around here!\c\nIt’s a precious resource where I’m from.
Marill really love the water! They’re Water-type\nPokémon after all!
Whenever I can’t decide what to eat, I always\nfind myself coming to Jade Palace Garden.
This spot is for Cyclizar to rest and recharge.\c\nIt’s the least we can do to thank them for carrying\nus around.
They call Cascarrafa the City of Water! I’m sure\nyou can see why!
The restaurants here are supposed to be really\ngood! I hear it’s because most of ’em use fresh\r\ningredients brought in from Porto Marinada!
I want to travel all over the place and take lots of\nphotos while I’m still young.\c\nWhen I’m a little old grandma, I’ll look through\nthem all and remember the good ol’ days.
Seems like the Kofu Lounge is the most renowned\neatery in Cascarrafa!
I want to go to the sandwich restaurant on the\nupper level!
I’m clueless when it comes to map reading...\nWhich way is north again?
North is shown by the green arc in your map app.\nWhy not try locking it so north always points up?
Cascarrafa was built on the side of these cliffs!\nThat’s why the city has multiple tiers.
Hoo boy, what a shopping spree! Where should\nwe head to next?
Let’s hit the market in Porto Marinada and shop\ntill we drop!
Oh, Cascarrafa, city of waterrr... ♪\nCarafes are vessels for water, etceteraaa! ♪
I heard that before they installed elevators here,\nyou had to ride Cyclizar up and down these cliffs\r\nto reach the different tiers! Sounds rough!
It seems only especially talented people are\nallowed to have one of those Tera Orbs that let\r\nyou Terastallize Pokémon.
They say that Pokémon can only Terastallize in\nPaldea. Now why on earth might that be?
Regular folk like us aren’t allowed to set foot\ninside the Great Crater of Paldea...\c\nI wonder what kind of Pokémon are down there?
Stop on by the Kofu Lounge! The renowned\nrestaurant of Gym Leader Kofu is right here!
People love coming to Cascarrafa to take photos.\nIt’s such a beautiful city!
You’re going to school next year, too, right?\nYou think we’ll make lotsa friends?
I can’t wait to live in the school dorms! I won’t\nget told off for eating candy before bed!
Tourists started flocking here after we added lots\nof blue around the city.\c\nThe idea apparently came from Kofu himself\na few years ago.
Every kind of sandwich, any way you want!\nCome on over to Every Wich Way!
Cascarrafa’s Gym Test is a real doozy!
Kofu is the face of Cascarrafa! He’s usually a\nmild, easygoing guy, but he shows off his cool\r\nside when he’s doing his Gym Leader thing!
I’d love to do a big bicycle trip sometime, but\nPaldea has too many mountains and valleys.
I heard they ride Pokémon other than Cyclizar\nin other regions. Wonder if that’s true?
I’ve worked my tail off this month... That means\nI can treat myself to a designer handbag, right?
I fancied trying out a new style, so I changed up\nmy hair! Don’t you think it suits me?
Errr... Did you get your bangs trimmed?

How are you liking Levincia? Business and tech\nare what we pride ourselves on!
The city’s main street is just north of here!\c\nNothing says “Wow, I’m in Levincia!” like being\nslapdab in the middle of all those neon signs.
Since we wear socks day in, day out, they just\ngotta be comfy as can be!
I don’t care if a bag can’t fit much inside, as long\nas it’s stylish!
So this is Iono’s Gym... I’ve seen it in her videos\nso many times—I can’t believe I’m actually here!
Did you see the latest episode of Iono Zone?\nThat collab with Tulip was great!
Iono’s super cute, isn’t she? She’s the most\npopular streamer around, hands down!
Having greenery around the city is good for our\nwell-being. Sure helps me feel less stressed.
Life in Levincia is exhilarating. There’s always\nsomething going on!
Right! Ultra Balls—you got it!\c\nYup, they outperform Great Balls on all counts,\nso I’ll go ahead and put in an order for 300!
When I grow up, I wanna be an inflooenser too!
You can make a living doing all sorts of things\nthese days!
I went to make a sandwich, but I’d run clean out\nof picks! Would you believe it? I go through ’em\r\nso fast, I’d better buy ’em in bulk from now on.
I could go for the Treasure Eatery in Medali, but\nCascarrafa’s Kofu Lounge also sounds good.\r\nShould we call a Flying Taxi?
I’m headed out to catch Pokémon later, so I want\nto eat something that’ll give me Catching Power!
I’m gonna wait till that Pokémon’s flying riiight\nover the ocean, and theeen...SNAP!
There’s boats ’n’ stuff down there! I wish I could\nsail to the bottom of the sea!
Levincia feels nice and safe thanks to all the\nsecurity cameras about the place!\c\nI hear the footage they capture is used for the\nGym Test.
Pottery classes in Alfornada—I’m telling you,\nthat should be our next big project!
Livestreamed Pokémon battles can be fun to\nwatch, but I want to see them in person, too!
Ryme’s new track just dropped! I gotta check it\nout ASAP!
Everything in Tulip’s limited-edition line of\nmakeup is so lovely! I’m spoiled for choice!
These skyscrapers are crazy tall! My neck hurts\njust trying to take ’em all in!
Apparently, all five of these buildings are owned\nby a real estate firm called Paldea Realty.
This city’s electricity is generated by a species of\nPokémon called Tadbulb! What hard workers!
M-my idol! He’s on the neon signs!!! He pops up\non one screen, then the next...then ANOTHER!\r\nOooh, Brassius...I’m your biggest fan!!!
You can use a TM Machine to create any TM that\nyou’ve ever gotten before!
If you had a Pokémon you could ride over water,\nyou could leap into the ocean without a care!
Levincia started out as a port town that shipped\nore from the mines to various other places.\c\nIt’s hard to believe that humble port went on to\nbecome the high-flying business hub it is today!
Where did the name Levincia come from? Is it\nfrom that old word “levin”? Or “leviathan”?\c\nOr maybe, ’cause the city has all these soaring\nbuildings in its Million Volt Skyline, could it be\r\nfrom “leaven”? Like, you know, rising bread?
You remember that famous professor? Haven’t\nseen h[VAR 1107(00FF,0202)]erim on TV or in the papers for a while...
I heard [VAR 1107(00FF,0001)]she has some sort of lab at the base of\nthe lighthouse over by Cabo Poco.
Changing up your look also changes up your\nwhole mood!\c\nYour day can go all sorts of ways depending on\nthe clothes you wear.
OK, we got Potions, sandwich ingredients,\nPoké Balls... Hope we didn’t forget anything!
We can always take a Flying Taxi back to the\nPoké Mart if we need to.
[~ 44]
Iono started out as a streamer quite a few years\nago now... Just how old is she, anyway?
My Luxio’s fur has a nice sheen to it, huh?\nI always give it a wash first thing after a battle.
One day, when I’m all grown up and rich, I’ll say\nto the shop man “I’ll take the lot!”
*munch munch*\c\nI heard the Levincia Gym livestreams the Gym\nTests of all its challengers!
*gulp gulp*\c\nI watched the Gym’s livestream of a Trainer\nnamed Nemona. Her Pokémon were awesome!
I heard the academy has mountains of books!\c\nWhen I start studying there, I’m gonna read every\nsingle issue of Occulture!
If you climb the lighthouse up ahead, you’ll get\na great view over the whole city of Levincia!
I like photos of scenic places as much as anyone,\nbut the most memorable photos for me are\r\nalways ones of people or Pokémon.

The STC was my idea, so I’m here to help out.[VAR 0114(001E)]
You’re in the middle of a Star Barrage! You can’t\nleave the base now!
Defeat [VAR 0202(0001)] of Team Star’s Pokémon!
Defeat [VAR 0202(0001)] of the STC’s Pokémon!
You used Team Star’s vending machine to\nrefresh your party!
Yeaaah! Go us! We sure showed that gate-crasher\nwhat’s what!\c\nGood thing [VAR 1100(00FF,0100)]she didn’t drench our Fire-type\nPokémon with a team of Water types! Haha![VAR 0114(002F)]
Wooo! That no-good intruder will think twice\nbefore [VAR 1100(00FF,0100)]she messes with us again!\c\nLucky [VAR 1100(00FF,0100)]she didn’t whale on our Pokémon with the\nFighting- and Bug-type moves they’re so weak to![VAR 0114(002F)]

Waheeey! That intruder won’t be bothering us\nagain anytime soon!\c\nGood thing [VAR 1100(00FF,0100)]she didn’t take on our Fairy-type\ncuties with a team of Poison or Steel types![VAR 0114(002F)]

They call it a Star Barrage![VAR 0114(001E)]

If your Pokémon get[VAR 1101(00FD,0001)]s low on health, come back\nhere and I’ll heal [VAR 1101(00FD,0402)]itthem up for you.[VAR 0114(001E)]
The grunts you’ll be facing will heal up their\nPokémon, too, so stay sharp out there.[VAR 0114(001E)]
You have no more Pokémon that can fight!
You were overwhelmed by your defeat!
Oh? It seems you can’t use the vending machine\nright now!
We’ll protect this base with all we got while the\nboss is away!\c\nIf you wanna challenge us to a Star Barrage,\ngo on and ring the bell at the gates if you dare![VAR 0114(002F)]

Welcome to Artazon, a town where the flowers\nare as bright and colorful as the artwork!
Look at the conflict on this Sunflora’s face! What\ncould the artist have been feeling?
I told my girlfriend clear as day, “let’s meet at the\nweird sculpture!” What’s taking her so long?
My boyfriend said we’d meet at “the weird\nsculpture,” but that hardly narrows it down...
Come on in and see if you can reach the center\nof Artazon’s famous hedge maze!
When the spring winds start to blow, Sunkern\ncome riding in on ’em.
Hmm, yes. Highly conceptual, accentuated with\ncontrasting modalities. Not that an amateur\r\nwould pick up on all that.
I came to see this famous piece! I can’t say I\nreally get it, but I like it!
Aw, not another dead end! I’m so lost...
Whoa, you actually found your way here! Nice!\c\nAlmost no one ever makes it this far, so I decided\nto make it into my secret base!
If you get worn out, try stopping for a breather.\nYou might notice things you didn’t before.
I can’t believe Sunkern turn into Sunflora when\nthey evolve! Evolution’s wild!
Check out my Cyclizar! We’re going on all sorts\nof journeys together!
This must be a Brassius original! Though the style\nseems a little...off.
I love high places! I heard outside of town, there\nare big, tall watchtowers in some places!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Text File : t05
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I came across the desert with Cyclizar, and I’m\ntotally exhausted!\c\nHealing up my team at the Pokémon Center gives\nthis human a chance to rest up, too!
This is Porto Marinada. Our famed market is\nalways bustling!
Come on up, stop on by! All our goods are\nfresher than fresh! Anything catch your eye?
Marinada comes from marinating, you know?\c\nWhen you soak food like meat or fish in lemon\njuice or vinegar sauce... Mmm, it’s delish!
The food here is really yummy!\c\nEverything’s fresh and wriggly! Kinda like me!
There’s a battle court right here in the market.\c\nNobody’s allowed to get into fights here—if\nyou’ve gotta work something out, you do it\r\nthrough a friendly Pokémon battle!
People say that a long time ago, ’fore I was even\nborn, there were always fights breaking out here.\c\nBut not anymore! Now we get lots of tourists, and\neven kids can walk around and feel safe.
Look at you, li’l M[VAR 1100(00FF,0302)]r.iss Student! Here to try your\nhand at the auction?\c\nCareful you don’t drive the price up too high, or\nyou’ll be crying into your empty pockets!
When night falls upon the city, ghostly Pokémon\nappear up above...\c\nWhy do you think they come?
A salty breeze coming in over the sea is so nice!\c\nI wonder if Steel-type Pokémon hate it, though?\nAll that salt must do a number on them...
It’s so handy having a Pokémon you can ride!\nFeels like I oughta return the favor and let my\r\nPokémon ride on my back instead sometimes! Ha!
More junk mail! Ugh!\c\nMaybe I’ll just crumple it all up into a ball that I\ncan throw around with my Pokémon...
These big, long metal box things here are what\nwe call shipping containers.\c\nWe pack ’em full of goods and things to sell,\nthen ship ’em off across the sea.
To get to other regions, we go by boat! Our\npoor Pokémon couldn’t carry us that far.
I swam to those rocks out in the water, and I’m\npretty sure I spotted something on top of them.\c\nBut I don’t know how to get up there... I’m no\npro at climbing cliffs or anything...
Yesss! I love goofy face boards! It never gets old\ntaking silly photos with ’em!
Hey, so, like...I get Finizen’s deal. I’ve seen them\naround. But what about that macho-looking one?\r\nIs that...a different Pokémon or something?
Oh my gosh, I’ve gotta get a shot of those\nKilowattrel flying over the ocean for my feed!\c\nYou sometimes find ’em resting on the beach\njust outside town, too.
Have you been to eat at the Kofu Lounge in\nCascarrafa? They serve up all the freshest hauls\r\nthere—direct from Porto Marinada, of course!
Ol’ man Kofu from the Cascarrafa Gym drops by\nthe market from time to time.\c\nThat old coot gets so excited whenever he wins\nat the auction that he dances a merry little jig!
When I was younger, I got into my fair share of\nbidding wars and brawls both. I was a real spitfire!
It’s such a nice beach, yet almost no one knows\nabout it! People just flock to the market instead.

This is Medali! Kind of sounds like “medley,”\nright? A fitting name for a town with such a mix\r\nof people and things!
Have you been to the Treasure Eatery? I hear the\nGym Leader is a regular there!
We have the best food in all of Paldea! Come on\nin and give it a try!
Our dishes here at Seafood Fresco are fresh and\npacked full of minerals!
I think your Pokémon is saying it wants to come\neat here at my restaurant!
I hear fancy restaurants have something called\na “dress code”...\r\nI wonder what kind of code that is?
I want to feed my Pokémon something tasty!\nI need to save up my money.
Our spicy dishes are the best! Come on in!
We are currently open to customers with or\nwithout reservations.
There’s a big gate at the top of the path leading\nto the Great Crater of Paldea. You can’t get in.
I heard that there’s an off-limits facility called\nthe Zero Gate behind the gate up that path!
Medali’s most famous restaurant, the Treasure\nEatery, is right here!\c\nWe also have the secret dish for those of you\ncurrently taking on the Gym Test!
I heard that you can change your Pokémon’s Tera\nType at the Treasure Eatery, but the chef turned\r\nme away the moment I asked about it...
How about a sandwich? They’re tempting even\nwhen you’re full—that’s how good they are!
Before climbing Glaseado Mountain, I like to\nvisit the shopping area in Medali and fuel up\r\nwith something to eat.
This town is an important hub here in Paldea.\c\nLots of people from other places come through,\nso naturally, lots of restaurants have popped up.
My little Greedent here has gotten bigger\nrecently. I wonder if it’s about time to move to a\r\nbigger living space...
The way up Glaseado Mountain is rough! Be sure\nyou’re prepared if you’re headed out that way.
This town doesn’t have a battle court, y’know?\nI wonder where you battle the Gym Leader...
Long ago, the space at the bottom of these stairs\nwas a stage for plays and concerts.
Hello there, young’un. Are you a student? The\nTreasure Hunt’s rolled around again, then, eh?

Welcome to Zapapico! It’s a mining town, full of\nhardworking folks.
Sure, big cities are fun to go visit, but plain little\ntowns like this one have their own charm!
The name Zapapico comes from a word for a\npickaxe. Fitting for a town of mostly miners, no?
Nothing like finding a bench when you really\nneed one! You’ll understand when you’re older.
I saw this Pokémon in the mine that was so big,\nit was like a mountain!
Well, I saw a Pokémon so long it was like a river!
Phanpy’s a Ground type! It’s resistant to poison,\nand it shrugs off electricity altogether!\c\nJust, um, don’t pour water on it.
My buddies and I battle our Pokémon on that\ncourt on our way home from work.
My job would be a lot harder without my dear\nCarkol around!\c\nBy that, I mean it provides moral support, not\njust manual labor...although it helps with that too.
Once, I was on the verge of fainting a little ways\noutside town, when a wild Pokémon Center lady\r\nappeared and came to my rescue!
Flying Taxi here! Take a ride through the sky,\npowered by Squawkabilly!\c\nNeed a lift? Just open your map app and give us\na call. We’ll pick you up practically anywhere!

Montenevera is a town with lotsa snow and lost\nsouls. But lately, the concerts are a real draw too!
The fluttering snow! The flickering candlelight!\nEvery day is like a festival here! Don’t you think?
The Snow Slope Run is popular these days. You\ncan try it out on Glaseado Mountain!
Isn’t Snorunt cute? Only the females have a\nchance of evolving into Froslass.
It’s cold again today. I’ll have something spicy to\neat to warm me up!
Do you know about the ultimate class of\nsandwiches? They’re called “Master” sandwiches,\r\nand no one seems to know the recipes for them.
Everything tastes better when you eat outside!
The Gym Leader here used to be Tyme, but she\nretired a year and a half ago. Her sister Ryme is\r\nthe Gym Leader now.
Have you ever seen one of Ryme’s concerts? Her\nmusic shakes you right down to your soul!
The stage lights up purple for the Gym Test! It’s\nso pretty!

Welcome to Alfornada, a town where you can\nsee the stars and find excellent pottery.
My family’s been making pottery for generations!\nIsn’t that cool?
The water’s trickling out...\c\nI wish it’d shoot out like Hydro Pump, though.\nWouldn’t that be neat?
This plate’s huuuge! How big of a sandwich d’you\nthink would fit on it?
Tableware made in Alfornada is popular all\nacross Paldea!
Pottery is born from the kiln!\c\nPotters put shaped clay inside and let it fire nice\nand slow for days.
The battle court here was originally built as an\nobservatory to view the stars.
There was a Pokémon that reminded me of tea\nup the hilly road ahead here.
Wasn’t it rough coming all the way out to\nAlfornada?\c\nBut now that you’ve been here once, you can use\nthe Flying Taxi to come back whenever you want.
Alfornada is in such an inconvenient location!\nHaving a trusty Cyclizar is an absolute must here.
I actually came to see the Gym Leader, Tulip. But\nthese plates are super cute too!
The Pokémon mosaic art on the observatory is\nreally cute, isn’t it?\c\nIt reminds me of some kind of old video game!

You’re here on some kind of school field trip, eh?\nNo wonder you kids didn’t look familiar!
Are the festival preparations going OK? We’re\nstarting to fall behind on our merch deliveries...
I’ve been perfecting my fried noodle recipe by\npracticing at home every day!
Peachy’s is such a handy shop to have around!\c\nSure, they’ve got all your item needs covered.\nBut more importantly, the little old lady who runs\r\nthe place knits THE warmest socks ever!
Kitakami Hall is just up this hill!\c\nWell, I guess it’s more of a mountain...but\nwhatever you call it, it’s all uphill from here!
Looking at Poliwag’s belly makes me dizzy!
Carmine and Kieran both got into a school in\nsome far-off region!
Is it true? Are those rowdy siblings back in town?
Once the rice fields turn nice and golden, they’ll\nbe ready for harvesting!
Let me get this straight—you put rice IN your\nsandwiches? Don’t see that around Kitakami...
Not a whole lot going on in this town, is there?\nThat’s exactly what I like about it!
This is Mossui Town, known far and wide for its\nFestival of Masks!
The local youth group is pitching in to make the\nfestivities extra special. We hope you have fun!
I saw the Loyal Three chowing down on mochi at\nKitakami Hall!
I heard some kid became friends with Ogerpon!\nI’ll bet it was Kieran.
I love Okidogi! So green. So cool!
I got to see Okidogi! The real one wasn’t as\ngreen as the Okidogi masks, though.
The real Ogerpon’s mask looks just like the masks\nthey sell at the festival—super green!
You know those candy apples they sell during the\nfestival?\c\nThey’re made using ingredients picked fresh from\nthe Apple Hills!
Which came first: the festival or the masks?
Mochi-mochi!
Chi-chi-chi mo-mo-mo...
Mochi... Mochi... Mo...chi...

Lacey’s really nice! She’ll teach you all about\nPokémon and make it easy to understand!
Lacey washes her Pokémon three times per day\nso they’re always fresh and clean.
Sure, Dragon types are strong—but to Fairy\ntypes, they’re no sweat!
I hear Lacey’s never been able to beat Drayton,\neven though her Pokémon should have a type\r\nadvantage over his.
The ocean is the true star of the Coastal Biome!\nIt’s real seawater, you know!
There are vending machines at the rest areas in\nthe Terarium! They sell all kinds of Poké Balls!
Dive Balls will give you a better chance of\ncatching Pokémon that are swimming.
If you see a little structure made of blocks, that’s\na rest area. Big structures like this one are plazas!
You should watch Crispin cook—it’s amazing!\nHe uses Magmortar’s flames to roast everything!
Fire-type Pokémon can’t get burned! Knowing\nthat can open up some options!
I love the Savanna Biome ’cause it’s where you\ncan find Blitzle—and Blitzle’s the greatest!\c\nYou’ll find different Pokémon if you cross over\ninto one of the other biomes!
You can face members of the Elite Four on the\nbattle court at their plazas!
Students can’t even challenge the Elite Four until\nthey’re a high enough rank in the BB League.
Trapinch gains the Dragon type when it evolves.\nIsn’t that weird? I wonder why.
It makes me all nervous if someone stands behind\nme while I’m using a self-serve healing machine!
Amarys is so cool! So impressive! She’s president\nof the student council AND one of the Elite Four!
In the Canyon Biome you can find lots of rugged\nPokémon!\c\nThat includes the Steel types that Amarys uses.\nShe’s this area’s Elite Four rep!
Skarmory are some tough Pokémon. Not many\ntypes can get through their defenses!\c\nThey really pull their weight—and ours—around\nhere, since they fly the Terarium’s Flying Taxis!
Apparently, there’s a Pokémon in some region\nthat’s Corviknight’s natural predator.\c\nImagine how terrifying it must look!
My boyfriend and I got to know each other by\nbonding over how much we love Corviknight!
I guess it’d be reckless and irresponsible to try\nthe Flying Time Trial on Trumbeak, huh...
This here is Chargestone Cavern! Watch out, or\nyou’ll get zapped!
Drayton’s in his second year, right? But I could’ve\nsworn he was a second-year last year too.\r\nAnd I think even the year before that...
The Polar Biome’s where Pokémon live if they’re\nreally good at handling the cold. It’s got a few\r\nmore Ice types than other biomes!
The Canyon Biome’s through here! There’s a lot\nof rough, rocky surfaces, so you might want to\r\nride on a Pokémon.
I heard I can get more rewards from BBQs if I do\n’em with friends! Guess I just need some friends.
Welcome to the Central Plaza, where the four\nbiomes meet!
The vibes around the League Club have been off\nlately, don’t you think?
The League Club used to be really fun. Not so\nmuch since Kieran beat Drayton and became\r\nChampion, though.
Not to be mean or anything, but I’m glad\nKieran’s not Champion anymore. I’d been hoping\r\nhe’d step down, one way or another.
I heard the new Champion isn’t even from our\nschool!
I’m so glad the League Club’s back to how it\nused to be! Battling each other is fun again!
The League Club’s way more fun now. I feel like I\ncan really give my best! I might even aim to join\r\nthe Elite Four or something!
The blocks you see around the Terarium give off\ninfrared and ultraviolet rays!\c\nApparently those rays help Pokémon and plants\ngrow!
Through here is the Polar Biome! It’s reeeally\ncold ’cause there are artificially-made glaciers.
Quests involving Tera Raid Battles are waaay\neasier if you do ’em together!
Me an’ my big brother do BBQs together!
That first-year, Kieran... It’s like he’s turned into a\ncompletely different person all of a sudden.
That Championship battle was something else!\nKieran seemed really upset afterward...
I heard Kieran’s taking some time off school.\nReally hope he gets better soon.
Only outstanding students get Tera Orbs! The\norbs are made out of some kind of really\r\nprecious material, they say...
There’s so much to think about with Terastallizing!\nSometimes it makes your Pokémon weak to more\r\ntypes than before!
The Coastal Biome’s past here! The flowers, the\nsea...it’s all Alola’d up!
Wait a sec. Do these blocks come in different\ncolors for the different biomes?
There was a TM on the blocks behind me. Did\nyou pick it up already?
I’ve heard things are strained between the\nLeague Club kids. Being a teacher, I can’t\r\nhelp but worry about them...
I’ve heard things have settled down between the\nLeague Club kids. Being a teacher, I wish I could\r\nhave done more to help...
I’ve heard things are better between the\nLeague Club kids again. Being a teacher, I\r\njust hope I can help keep them smiling.
Have you ever tried the Flying Time Trial?\nMagneton helps out on the course!

I’ve made up my mind. It would be for the best if\nI started accepting LP.\c\nLet me discuss it with the caretaker. I hope you\nwon’t mind waiting a little bit for me to do that.
Oh, I’ve got some big news, dear! I’m now\naccepting LP as payment for all purchases!\c\nThe caretaker even made it so that you can use\nLP to buy things at the festival stalls too!\c\nSo from now on, you can pay with LP whenever\nyou need!

Which course will you go for?
The Powder Snow Course it is! Have yourself an\neasy-breezy slide down the mountain!
The Blizzard Course! Copy that! Try to keep your\nfocus sharp all the way down!
The Sheer Cold Course, eh? Quite a challenge,\nto be sure! Good luck out there, kid!
You’ll need to ride a Pokémon down one of\nGlaseado Mountain’s natural snowy slopes...\r\nThat’s all there is to it!
Choose one of three possible courses and reach\nits finish line within the target time, and you\r\nmight just earn yourself a nice prize!
Have fun, give it your all, and see if you can\nkeep beating your personal bests!
Your best times, eh? Let’s see...
That’d be [VAR 0201(0000)]:[VAR 0201(0001)].[VAR 0201(0002)] on the Powder Snow Course.
As for the Blizzard Course, your best time is\n[VAR 0201(0000)]:[VAR 0201(0001)].[VAR 0201(0002)]!
And for the Sheer Cold Course, your best time is\n[VAR 0201(0000)]:[VAR 0201(0001)].[VAR 0201(0002)]!
Hmm... You haven’t reached the goal on the\nPowder Snow Course yet.
As for the Blizzard Course, you still need to\ncomplete that one.
And for the Sheer Cold Course? Yeah, you need\nto reach the goal before you can get a best time!
Yeah! I’m ready to go!
What are the rules?
What are my best times?
Never mind
Powder Snow Course
Blizzard Course
Sheer Cold Course

You completed a full run on the Blizzard Course\nfor the first time! Now you’re practically a pro!\r\nHere—this prize is for you!

The slopes weren’t your friend that time, eh?\nYour next try will be better, I’m sure!
Oh? It seems the Pokémon you’ll be riding is\ncurrently in its battle form.\c\nIf you want to take on the Snow Slope Run, your\nPokémon needs to change into its ride form first.

You want to know if your Pokémon have really\nbeen giving it their best effort?
Which of your Pokémon’s efforts do you want\nto check?
OK! Then I’ll have a look at how much effort\n[VAR 0102(0001)]’s been putting in!
Hmmm... Uh huh... Oh my...\nOoh... Wow, that much?!
Hmmm... I see...\nAhhh... Oh, yes, OK...
Wow, [VAR 0102(0001)]...\c\nYou’ve really worked hard! Here, I’ll give you\nsomething to show you’ve put in a lot of effort!
It looks like it can still give a bit more!
[VAR 0102(0001)] got an Effort Ribbon!
Your Pokémon’s clearly earned that Effort\nRibbon. It looks great!
Oh, that’s too bad...
Pokémon work real hard when they battle.\c\nThe more battles they take part in, the more\ntheir efforts stack up!

Hey, I can put any Pokémon that’s Lv. 50 or\nhigher through Hyper Training, if you’d like!
Whaddya say? Do you want one of your\nPokémon to go through Hyper Training?
So, which Pokémon d’you want me to\nHyper Train?
Maybe another time, then...
Huh? Sorry, kid, but it looks like you don’t have\nany Bottle Caps or Gold Bottle Caps.
Your Pokémon can’t withstand Hyper Training\nunless they’ve reached Lv. 50.
[VAR BD06(0000)][VAR 0102(0001)] is so strong, it doesn’t\nneed\r\nHyper\r\nTraining.
Do you want to use Bottle Caps or a Gold\nBottle Cap?
A Gold Bottle Cap (You have: [VAR 0201(0002)])
Bottle Caps (You have: [VAR 0201(0003)])
Never mind
So you want me to raise all of its stats?
Which stat do you want me to raise?
Hope you’re ready. Let’s get to Hyper Training!
That stat is so high, it doesn’t need Hyper\nTraining.
[~ 19]
[VAR BD06(0000)][VAR 0102(0001)]’s Hyper Training is\ncomplete...\r\nIt’s\r\nbecome\r\nstronger!
Do you want to continue Hyper Training?

Welcome. They’ll take your order at the front.
Hey, it’s you—the student who beat Larry! That\nwas some fine battling!
You’re something, kid. I’ll let you in on a special\ndish I only make for my favorite customers—\r\none that changes a Pokémon’s Tera Type!
I just need these special ingredients called Tera\nShards. Whenever you get your mitts on ’em,\r\ncome let me know!\c\nSince you’re a first-timer, I’ll give you enough to\nchange a Pokémon’s Tera Type to Normal!
Brought me some Tera Shards so I can whip up a\nTera Type-changing dish?
I brought Normal Tera Shards
I brought Fire Tera Shards
I brought Water Tera Shards
I brought Electric Tera Shards
I brought Grass Tera Shards
I brought Ice Tera Shards
I brought Fighting Tera Shards
I brought Poison Tera Shards
I brought Ground Tera Shards
I brought Flying Tera Shards
I brought Psychic Tera Shards
I brought Bug Tera Shards
I brought Rock Tera Shards
I brought Ghost Tera Shards
I brought Dragon Tera Shards
I brought Dark Tera Shards
I brought Steel Tera Shards
I brought Fairy Tera Shards
How does this work?
Not now, thanks
I’ll need 50 Tera Shards for the special dish...\nbut it seems you’re a bit short! Sorry, kid!
It works like this: I make a special dish that your\nPokémon can eat to change its Tera Type!\c\nI need 50 Tera Shards to make the dish, though.\nIt’s up to you to gather ’em for me!
Which Pokémon are you lookin’ to feed this to?
[VAR BD06(0000)]You want to change [VAR 0102(0002)]’s\nTera\r\nType\r\nto [VAR 0103(0003)]?
Hold tight, then. One life-changingly delicious\ndish coming right up!
[VAR BD06(0000)]No need for that.\n[VAR 0102(0002)]’s\r\nTera\r\nType\r\nis\r\nalready [VAR 0103(0003)]!
[VAR BD06(0000)]There you have it! Now\n[VAR 0102(0002)]’s\r\nTera\r\nType\r\nis [VAR 0103(0003)]!
If you ever want to make another change, just\nbring me more Tera Shards!
You, uh, might wanna wait until that Egg hatches\nbefore you think about changing its Tera Type!
That Pokémon doesn’t seem to want to change its\nTera Type!
I brought Stellar Tera Shards

Lately, I’ve found a coin or two lying around.\nPerhaps folks have more than they can hold onto.
I picked up a coin while I was cleaning. Had a\nfeeling it was yours—here you go.

Hoho! Hello there, child! I am a collector of\ncuriosities and a great lover of [VAR 0101(0001)].
I’ve an auspicious curio to offer—if you’ll trade\nme [VAR 0201(0003)] [VAR 1001][VAR 0109(0002)] for it.
[VAR BD06(0000)]Ah, it seems you haven’t got enough, child.\nWhy don’t you find some [VAR 0101(0001)] to\r\nbattle?\r\nYou\r\ncan\r\nacquire\r\n[VAR 1001][VAR 0109(0002)]\r\nfrom them.
Hoho! Very good, very good. I feel closer than\never to [VAR 0101(0001)] now!
Here’s the curio I promised you. Take good care\nof it—it’s laden with blessings.
Wait—I’m afraid you can’t carry any more sets\nof Auspicious Armor than you’ve already got.
Ehehe! Hello there, child! I am a collector of\ncuriosities and a great lover of [VAR 0101(0001)].
I’ve a curio with a...dark past, shall we say. It’s\nyours for [VAR 0201(0003)] [VAR 1001][VAR 0109(0002)].
[VAR BD06(0000)]You’ll need more than that, child. If you battle\nsome [VAR 0101(0001)], they may drop the\r\n[VAR 1001][VAR 0109(0002)]\r\nyou need.
Ehehe! That will do nicely. I feel more connected\nwith [VAR 0101(0001)] now!
Here’s the curio I promised you. Careful with it—\nit’s steeped in a potent malice.

Oh, hi. This is a home for Team Star dropouts.
... ... ...\nOperation Starfall? You’ve declared war?\c\nThat’s not really any of our business. It’s not like\nwe talk to the folks in charge.
Anyway, thanks for coming. Haven’t really got\nmuch to welcome a guest with, but...here.
You got the [VAR FF00(0008)]Sporty Cap (Star)[VAR FF00(0000)]!
You can stay and hang here however long you\nlike. If you need to get going, that’s fine too!
This is a home for Team Star dropouts.
We just got tired of Team Star stuff, y’know?\nWe’ve even started going to school on the sly.
Nice to meet ya! And when you go, like always...\nHasta la vistaaarrr! ☆
No one fights here. That’s why it’s such a nice\nplace—better than school, better than with Team\r\nStar, better than home...

My, my—I sense great depths to your past.\nYou must have seen much in lives gone by.
I can study your Rotom Phone to peer into past\nlives you’ve lived. I call it Rotometry! Care to try?
Hm, perhaps we’d best leave it alone after all.\nI can sense your suspicion of me...
Ahhh, your past... It drifts before my eyes! I see a\nlife you once lived in— Oh, where is this...?
Kanto?
Galar?
Sinnoh?
Hisui?
I’m good, actually...
Yes, yes! It’s coming into clearer focus! In this\nprevious life, you once tread the grounds of...
Kanto! I see you and a beloved Pokémon on an\nadventure in the Kanto region, urging each other\r\nonward with a bold “Let’s go!”
Galar! I see you facing down enormous\nchallenges in the Galar region with equally\r\nenormous Dynamax Pokémon at your side!
Sinnoh! I see you digging beneath the surface\nof the Sinnoh region itself and dazzling crowds\r\nin Super Contest Shows!
Hisui! I see you braving a great adventure in the\nHisui region, an odd phone gripped in your hand!\r\nWait—where is “Hisui”? I’ve never heard of it...
Allow me to fashion for your Rotom Phone a case\nthat befits your memories.
Aaand...there!
Your case is finished. Carry it proudly!
You got the [VAR FF00(0008)]Pika-Vee case[VAR FF00(0000)]!
You got the [VAR FF00(0008)]Ball Guy case[VAR FF00(0000)]!
You got the [VAR FF00(0008)]Pokétch case[VAR FF00(0000)]!
You got the [VAR FF00(0008)]Arc Phone case[VAR FF00(0000)]!
If you wish to plumb your memories for more\npast lives, come speak to me again.
Never have I met one who has lived so widely\nas you! I’m honored to have divined your past.
I hope your Rotom Phone cases serve you well.\nMay your past lives live on in them.

We’re getting report after report from academy\nstudents about their Pokémon getting injured.[VAR 0114(002A)]
We teachers have split up to investigate these\nraids, but we’re still a bit shorthanded.[VAR 0114(002A)]

Tera Raid crystals that get hit by especially strong\nblasts of this energy are apparently transforming\r\ninto [VAR FF00(0006)]black crystals[VAR FF00(0000)].[VAR 0114(002A)]
The Tera Pokémon found at these black crystals\nare incredibly powerful...[VAR 0114(002A)]
So much so that average Trainers wouldn’t stand\na chance against them.[VAR 0114(002A)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]You’re anything but average, but I’m afraid this is\ntoo dangerous—even for you,\r\n[VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(002A)]
Even if you find the location of one of these\nblack crystals on your map app, please do NOT—\r\nI repeat—DO NOT take on the Tera Raid there![VAR 0114(002A)]
Got it!
I dunno...
Hmmm... You almost seem a little TOO willing to\nagree.[VAR 0114(002A)]
I mean it! Don’t read into that like there’s some\nkind of hidden meaning![VAR 0114(002A)]
Sorry for getting you involved in this only to ask\nyou to step away, but...\c\nWhatever you do, do NOT go looking for these\nblack crystals![VAR 0114(002A)]
I’m counting on you to make the right choice\nhere![VAR 0114(002A)]

Ro-to-to-to-to... ♪
[VAR 0100(0000)]! This is Jacq![VAR 0114(002A)]
We just saw the Terastal energy reading from one\nof the black crystals disappear a moment ago.\r\nDo you know anything about that?![VAR 0114(002A)]
I won!
It sure was rough!
Whaaat?! You battled the Pokémon there?![VAR 0114(002A)]
*sigh*\nI thought I made it clear that it was too risky.[VAR 0114(002A)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Well, in any case, I’m just glad that you’re\nOK, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(002A)]
Your efforts have helped us come to understand\nthe laws governing Terastal energy emissions.[VAR 0114(002A)]
Thanks for your help. I’m sending you something\nas a thank-you gift.[VAR 0114(002A)]
Still, even after all this, it seems that the amount\nof energy being emitted is slowly growing.[VAR 0114(002A)]
That means we may continue to see more black\ncrystals appear in the future.[VAR 0114(002A)]
I don’t imagine you’ll listen to me even if I try to\nstop you, so I won’t be too firm with you...[VAR 0114(002A)]
but please continue to be careful out there![VAR 0114(002A)]
Ah, by the way, Director Clavell will be madder\nthan a rampaging Primeape if he finds out, so\r\nlet’s keep this between us two![VAR 0114(002A)]

Want me to judge just how big or small your\nPokémon are?
Which Pokémon would you like me to check?
[VAR 0102(0001)], eh? Let’s see here...
Now THIS is a BIG Pokémon! Wow, you almost\nnever see one this huge!
[VAR BD06(0000)]This might just be the world’s biggest\n[VAR 0101(0001)]!
This is a serious big’un! Feels comforting to have\nsuch a bulky, reliable buddy around, doesn’t it?
This one seems a good sight bigger than average!\nIt’s quite a specimen—take good care of it!

Come ask me anytime you want to know about\nyour Pokémon’s size!
Hey! Did you know Pokémon of the same species\ncan come in all sorts of sizes?\c\nTake my Pachirisu. It’s easy to see the difference\nbetween ’em, right?\c\nMe, I’ve got a sharp eye. I can tell the exact size\nof a Pokémon just by looking at it!

You got [VAR FF00(0008)]a variety of ingredients[VAR FF00(0000)]!
You put the ingredients in your Bag’s [VAR FF00(0008)]Picnic Items[VAR FF00(0000)]\npocket.
I just went shopping for sandwich ingredients and\nbought more than I could use. Mind taking some?
There you go. Try making some nice, tasty\nsandwiches! A picnic’s not a picnic without ’em!
Since you’re here, want to kick back with your\nPokémon at my picnic for a bit?
Hey, welcome to my picnic. Want to kick back\nwith your Pokémon for a bit?
Looks like you and your Pokémon got a good\nrest! Come on by and kick back anytime.
All right. But if you get worn out, don’t push it.\nJust come on by and kick back anytime.
My poor Bag’s full to bursting with ingredients!\nHere, lemme share some with you.
Sandwiches are best when you eat ’em outside!\nTry making some with the stuff I gave you!
Hey, since we’re here, want to have a picnic so\nyou can rest up a little?
Want to rest up a bit at my picnic?
You and your Pokémon look like you’re all full\nof energy! Come again anytime.
Aw, no need to be shy about it! You can come by\nanytime.
This spot is just about halfway between\nMesagoza and Artazon!\c\nI’m gonna make me a nice sandwich, then I’ll be\nall refueled and ready for more adventuring!\c\nHere—have some ingredients so you can get\nrefueled too!
Totally unrelated, but I heard there’s a cliff face\nnear here that...moves. Wonder if it’s true...
You should take a breather here and get ready so\nyou don’t get too surprised by any moving walls!
Are you running a little low on energy? Take a\nminute to rest and refuel!
Both people AND Pokémon need to refuel\nsometimes. Come back if you’re low on energy!
If you say so! Just remember not to push yourself\ntoo hard!
Whew, these hills are rougher than I thought\nthey’d be. I’m beat.\c\nTimes like these call for a nice meal to refresh\nthe body and soul!\c\nHere, take some of my ingredients to refresh\nyourself with!
Tackling tough challenges is great and all, but not\non an empty tummy!
We all need company and compassion, especially\non the road! Want to stop and refresh yourself?
Hills got you down? Need a little pick-me-up?
It’s nice to have a refreshing meal! We gotta help\neach other out in tough times. Stop by anytime!
Amazing what young folks like you can do! Wish I\nstill had that pep in my step!
Nothing goes with a sandwich like a nice view!\nHaha!\c\nGlad to have run into you, kiddo. Here’s a gift—\nmake sure to savor the taste of adventure!
Eating a sandwich and getting pumped with Meal\nPowers makes journeying all the better! Haha!
Care to rest those traveling feet and stop for a\nwhile, since you’re here?
Everyone needs a break now and then! Care to\nrest those traveling feet and enjoy the scenery?
Working hard is key, but so is getting off your\nfeet now and then! Besides, you can’t enjoy the\r\nscenery when you’re always on the move! Haha!
Fair enough—nothing wrong with living fast!\nCome by if you ever need a little rest.
I bought some ingredients on the cheap at the\nPorto Marinada market!\c\nBut I got more than I could eat, so...voilà! Have\nsome for yourself!
If you have a picnic with your friends and all\nbring lots of ingredients, you can whip up some\r\npretty wild sandwiches! It’s fun!
For now, though, you ought to take a breather—\nit’s rough going around these parts!
Going north or south from here is rough. You\nought to take a breather before you move on!
There you go—seems like you got a nice rest!\nGood luck on your adventure!
Ah, maybe you’re just headed west to Porto\nMarinada? I’ll mind my own business!
I saw some strange Pokémon around Casseroya\nLake, and they gave me a flash of inspiration!\c\nI came up with some great recipes—please use\nthem to make yourself some tasty sandwiches!
You learned how to make [VAR FF00(0006)]Sushi Sandwiches[VAR FF00(0000)]!
Now, I know sushi’s normally a rice dish. No\nbread’s involved.\c\nBut I figured...why not put sushi in a sandwich?\nThen you’ve got bread AND rice—twice as tasty!
Seeing as how we’ve run into each other at this\nnice lake, want to join me for a little break?
Ahhh, a lakeside picnic! Nothing better! Care to\nrest up?
I wonder what makes lakes so relaxing... Well,\nwhatever it is, it looks like you had a nice rest!
Got it. Come by if you’re ever craving a taste of\nthe lakeside life!

You’re good friends, all right! You definitely\nenjoy each other’s company!
You’re getting along well...but I’m sure you could\nget way friendlier!
You’re starting to get friendly. I bet you’ll get\nalong better soon!
You two seem kinda neutral—like you don’t mind\neach other. I hope you get closer!
Are you two just starting to get to know each\nother? I’m sensing some awkwardness here...
Oh my gosh! What happened between you two?!\nThere’s not even a smidge of friendship here!
I’ve got something for you to commemorate such\na nice friendship!

You learned how to make some new Master\nlevel sandwiches!
Those recipes make mouth-wateringly good\nsandwiches! Give ’em a try sometime!
If I think up new recipes, I’ll be sure to teach\nthem to you!
Oh, it’s you again! I thought up some new\nrecipes!
Oh, it’s you again!\c\nI’m making some new recipes, but they require\nsome very rare ingredients.\c\nFive different ingredients, actually. They’re\ncalled, uh, Herba...something-or-other.\c\nI bet I’d come up with a recipe right away if I\ncould just see those herbs for myself.
There are five of the Herba something-or-others\nin all.\c\nI bet I’d come up with some recipes right away if\nI could just see those condiments for myself.
H-hey! Isn’t that one of those Herba something-\nor-others you have there?!\c\nOhhh! I can feel the inspiration! The recipes are\nmaking themselves in my head right now!
*huff* *puff*\c\nThose are some wild recipes I came up with\njust now!\c\nGive ’em a try sometime. They’ll make top-tier\nsandwiches for sure!
Thanks to you, I was able to come up with all of\nthe Master-level sandwich recipes!\c\nThank you so much for helping me achieve\nmy dream!
I’ll bet there are still delicious sandwich recipes\nout there just waiting to be discovered!\c\nIf you come up with new recipes yourself, be sure\nto tell other people about them!

Hey, welcome to Blueberry Academy!\c\nIt’s pretty wild the first time you come to school\nby riding a subway to an undersea elevator, huh?
Way to go, new Champion! Pretty impressive that\nyou managed to take down Kieran.
Things have been extra lively here at school\nsince you showed up!
I forget which biome my next class is in...
We gotta bundle up if we’re headed to the Polar\nBiome. Brrr...
So you’re the exchange student people keep\ntalking about? You don’t LOOK that strong...
At our school, you won’t cut it if you can’t hold\nyour own in a Pokémon battle.
From how you look, I’d never have guessed what\na good Pokémon battler you are!
I can’t believe Kieran lost to you. Not even\nDrayton could beat Kieran!
I want to get as strong as you are!
Paldea must be full of skilled battlers like you!
Man, no matter how many Poké Balls I have, it’s\nnever enough...
You should go do some BBQs. Once you’ve\nearned the BP, you can buy some nice Poké Balls.
This court’s used for official BB League battles!\c\nYou should see how packed the seats get when\nthere’s a Championship match!
I saw your battle with Lacey! I’d never seen some\nof those Pokémon before!
Your Championship battle ruled! So is Kieran\ndemoted back down to the Elite Four now?
I saw your battle with Kieran! He sure looked\nunhappy about the outcome, though...
I wanna become Champion one day too! I gotta\nput in a lot of work first...
After seeing you battle so much, I think I’m a fan\nof yours now!
Here at Blueberry Academy, it’s Double Battles\nor nothing.\c\nI guess that’s probably because they open up\nyour strategic options.
Why not try catching a Rhyhorn in the Savanna\nBiome?
I just can’t get my head around the material in\nRock-Type Studies II...
Plusle’s Ability is called Plus!\c\nIt gets a boost to its Sp. Atk when it battles\nalongside Minun!
I can’t remember my type matchups. I keep\nhaving to look at my notes during battle.
Type matchups are much easier to grasp when\nyou think about how the world works!\c\nPlants wither in the cold, right? So logically,\nGrass types are weak to the Ice type!
This classroom’s actually underwater!\c\nThey just display video of the sky on these\nscreens so it doesn’t feel too claustrophobic.
When it’s night outside, the sky you see in the\nTerarium will look like night too. The displays are\r\nsynced to the real time on the surface.
Yeah, Carmine’s kinda self-absorbed, but it’s\nhard not to like her anyway.
Our class has Amarys, the student council prez...\nand Carmine, the student body pest!
Did you know that if you run in tight circles for a\nbit, you’ll end up spinning in place?
There’s this one spot down in the Terarium’s\nmeadows where there’s always a breeze blowing.\r\nIt’d be fun to go spin and spin in the wind there.
One time I was walking in the meadows in the\nTerarium when a breeze blew in out of nowhere.\r\nI thought I heard someone singing... So weird!
I wanna work at a Poké Mart in the future, so I’m\nresearching what items here are big sellers.
If you want a TM, but you can’t make it ’cause\nyou need some material that a Pokémon drops...\r\nyou can just buy the TM with BP here instead!
The move Helping Hand does wonderful things in\nDouble Battles!
You can buy Poké Balls and Potions from vending\nmachines around the Terarium.
Which Pokémon can I use a hunk of Metal Alloy\non...? Guess it’s gotta be a metallic one...
The dishes here taste super rich, but they give\nMeal Powers that help with all Pokémon types!\r\nIf you’ve got the BP, try ’em out!
The Canyon Biome’s the best for picnicking!\nIt feels nice just being in Amarys’s territory!
There’s no better place to enjoy a sandwich than\nthe Coastal Biome! Lacey’s plaza is there too!
You’ve got to clear the Elite Trials if you want\na shot at battling the Elite Four.
I can’t handle heights! No way can I do Amarys’s\nElite Trial!
I think Drayton’s my favorite of the Elite Four.\nHe’s so strong, even though he seems so lazy!
Crispin of the Elite Four... He’s kinda absent-\nminded, but that’s pretty cute!
Brrr. I’m still chilly from a jaunt in the Polar\nBiome. Better warm up with a slice of pizza!
Every dish here at the cafeteria is a personal\nfavorite of Director Cyrano’s!\c\nNone of them look very...balanced, nutritionally\nspeaking—but the Meal Powers are unbelievable!
My Tyrogue loves this treadmill!
Pikachu and I are doing our best to fight our way\nup the BB League!
The clubroom’s so flashy now. Meowth loves it!
Meowth has its claws out and looks eager to\nuse them!
Lacey must love the clubroom’s new fancy look!
Metang looks right at home when the clubroom’s\ndone up like this!
Man, the room looks cool this way! Way to go,\nArt Club!
W-wait, isn’t that the mysterious UFO?! Like,\nthe one from the movies?!
Some of the Pokémon hanging out in this room\nseem like the sort to make holes in things.\r\nI sure hope they don’t...
Blitzle blends right in with the room’s new black-\nand-white decor! It’s so cute!
Skarmory’s really tough—did you know that? It’s\ngot very few weaknesses.
You brought nature right to the clubroom! The\ngrass Pokémon look thrilled about it!
Thank you for veiling the clubroom in this\ndarkness. We’re grateful for the gloom.

These cardboard boxes sure are heavy for being\nso small. What could be inside?
This painting is entitled Street, Midday.\nIt depicts a beautiful town in a different region.
There’s a first aid kit, a plush toy, and more atop\nthe shelf. You can’t reach up there, though.
This room is just used for storage. You don’t need\nto go in.
It’s Skwovet’s bed! There are drool stains on it.
Lots of flowers are blooming in the backyard!
It’s the new fridge you bought when you moved.\nThere are sandwich ingredients in it!
It’s an induction stove. You should get your\nmom’s help if you’re going to use it.
The nice, big sink is kept sparkly clean.
This leads out toward the vegetable garden.\nBetter use the front door if you want to go out!
There are lots of fresh, juicy-looking fruits!
This painting is entitled Sibling Love.\nIt’s pretty charming!
This painting is entitled Gleaming Seas.\nIt’s gorgeous!
This painting is entitled The Hidden Ninja.\nIs it supposed to be of a Pokémon?
You can see the beach through the part in\nthe curtains!
It’s a cutting-edge refrigerator! But let’s not go\naround opening other people’s fridges.
The dishes in this cupboard are stacked\nincredibly neatly!
It’s a vending machine stocked with all kinds\nof snacks!

When Ryme was in her teens, her dear Puppy\nPokémon passed away, and she poured her grief\ninto a song. When she sang it, her partner came\nback to her as a ghost Pokémon. In that moment,\nthe rapper we know today was born.

Art: The Scenic Route
This month, we’re taking the scenic route over\nto Artazon to see Surrendering Sunflora by\nBrassius, the Verdant Virtuoso. This humble\ncolumnist wonders if ever a work has so aptly\ncaptured ennui and languor as this installation.
The sculptures are every bit as surreal as the title,\nprompting great minds to debate just what has\nsent these Sunflora into a state of surrender. But\nthough the meaning may elude us, the reader is\nurged to visit Artazon and see for themselves.

There’s a book entitled “Status Conditions and\nCatching Pokémon.” Do you want to read it?
Status Conditions and Catching Pokémon
Dealing damage to a wild Pokémon makes it\neasier to catch in a Poké Ball, and inflicting\nstatus conditions on the Pokémon can make it\neasier still.
Certain status conditions will provide even better\nodds of a successful catch than others. Putting a\nPokémon to sleep or freezing it, for example,\nmay yield better results than inflicting poison,\nparalysis, or a burn.
There’s a book entitled “Types and Moves I.”\nDo you want to read it?
Types and Moves I
You may be familiar with Pokémon that are\nGrass, Fire, or Water type. There are eighteen\nsuch types in all, and every Pokémon species has\nat least one type—some have two.
When Pokémon use a move that is the same type\nas they are, that move’s power is increased by\n50 percent. For Pokémon that have two types,\nmoves of either type will receive this increase.
There’s a book entitled “Types and Moves II.”\nDo you want to read it?
Types and Moves II
When Pokémon Terastallize, their type becomes\ntheir [VAR FF00(0006)]Tera Type[VAR FF00(0000)]. That means moves of their Tera\nType will have their power increased. Moves of\nthe Pokémon’s original type will keep their usual\npower increase as well.
For example, if a Pikachu—which is innately\nElectric type—has Steel as its Tera Type, then\nupon Terastallizing it would receive boosts in\npower for both the Steel-type move Iron Tail\nand the Electric-type move Thunderbolt.

Pokémon Natures
Individual Pokémon have different Natures, much\nas people do. You may be able to get an idea of\nyour Pokémon’s Natures if you watch how they\nbehave on picnics—whether they run around a\nlot or nap a lot, for example.
Pokémon’s Natures influence their stats to a\ndegree. For example, Pokémon with Adamant\nNatures tend to have their Attack stat grow\nstronger than it would otherwise, while their\nSp. Atk stat may suffer.

Fine Foods from Far Away
Have you chanced upon Pewter Crunchies, the\nfabled signature dish of the Kanto region’s\nPewter City? These snacks’ rugged, browned\nappearance makes them almost rock-like at\nfirst glance.
Indeed, Pewter Crunchies were inspired by the\nRock-type Pokémon for which the Pewter Gym is\nrenowned. Unfortunately, their forbiddingly\ntough appearance and surprisingly thin flavor\nhave kept them from attaining true popularity.

Charcadet’s Adventures
Charcadet, the Fire Child Pokémon, may have\nbeen little, but did that stop it from being a\nmighty hero? Not one bit! When a mean Gengar\ncame along to play tricks and scare people,\nCharcadet stood tall! “Raaah! Hi-YAH!” it cried!
But soon, brave little Charcadet got bound up\ntight in Gengar’s looong tongue! How could the\nFire Child Pokémon get out of this mess?\nJust as things started to grow hazy before\nCharcadet’s eyes, the sound of a voice came...
“Two paths lie before you, young Charcadet,”\nit said. “Choose between these two sets of armor\nand assume a new form so you can defeat\nGengar!” And sure enough, two sets of armor\nappeared before Charcadet... (To be continued)

An article caught your eye...
Enigmas of Paldea, File #09\nGreat Tusk: A Living Relic of the Dinosaur Era?!
In one arid corner of Paldea, there have been\nreports of a mysterious life-form. It’s said to\nresemble a Donphan at first glance, albeit one\nwith gigantic tusks, tough scales, and an\naggressive disposition.
Leading theories hold that this being is nothing\nless than a living relic of the dinosaur era, but\nno one can say for sure. Apparently, it’s called\nGreat Tusk after the name of a strange being that\nwas written about in the mysterious Scarlet Book.
Enigmas of Paldea, File #09\nIron Treads: An Alien Weapon?!
In one arid corner of Paldea, there have been\nreports of a mysterious life-form. It’s said to\nresemble a Donphan at first glance, albeit one\nthat can abruptly assume a spherical shape and\nlaunch into a swift rolling attack.
Rumors say this being is some kind of weapon\nusing technology not of this world, but no one\ncan say for sure. Apparently, it’s called Iron\nTreads after the name of a strange being that was\nwritten about in the mysterious Violet Book.
There’s a magazine entitled “Occulture.” It’s the\nOctober issue. Do you want to read it?
Enigmas of Paldea, File #10\nScream Tail: A Billion-Year-Old Jigglypuff?!
Somewhere in a Paldean forest, it’s said, lurks\nScream Tail—a being with Jigglypuff’s own\nendearing puffball appearance but also a\nferocious aggression that leads it to attack\nanyone who comes near.
Its primitive appearance and savage nature have\nprompted rumors that it could be a Jigglypuff\nfrom one billion years ago. It’s named after a\ncreature in the Scarlet Book that is described as\nhaving a distinctive tail and scream.
Enigmas of Paldea, File #10\nIron Bundle: An Ancient Civilization’s Robot?!
The mysterious Violet Book makes reference to a\nbeing called Iron Bundle, which was said to look\nlike Delibird and to possess a spherical apparatus\nfrom which it would fire huge blasts of ice to\npropel itself through snowy lands.
Plenty of theories about it have been floated. A\nleading one suggests it is the product of a long-\ngone civilization—a notion supported by ancient\nwritings that describe the design and usage of\nmachines resembling Iron Bundle.
There’s a magazine entitled “Occulture.” It’s the\nAugust issue. Do you want to read it?
Enigmas of Paldea, File #08\nSlither Wing: A Prehistoric Volcarona, Revived?!
There have been precious few sightings reported\nof the ultra-mysterious Slither Wing, a being\nwhose name is taken from that of a similar-\nseeming creature described in the ever-puzzling\nScarlet Book.
Slither Wing shares traits with Volcarona, so some\ntheorize that it may have been revived from\nfossils from a prehistoric era that we have\ndiscussed in these pages. However, no Volcarona\nfossils of that era are known to have been found.
Enigmas of Paldea, File #08\nIron Moth: A UFO Sent to Spy on Humankind?!
The name Iron Moth was borrowed from that of a\nflying object described in the era-defining Violet\nBook. It was said to resemble Volcarona and\nwould descend from the skies, following people\naround and occasionally even attacking them.
Some point to Iron Moth’s aggression as a sign\nthat it is, in fact, a UFO of sorts being controlled\nby alien life. Perhaps something out there is using\nIron Moth to observe us, waiting for the moment\nto mount an invasion...
There’s a magazine entitled “Occulture.” It’s the\nJuly issue. Do you want to read it?
Enigmas of Paldea, File #07\nSandy Shocks: A Magneton with a 10-Thousand-\nYear Lifespan?!
Some scientists claim that this mysterious being is\na Magneton that has lived for 10 thousand years.\nIt has been sighted numerous times in Paldea’s\nmore arid regions, but there are no reports of it\never having been caught.
It’s said that Sandy Shocks is an aggressive sort\nand that some people who’ve seen it have been\nattacked as well. It takes its name from a beast\nwith a matching description in the era-defining\nScarlet Book.
Enigmas of Paldea, File #07\nIron Jugulis: Pokémon or Machine?!
This flying life-form bearing a resemblance to\nHydreigon has been seen in a certain corner of\nPaldea. It was reported to have razed an entire\nbuilding with a high-energy blast, then flown off\nas if to find its next objective.
Iron Jugulis is theorized to be a sort of machine-\nHydreigon hybrid, as it combines the former’s\nruthlessness with the latter’s ferocity. It takes\nits name from a similarly described entity in\nthe Violet Book.
There’s a magazine entitled “Occulture.” It’s the\nJune issue. Do you want to read it?
Enigmas of Paldea, File #06\nBrute Bonnet: Amoonguss Meets Dinosaur?
This bizarre creature is said to combine traits of\ndinosaurs with those of the Pokémon Amoonguss.\nIt’s named after a fierce mushroom creature of\nmatching description that appears in the\nrenowned Scarlet Book.
Brute Bonnet certainly resembles Amoonguss,\nthough with its own unique twists: its gigantic\nstature and seemingly low intelligence combine\nto make it a savage, powerful fighter.
Enigmas of Paldea, File #06\nIron Thorns: A Tyranitar of the Distant Future?!
A strange being called Iron Thorns has been\nsighted in a certain cave in Paldea. This being\nbears a strong resemblance to Tyranitar, but it\napparently displays great coolheadedness and\nprefers to avoid unnecessary fights.
It appears to be highly intelligent and clad in\nmetallic armor, causing some to speculate that it\nmay be a Tyranitar as it would appear a billion\nyears from now. Its name comes from a similarly\ndescribed entity that appears in the Violet Book.
There’s a magazine entitled “Occulture.” It’s the\nMay issue. Do you want to read it?
Enigmas of Paldea, File #05\nFlutter Mane: A Ghostly Pterosaur?!
Flutter Mane—a name taken from a strange\ncreature with a matching description appearing in\nthe Scarlet Book—is said to float around the sky\nat night with its long hair writhing about it.
Eyewitness accounts describe it as resembling a\ngiant Misdreavus at first glance, albeit a highly\nfierce and aggressive one. Some believe that it’s\na ghost of a pterosaur from a long-gone era.
Enigmas of Paldea, File #05\nIron Hands: Secretly a Cyborg?!
This being’s name comes from the one given to\nan iron-handed entity in the mysterious Violet\nBook. It is said to have fists that move\nindependent of its body and to be capable of\nthrowing large, fast-moving vehicles.
A leading theory holds that Iron Hands was once\nan athlete who became mortally wounded but\nwas kept alive by being made into a cyborg.\nWhy it so strongly resembles Hariyama, however,\nremains unanswered.
There’s a magazine entitled “Occulture.” It’s the\nApril issue. Do you want to read it?
Enigmas of Paldea, File #04\nRoaring Moon: A Primeval Salamence?!
This elusive creature is called Roaring Moon after\na similarly described being in the Scarlet Book. It\nlooks similar to Salamence when they undergo a\ncertain phenomenon elsewhere in the world, but\nit’s unclear if there is any connection.
This creature scatters feathers as it flies around at\nhigh speeds seeking prey. It’s thought to be more\nsavage than Salamence, and if you should\nencounter one, it’s imperative that you avoid\nactual contact.
Enigmas of Paldea, File #04\nIron Valiant: An Experiment Gone Wrong?!
This oddity’s name is borrowed from that of an\nobject described in the Violet Book. One theory\nholds that it is in fact a robot—the product of a\nmad scientist’s efforts to create the most\npowerful psychic Pokémon of all.
According to its few eyewitnesses, Iron Valiant\nappears similar to both Gardevoir and Gallade.\nIt’s also said to be cruel enough to take its\nbrilliantly shining blade and cut down anyone\nconfronting it without hesitation.

We’ve determined that this energy crystallization\nis linked to the being we call ▉▉▉▉▉▉.\c\nThe interlocking hexagonal plates that comprise\n▉▉▉▉▉▉’s shell must somehow cause this\r\nphenomenon—which I’ve dubbed “Terastallizing.”
Thanks to my prototype Tera Orb, I secured\ncorporate funding for my research and made\r\na laboratory in the lighthouse near Cabo Poco.\c\nSomeday, though, I’ll return to the crater and\nresume my study of these crystals.
At last I can resume work on the Tera Project!\c\nI’ll move my research to the Zero Lab this month.\nMy team will be smaller, but no matter.\c\nThe strong influence of the crystals makes our\nexperiments much more unstable.
The crystals’ power is tremendous! Their unstable\noutput made our corporate backers fret, but...\c\nIf we can harness this energy, it will open up\nresearch possibilities we’d only dreamed of.\c\nAt last, paradise will be ours to create.

The Treasure and the Stellar Tera Type
The Area Zero Underdepths
Journal Entry
A massive cavern exists beneath Area Zero,\nand there slumbers Terapagos, [VAR FF00(0006)]the hidden[VAR FF00(0000)]\n[VAR FF00(0006)]treasure of Area Zero[VAR FF00(0000)]. Its body has become\ncrystal, protecting it from hostile outsiders.\nIt appears that rousing it will take some time.
In this cavern, I have witnessed the Terastal\nphenomenon occurring in a way I’ve never seen\naboveground—Terastallization that appears to\nhold the power of every known type. I have\ndubbed this Tera Type the [VAR FF00(0006)]Stellar[VAR FF00(0000)] type for now.\nCould Terapagos’s influence be at play?

I am calling the area found below Area Zero the\n[VAR FF00(0006)]Area Zero Underdepths[VAR FF00(0000)]. From the composition\nof the rock, I would date the cavern’s formation\nto two million years ago. There are indications\nthat many objects—or creatures perhaps—filled\nthe space prior to the current cavern’s formation.
The depths bottom out approximately 3,300\nfeet beneath the surface. There are indications\nof numerous past cave-ins, likely resulting from\ntectonic activity and erosion caused by rainwater\nor groundwater, but it appears that the ground\nhas remained stable since the last major cave-in.

While investigating the hidden treasure, I found\nmyself suddenly transported to a great height,\nnear a lake that smelled of sulfur. Based on\ntemperature and humidity, I believe it to have\nbeen the eastern lands I’ve read about before.\nAnd there, a child gave me a white volume...

You can’t catch it yet! You need to show Ogerpon\nmore of what you can do![VAR 0114(0044)]
I think that’s everything Ogerpon’s got! Now’s\nyour chance to catch it![VAR 0114(0044)]
It Terastallized its mask! So this is what Ogerpon’s\nreally capable of...[VAR 0114(0044)]
You made me wake up early for this, you know!\nYou’d better make it worth my time![VAR 0114(0044)]
Yeesh, you really hit where it hurts, don’t you?\nI bet you’re REAL popular back home![VAR 0114(0044)]
Ugh, that critical hit came out of nowhere!\nI coulda sworn it was gonna be a regular hit![VAR 0114(0044)]
Don’t blame me if Ogerpon changes its mind\nand wants to join up with me after this![VAR 0114(0044)]
Time to stir things up a bit. Better be on your\nguard, or else this move will getcha![VAR 0114(0044)]
Time to stir things up a bit. Better be on your\nguard, or else this move will getcha![VAR 0114(0044)]

Come on, Leafeon! Let’s take the ultimate shot![VAR 0114(0046)]
Kiii-kiii-shaaa!
Argh! What a time for my legs to give out, with\nthis great photo op right in front of me![VAR 0114(0046)]
Hey, are things heating up over there? Snap a\ncouple shots for me, would you![VAR 0114(0046)]
Wa-gaaaaaahhh!
This is great—I’m right up close to the action!\nKeep it going while I snap some shots![VAR 0114(0046)]
Oooh, that’s a new expression! This is wonderful!\nThere’s so much good stuff to capture![VAR 0114(0046)]
The Bloodmoon Beast is weak! Now’s your\nchance to catch it, partner![VAR 0114(0046)]
Memories of adventuring with you grant\nOgerpon strength!
Memories of working together to retrieve the\nmasks grant Ogerpon strength!
Memories of a partner from long, long ago\ngrant Ogerpon strength!
I suppose I’m representing Blueberry Academy in\nthis battle. I’ll try not to disappoint![VAR 0114(0049)]
Oh, would you look at that! You go right after\nthose type weaknesses with precision, don’t you?[VAR 0114(0049)]
That was quite the harsh blow! Let’s see...\nNow how should I turn this around...[VAR 0114(0049)]
Looks like my Plus-Minus strategy isn’t working.\nGuess it’s time to go all out with pure strength![VAR 0114(0049)]
Excadrill, sweetie! Let’s shake them to their core![VAR 0114(0049)]
I’ll give you a special treat since you came all\nthis way! Get ready to eat Terarium dirt![VAR 0114(0044)]
Hey, stop that! Why don’t you use one of those\nnot-very-effective moves sometimes?![VAR 0114(0044)]
There you go with the big hits! Maybe I should\nteach you a lesson or two in kindness, hm?[VAR 0114(0044)]
That’s it—I’m ready to go all out! Heh heh...\nTime for me to Tera it up![VAR 0114(0044)]
Go on, Sinistcha! Give ’em a nice blast of matcha\nfor me![VAR 0114(0044)]
Oh hey, Ogerpon! Aww, you must’ve really\nmissed me, huh?[VAR 0114(0044)]
Now then, time to get cooking—wait, no! Time to\nstart battling![VAR 0114(0047)]
Gwah! You’re really gonna douse our flames if\nyou keep using moves like that![VAR 0114(0047)]
Huh? Wait, what happened?! Where’d all that\ndamage come from?![VAR 0114(0047)]
Time to Terastallize and really turn up the heat!\nGo on, Blaziken! Burn bright red![VAR 0114(0047)]
Hope you’re hungry, ’cause Crispin’s flaming-hot\nspecial is coming right atcha![VAR 0114(0047)]
Get ready, Skarmory. You too, Dugtrio. We’re\nfinishing this battle right on schedule.[VAR 0114(0048)]
An unfavorable type matchup... You caught me\noff guard—now my glasses have fogged up.[VAR 0114(0048)]
So bad luck can also play a role in battles...\nThat’s good to know. Thank you.[VAR 0114(0048)]
...Time is short. Let’s wrap this battle up.[VAR 0114(0048)]
The more health a Pokémon has left, the more it\nwill suffer from this move. You’ve been warned.[VAR 0114(0048)]
This time I’ll be facing you with my usual party as\na member of the Elite Four.[VAR 0114(0049)]
It’s a rock-solid strategy to go after weaknesses...\nwhich is why I’ll be turning it right back on you![VAR 0114(0049)]
Why did you have to land that kind of hit?\nNow that’s just not right![VAR 0114(0049)]
All eyes on our great big Terastal heart! Time to\nget even cuter and cuter![VAR 0114(0049)]
Get ’em, Excadrill! Let’s send them flying with\nyour adorable destructive force![VAR 0114(0049)]
Don’t let me down, bud! No one wants to see me\nugly cry.[VAR 0114(004A)]
Whoa! Not a lot of types can make me eat a\nsupereffective hit.[VAR 0114(004A)]
Whew! That was beautiful. Seems like luck itself\nhas a soft spot for you![VAR 0114(004A)]
Now watch this dragon’s blood boil! Take control,\nArchaludon![VAR 0114(004A)]
Ready to get blasted to smithereens? I won’t\nleave you anywhere to run![VAR 0114(004A)]
I know I’m making the right choice... You’ll\nunderstand that soon enough![VAR 0114(0043)]
How do you like that? See how hard I’ve trained?\nNot like the kid you battled in Kitakami, huh?![VAR 0114(0043)]
Ack, wowzers... Doesn’t matter if the type\nmatchups work out for you, though—I’ll still win![VAR 0114(0043)]
Even luck’s chosen you over me... It’s not fair!\nIt’s JUST NOT FAIR!!![VAR 0114(0043)]
I don’t need the old me anymore! I’ve changed...\nand I’ll show you I can change again![VAR 0114(0043)]
Just go down already! How are you still standing\nafter I’ve thrown everything I have at you?![VAR 0114(0043)]
I’m capable of winning too, you know... Victory\nwill be mine and mine alone!!![VAR 0114(0043)]
You’ve got some nerve... Bringing out the ogre\nNOW of all times?![VAR 0114(0043)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Go, Terapagos! Show\n[VAR 0100(0000)]\r\nwhat\r\nyou’re\r\nmade of![VAR 0114(0043)]
Huh, it has a weakness? I thought this was the\nhidden treasure of Area Zero?![VAR 0114(0043)]
How can you get critical hits, even at a time like\nthis... What are you, the hero of this story?![VAR 0114(0043)]
Isn’t it amazing?! C’mon, hidden treasure, unleash\nyour full power for me!!![VAR 0114(0043)]
So this is the hidden treasure’s true form?!\nWith this...I can win for sure![VAR 0114(0043)]
Terapagos’s power should be far greater than\nthis. Could it be...we’re missing something?[VAR 0114(0042)]
[~ 1319]
[~ 1319]
Its energy output is going haywire! We’re all in\nserious danger if we can’t bring it under control![VAR 0114(0042)]
I’m sorry, kids, but please...you need to stop\nTerapagos![VAR 0114(0042)]
C’mon, Kiki, you need to do something too!\nWe’ve got to get Terapagos under control![VAR 0114(0044)]
N-no... This wasn’t supposed to happen... This is\nall my fault![VAR 0114(0043)]
It’s using a barrier to reduce damage?! In that\ncase, [VAR FF00(0006)]Terastallizing[VAR FF00(0000)] your Pokémon might help![VAR 0114(0042)]
Now’s your chance! Use Terastallized Pokémon to\nstrike back![VAR 0114(0042)]
Oh no, my Sinistcha’s knocked out! This isn’t\ngood... It’s just too strong![VAR 0114(0044)]
What? It absorbed Terastal energy?![VAR 0114(0042)]
I’m so sorry! All my Pokémon are knocked out![VAR 0114(0044)]
It put up another barrier of such strength?! Did\nit use the Terastal energy it absorbed to do so?[VAR 0114(0042)]
You need to get in there and battle, Kiki!\n[VAR 0100(0000)] is doing all the work![VAR 0114(0044)]
I—it’s no good! I’m useless...[VAR 0114(0043)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Now, [VAR 0100(0000)]! Terastallize\nyour\r\nPokémon\r\nso\r\nit\r\nshines\r\nonce\r\nmore![VAR 0114(0042)]
It absorbed Terastal energy yet again?! Surely it\ncan’t keep doing that over and over, though...[VAR 0114(0042)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Kiki! [VAR 0100(0000)]’s in trouble!\nYou\r\nneed\r\nto\r\nHELP\r\nH[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]IMER![VAR 0114(0044)]
B-but... I can’t... I can’t help anyone...[VAR 0114(0043)]
Come on, Kieran!
Let’s do it together!
O-OK! I’ll help out, too![VAR 0114(0043)]
Honestly... Better late than never, I guess! The\ntwo of you need to clean this whole mess up![VAR 0114(0044)]
It looks like it can’t absorb any more energy or\nput up another barrier! Time to attack![VAR 0114(0042)]
Time to end this, you two! You have my\npermission to go all out![VAR 0114(0044)]
Maybe it’ll go inside a ball now![VAR 0114(0043)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]You need to catch it, [VAR 0100(0000)]...\nIt\r\nhas\r\nto\r\nbe\r\nyou,\r\nnot me![VAR 0114(0043)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]I know I can count on you,\n[VAR 0100(0000)].\r\nYou\r\ngot this![VAR 0114(0043)]

Wh-what’s with them all of a sudden?! Why are\nthey attacking us?[VAR 0114(0043)]
I feel bad about it, but the only thing we can do\nis battle them until they calm down...[VAR 0114(0043)]
Mochi mochi!

Aw man, I can’t hold out much longer... Hurry up\nand finish it, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0043)]
Look—it’s slowing down! Now’s your chance!\nCatch it in a Poké Ball![VAR 0114(0043)]
GRAH! Pon PON!!!
Pechaaa! Chraaahhh!
My view count’s on the rise like a super-fast\nEelektross crawlin’ outta the ocean! Nyehehe![VAR 0114(0019)]
Come fooorth, shiny li’l lightbulb! No one buzzes\nas super-duper bright as you![VAR 0114(0019)]
Zap! Rock, paper, pew pew pew! Get ready to\nplay hide-and-go-BZZT![VAR 0114(0019)]
I become all the more beautiful when faced with\nadversity, you know.[VAR 0114(001C)]
They call me the Bewitching Beautician! No\nlooking away—not even for a second![VAR 0114(001C)]
Uh-oh. Is your posture slipping? We’ll straighten\nyou out...it’ll be très psy-chic![VAR 0114(001C)]
We’re near the endin’—feel the tension risin’?\nMake your peace now, ’cause you ain’t survivin’![VAR 0114(001B)]
Step to me, I’ll make you take a knee!\nToxtricity, drop the bass in a minor key![VAR 0114(001B)]
Check my Hex—I’ll vex all your careful plans!\nI’m death on two legs. You don’t stand a chance![VAR 0114(001B)]
It’d be way uncool if I wiped out without putting\nup a fight... I’ll dial up the effort a bit more.[VAR 0114(001A)]
Let the snow fall and pile up—let it obscure our\nweaknesses![VAR 0114(001A)]
Time for a chilling move. Don’t blame me if it\nfreezes you to your core![VAR 0114(001A)]
Good! Very avant-garde! Continue creating more\nart in this vein![VAR 0114(0017)]
Let us make hay while the sun shines! I dub this\nmasterpiece: “Truleewoodo Forever”![VAR 0114(0017)]
Time to pick up the pace! A Trainer like you\nought to be able to keep up—but will you?![VAR 0114(0017)]
Gahahaha! The tides o’ battle are fickle! Ya never\nknow how they’ll flow—and that’s what I like![VAR 0114(0018)]
Prepare the rigging for a big transformation!\nThe tide’s gonna flow my way now![VAR 0114(0018)]
The flow o’ water can crush boulders! Why don’t\nya see for yerself?![VAR 0114(0018)]
Grit and perseverance—that’s what Bug types are\nall about! We’re turning this battle on its head![VAR 0114(0016)]
Decoration time, my little Ursaring! Let’s get you\nsome antennae and bug you up![VAR 0114(0016)]
If you don’t do something about this next attack,\nI think you’ll be sorry! Hehe![VAR 0114(0016)]
I’ll see this battle through to the end...unless that\nmeans I have to work overtime.[VAR 0114(0015)]
There’s nothing wrong with plain and simple.\nLet’s keep things Normal.[VAR 0114(0015)]
Here’s a crucial skill for anyone in the workforce!\n...That sounds pretty bleak when I say it out loud.[VAR 0114(0015)]
You’re pressing me real hard, but I’ve still got\nthis—’cause I’ve got my loyal partner here![VAR 0114(0006)]
Mabosstiff, you know what’s coming! Shine as\nbright as anything, bud![VAR 0114(0006)]
Bite ’em to pieces with those sturdy molars! Time\nfor all that daily brushing to pay off![VAR 0114(0006)]
Oof, I’m in a bind here. I can’t believe I’m down\nto my last Veevee![VAR 0114(0008)]
Terastallize like the twinkling stars! You can be\nwhoever you want to be![VAR 0114(0008)]
Hope you’re ready for our starlit Veevee power!\nThis time it’s OUR turn for an all-out raid![VAR 0114(0008)]
I don’t give up so easy! I’ll put my spirit into this\nosu! Osu! Osu!!![VAR 0114(0024)]
Harness the power in those balled-up fists and\nget your blood running hot! Terastallize![VAR 0114(0024)]
Let’s go! Body ’em! Forget about defenses—go\nall offense![VAR 0114(0024)]
We aren’t defeated if our team’s value isn’t yet\nzero. Come on, partner. You’re my rock![VAR 0114(0025)]
I’ll multiply my Rock type by a Rock-type\nTerastallization! What will be the product?[VAR 0114(0025)]
Here we go, Garganacl. Let’s take them with a\nnice, acute Stone Edge![VAR 0114(0025)]
History is filled with betrayals. Don’t let your\nguard down—especially when all is going well.[VAR 0114(0027)]
I’m not particularly fond of all this high-tech stuff\nbut...do your thing, technology![VAR 0114(0027)]
Feel the power of a deeply held grudge! If I’m\nlucky, this will even lower your Sp. Def.[VAR 0114(0027)]
Ugh. I’m gonna lose! I can’t believe this![VAR 0114(0028)]
It’s your time to shine, my lovely Toxapex![VAR 0114(0028)]
Here’s your treatment, but you’re not gonna like\nit! Too much medicine is poisonous, after all![VAR 0114(0028)]
These muscles of mine will see me through!\nStand firm, Saguaro—you’ve got this.[VAR 0114(0029)]
We won’t lose this battle, and we won’t lose in\nloveliness, either. Hatterene, Terastallize![VAR 0114(0029)]
How about an enchanting kiss to drain your\nPokémon’s life-force away?[VAR 0114(0029)]
Boy, I sure am glad to see you haven’t changed.\nYou’re pushing my back up against the wall![VAR 0114(002A)]
Time to check some output levels! Here comes\nmy Tera Orb![VAR 0114(002A)]
Come on, Farigiraf! Let’s toss ’em around using\nsome telekinesis![VAR 0114(002A)]
Could this be the end of the line for me?\nMon dernier Pokémon! You’re my last hope![VAR 0114(0026)]
I’ll give you a little peek at dear Salvatore’s\nbrillantes capacités![VAR 0114(0026)]
Charge, Raichu! Let the lightning fall![VAR 0114(0026)]
Well, that stinks, but I’m still having fun! And\nwe’re only now getting to the best part![VAR 0114(0004)]
Shine blazingly bright, our greatest treasures![VAR 0114(0004)]
Get ready for a barrage of my hardest hits![VAR 0114(0004)]

To think you have grown this strong... But it’s\nnot over for me yet, you know.[VAR 0114(000A)]

A painting isn’t finished until the final brush\nstroke. Let’s complete our work together![VAR 0114(0012)]
It is time to don the crown of dragons! Let your\ncolor blot out all else![VAR 0114(0012)]
Pardon us for backing into you! Baxcalibur, use\nGlaive Rush![VAR 0114(0012)]
Hah! Ha ha ha ha ha ha! It’s not checkmate just\nyet, my friend![VAR 0114(0011)]

Witness the blinding light that shines down from\nhigh above![VAR 0114(0011)]
I like battlin’ you, kiddo. I can go all out without\nworrying about breakin’ you![VAR 0114(0013)]
Let’s have a little more fun! Go on, Clodsire!\nShake things up a bit![VAR 0114(0013)]
Hope you’ve braced yourself, kiddo—I’m about\nto rock your world![VAR 0114(0013)]
You haven’t won yet! I’m going to de-feet you,\nyou’ll see![VAR 0114(0014)]
It’s time to get dressed up all pretty and steely,\nTinkie![VAR 0114(0014)]
This move hits HARD! Hope you’re ready![VAR 0114(0014)]
Sooo, I’ve got... Ack! I’ve only got one Pokémon\nleft![VAR 0114(0047)]
Terastallize at high heat! Burn ’em and steam ’em,\nBlaziken![VAR 0114(0047)]
Have a mouthful of this spicy move! And don’t be\nsalty if you lose, eh?[VAR 0114(0047)]
I’m at a disadvantage...but my resolve to win\nremains firm. Let us proceed.[VAR 0114(0048)]
Countdown to Terastallization: 5...4...3...2...1...[VAR 0114(0048)]
Time to pile on the pressure. Don’t resent me for\nit—resent your Pokémon’s HP instead.[VAR 0114(0048)]
I don’t mind if you push me hard. I’ll push back\njust as hard to beat you![VAR 0114(0049)]
Here, have a great big Terastal heart! I’ll share\nthis cuteness with you![VAR 0114(0049)]
Do it, Excadrill! Captivate ’em with your super\ncute moves![VAR 0114(0049)]
That one stung real good, bud! The way it oughta\nsting in an all-out battle![VAR 0114(004A)]
Now watch this dragon’s blood boil! Show ’em\nwho’s in control![VAR 0114(004A)]
Can’t have that blood all boiled up for nothin’.\nGet ready for an onslaught—this won’t be pretty![VAR 0114(004A)]
Always pushing people into corners—I’m gonna\nwipe that smirk off your face, you’ll see![VAR 0114(0044)]
Don’t think you can steal the spotlight from me!\nTime for some Tera action![VAR 0114(0044)]
Don’t be shy—let me stir things up for you![VAR 0114(0044)]
Aw, man, that bites... But I’m still having a blast!\nTime to turn the tables![VAR 0114(0043)]
These feelings never change... And I’ll put them\nall into Terastallizing right here, right now![VAR 0114(0043)]

You’re better than I thought. This is starting to\nget interesting![VAR 0114(004B)]
Far be it from me to disappoint our audience.\nI think I’ll try something fun![VAR 0114(004B)]

The Paldea region has that one really big school,\nright?
Nothing says “festival” like a great big bowl of\nshaved ice!\c\nMy favorite flavor is Alola Blue. It’ll turn your\ntongue blue, though!

You are Katy, the owner of Patisserie Soapberry,\nare you not?[VAR 0114(0017)]
Yes, that’s me! And you must be Brassius from the\nArtazon Gym![VAR 0114(0016)]
The cakes and sweets that you craft with such\ncare—they are truly avant-garde![VAR 0114(0017)]
Would you consider, perhaps...a Grass-type\nPokémon for the motif of your next creation?[VAR 0114(0017)]
Oh, that might be interesting![VAR 0114(0016)]
How about a Sunflora? Its round face would work\nreally well on a cake![VAR 0114(0016)]
Oho! You have a true understanding of the arts!\nI cannot wait to collaborate with you on this![VAR 0114(0017)]
Oh? Mr. Kofu, did you put on some weight?[VAR 0114(0016)]
Gahaha! Can’t help it when I’m comin’ up with\nnew dishes![VAR 0114(0018)]
Ol’ man Kofu’s been makin’ plenty of deposits to\nthe belly bank![VAR 0114(0018)]
Well, I just hope you’re watching out for your\nhealth.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Your cute li’l Venonat wallet might get squished\nby your belly if you’re not careful![VAR 0114(0016)]
Gahaha! Thanks for that wallet, by the way! I’ve\nbeen puttin’ it to good use![VAR 0114(0018)]
My name is Katy, and I’m here to say, I like\nmaking pastries for people to eat![VAR 0114(0016)]
We patissiers bake fresh sweets and serve them\nall up in your face![VAR 0114(0016)]
Katy, baby...that ain’t rap. You’re just stringin’\nwords together.[VAR 0114(001B)]
Rap’s gotta rhyme, or else you’re just talkin’ over\na beat! You need to hit the rhyming dictionary![VAR 0114(001B)]
Aww... Rapping sure is hard! And why would\nI hit a poor dictionary? It didn’t do anything\r\nto me![VAR 0114(0016)]
I can’t even tell if you’re serious right now!\nIt’s kinda scary—and that’s me saying that![VAR 0114(001B)]
Say, Grusha, I have a question.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Huh? Wh-what do you want? Katy...right?[VAR 0114(001A)]
Do you happen to work out, Grusha?[VAR 0114(0016)]
Uh, yeah... Out of habit more than anything.\nWhy do you ask?[VAR 0114(001A)]
I see! Well then, when I’m giving you some nice\npastries, I’ll go for ones that are a little lighter on\r\nthe calories![VAR 0114(0016)]
Huh? Wh-why would you give me pastries?\nI mean, I appreciate it and all, but...[VAR 0114(001A)]
Hehe, sweets always put smiles on people’s\nfaces![VAR 0114(0016)]
Oh, I see... Right. Yeah. Well, thanks.[VAR 0114(001A)]
Oh, if it isn’t my favorite customer—Mr. Saguaro!\nI just adore that adorable apron of yours![VAR 0114(0016)]
Thank you, it’s my pride and joy! I spent a lot of\ntime getting Jigglypuff’s face just right...[VAR 0114(0029)]
Oh, and your arms are so big! You must be a\nfiend with a whisk![VAR 0114(0016)]
I, er... I’ve always put on muscle easily... Is this\ngoing somewhere?[VAR 0114(0029)]
Why don’t you come by Patisserie Soapberry\nsometime and put those muscles to use?\r\nEmployees get to eat the sweets for free![VAR 0114(0016)]
Free sweets, you say?! What a tantalizing\nproposition...[VAR 0114(0029)]
Alas, I have duties to attend to at the academy!\nGet it together, Saguaro! Don’t give in![VAR 0114(0029)]
I really like that one sweet you make, Katy. The\nTarountula-themed one...[VAR 0114(0028)]
Ah, the web macarons! They’re one of our more\npopular sweets at Patisserie Soapberry![VAR 0114(0016)]
They sure ARE! I’ve tried to snag some after\nwork, but they’re always sold out...[VAR 0114(0028)]
We’re getting some new hires next month, so\nwe’ll be able to make more! You should stop by![VAR 0114(0016)]
Huh?! For real?! Oh my gosh, that’s awesome![VAR 0114(0028)]
This is the best news ever! I’d better let Sagu\nknow, too![VAR 0114(0028)]
Pleeease, Brassius! Won’tcha come guest it up on\nmy stream?![VAR 0114(0019)]
My answer, naturally, is...no![VAR 0114(0017)]
Awww, c’monnn! Throw the Iono Zone a bone!\nWe Gym Leaders should all be friendos anyway![VAR 0114(0019)]
I have absolutely no interest in getting any\ncloser to you.[VAR 0114(0017)]
If you were a bit more avant-garde, the answer\nmight be different.[VAR 0114(0017)]
Look, I gotta ask—what does “avant-garde” even\nmean? It’s been buggin’ me forever.[VAR 0114(0019)]
The very fact you must ask shows how lacking in\navant-garde you are!\c\nYes, you lack that avant-garde...je ne sais quoi![VAR 0114(0017)]
Brassius, my boy! I see yer still scrawny as a twig!\nGahaha![VAR 0114(0018)]
Creating art is an arduous affair...[VAR 0114(0017)]
To create a true masterpiece requires sacrifice.\nIt is only natural that it would sap my strength.[VAR 0114(0017)]
I see, I see! But hear me out a bit...[VAR 0114(0018)]
If ya eat good, hearty meals, you’d have more\nenergy to give, am I right? I’m thinkin’ that’d help\r\nya make even more of those masterpieces![VAR 0114(0018)]
That...is a compelling argument![VAR 0114(0017)]
I recall you are quite gifted in the culinary arts.\nCould you perhaps make something for me?[VAR 0114(0017)]
Gahaha! Just sit tight, my boy! Ol’ man Kofu will\nget you sorted in no time![VAR 0114(0018)]
Hey, do you ever get scared that...like, y’know,\nall your talent will dry up some day?[VAR 0114(001A)]
Of course, I experienced such fear long ago! But\nnow, I am a stranger to fear altogether.[VAR 0114(0017)]
How’s that...?[VAR 0114(001A)]
I have faced my own death before. I perished\nonce—as an artist.[VAR 0114(0017)]
The fact that I still live feels like the greatest\nboon when I consider what I went through.[VAR 0114(0017)]
And no matter the setback I may face, it is little\nmore than a slight ache compared to that pain.[VAR 0114(0017)]
Hrrmph.[VAR 0114(001A)]
I suspected the same might be true for you,\nGrusha. Was I mistaken?[VAR 0114(0017)]
It’s kinda uncool of you to act like you know what\nI’m going through, old man...[VAR 0114(001A)]
Halt! That ancient relic you have there...[VAR 0114(0017)]
It appears to be a piece of significant historical\nimport...[VAR 0114(0017)]
Oh, you can tell, can you? Very perceptive.[VAR 0114(0027)]
Where did you get it? If that relic is what I\nthink it is, it should not be in your possession...[VAR 0114(0017)]
Ah, I just happened upon it a while back. And\nyou...I’ve seen your face. You’re an artist, no?[VAR 0114(0027)]
Indeed! And you have the bearing of a teacher—\nalbeit one uncharacteristically light-fingered...[VAR 0114(0017)]
Heh heh... I have no idea what you’re implying.[VAR 0114(0027)]
Ho ho... You cannot fool my keen eyes.[VAR 0114(0017)]
Thank you so much for your kind participation in\nmy class the other day![VAR 0114(0012)]
Well, it would be unimaginable to turn down a\nrequest from my dear ol’ Hass.[VAR 0114(0017)]
You know, I imagine you would make a fine\nteacher in your own right, Brassie.[VAR 0114(0012)]
No, never... These impressionable youths would\nbe too great a burden for me![VAR 0114(0017)]
Taking on the responsibility for such young,\nbudding lives... It is a weight I could not bear.[VAR 0114(0017)]
Indeed, being a teacher means shouldering the\nweight of that responsibility! I admit it’s not easy.[VAR 0114(0012)]
But that is why watching the growth of my\nstudents makes me cry tears of joy![VAR 0114(0012)]
Truly, you were born to be a teacher, my\ndear Hass.[VAR 0114(0017)]
Yo, Larry! How come you don’t face the camera\nin your Gym Leader pic?[VAR 0114(0019)]
I prefer to keep a low profile...[VAR 0114(0015)]
If people knew my face, I’d run the risk of\ndrawing crowds. That’d make it hard to get into\r\nrestaurants—or worse, I could get banned for\r\ncausing a disturbance in one.[VAR 0114(0015)]
Hwhaaa?! Hold up, back up! You DON’T want\npeople to recognize you?[VAR 0114(0019)]
Wait—that’s not even the bonkeriest part! How’d\nyou get the OK to do yours different?! Everyone\r\nelse has a regular pic![VAR 0114(0019)]
Oh, that’s just a matter of knowing who to talk to.\nIt comes with experience, I suppose...[VAR 0114(0015)]
Daaang. You’re adulting like a pro, Larry.[VAR 0114(0019)]
Nono, darling! Why haven’t I gotten an invite to\ncollab on your stream lately?[VAR 0114(001C)]
Gweh! W-well, to be super honest...[VAR 0114(0019)]
If people see you and me together...they’ll start\nnoticin’ all the ways you’re...better than me...[VAR 0114(0019)]
Don’t you talk about my friend that way! Your\nbeauty deserves to be shared![VAR 0114(001C)]
Aw, Tulip! Stop! I can’t even![VAR 0114(0019)]
Ideal beauty is always possible! It’s there, just\nwaiting to be realized![VAR 0114(001C)]
I’ll sign you up for a bunch of Emotional\nSpectrum Practices to get you started![VAR 0114(001C)]
Uh, Tulip? Stop! I can’t even![VAR 0114(0019)]
Iono of the Iono Zone, right?[VAR 0114(001A)]
Say whaaat?! Grusha, you know ’bout my\nstreams?![VAR 0114(0019)]
I used to watch them before competitions and\nstuff, yeah. Cheered me up a lot.[VAR 0114(001A)]
I’ve known about you since before you started\ndoing that weird greeting thing.[VAR 0114(001A)]
Holy geez! You’ve been on board basically since\nday one! I’m thrilled—and kinda embarrassed![VAR 0114(0019)]
I think I like your older content better, if I’m\nbeing honest. You took more risks, y’know?[VAR 0114(001A)]
Nowadays it feels like it’s all about gettin’ the\nmost clicks—all the sponsorships and everything.\r\nPretty uncool, if you ask me.[VAR 0114(001A)]
Ooof, you’re one of THOSE fans! This is why I\nquit reading the comments![VAR 0114(0019)]
I’m extremely sorry for causing you so much\ntrouble...[VAR 0114(0019)]
Oh, it’s quite all right. I rather enjoyed the\nwhole affair.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Still, if I’d known you were the distinguished\ndirector of Paldea’s prestigious academy, I’d\r\nnever have roped you into a livestream.[VAR 0114(0019)]
Let alone given you a silly nickname...that I\nrepeated...a lot...[VAR 0114(0019)]
Ah. You refer to Mr. Walksabout, I presume?[VAR 0114(000A)]
Erk. Y-yes. That one.[VAR 0114(0019)]
Well, I actually thought the name “Walksabout”\nwas rather charming and whimsical.\c\nI cannot deny it was an excellent moniker. You\nclearly have an aptitude for naming things.[VAR 0114(000A)]
P-please! Stop taking this so well! I’m gonna\nfaint from sheer embarrassment![VAR 0114(0019)]
Bonjour, mademoiselle Magnemite! How are you\ndoing this lovely day?![VAR 0114(0026)]
A friendo from another continento! ’Ello, ’ello,\nhola, ciao and bonjour! I’m from the Iono Zone![VAR 0114(0019)]
Waouh! It’s you! The one who says ce méli-mélo\nde mots—the famed user of this mishmash![VAR 0114(0026)]
What a chance this meeting is—en garde, Iono!\nJe m’appelle Salvatore. My name is Salvatore![VAR 0114(0026)]
“En garde?!” Sounds like you’re out to battle,\nMonsewer Salvatore![VAR 0114(0019)]
I’ll take you on. I just need a sec to set up my\nstream! Get me? I need time![VAR 0114(0019)]
Tyme?\c\nNon non, I’m not Ms. Tyme—though I’m flattered\nyou would mistake me for such a great beauty!\c\nHaha, je rigole! Just a little joke from me![VAR 0114(0026)]
Dude! Even I can’t keep up with whatever this bit\nis you’re doing![VAR 0114(0019)]
Larry! Just the foodie I wanted to see! I need\nyer input on somethin’![VAR 0114(0018)]
Uh, I’m not sure if I’d call myself a “foodie”...[VAR 0114(0015)]
I wanted to pick yer brains ’bout some ideas for\na new dish at my restaurant![VAR 0114(0018)]
...A new dish, you say?[VAR 0114(0015)]
I’d warn against anything gimmicky, since that\nwould only work in the short term.[VAR 0114(0015)]
Personally, I think you’d be better off maintaining\nthe high quality of the dishes you already have...[VAR 0114(0015)]
But if I must suggest something, I have noticed\nthat the Kofu Lounge lacks options for dessert.[VAR 0114(0015)]
Vaultin’ Veluza! Ya make a good point! That’s\nexactly the kinda idea I needed![VAR 0114(0018)]
You tried out that hot new pose I taught you,\nright, Kofy?[VAR 0114(001C)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]’Course I did! Me an’ [VAR 0100(0000)]\ntried\r\nit\r\nout\r\ntogether,\r\nin\r\nfact![VAR 0114(0018)]
Ooh! What a pair! I’d love to see how that pic\nturned out.[VAR 0114(001C)]
Lucky for you, I’ve got it on hand! Look at li’l ol’\nme there, almost fallin’ offa h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]iser hand...[VAR 0114(0018)]
Pffft! Hahaha! I didn’t think YOU’D be the one\nin that part of the pose, Kofu![VAR 0114(001C)]
Though honestly, I think it turned out even\nbetter this way...[VAR 0114(001C)]
Say, I know you... Yer one of them regulars at\nmy little restaurant, aren’t ya?[VAR 0114(0018)]
Oh my! Kofu from the Kofu Lounge, right?[VAR 0114(002A)]
Ol’ man Kofu, at yer service! ’Preciate yer\nbusiness, I do![VAR 0114(0018)]
Why, hello hello! The name’s Jacq.[VAR 0114(002A)]
I gotta say, it’s a pleasure watchin’ ya polish off\na big ol’ plate of my Dandan Noodles. You don’t\r\neven break a sweat![VAR 0114(0018)]
Aw shucks, you’re going to embarrass me, going\non like that. I just love spicy food, that’s all.[VAR 0114(002A)]
Sorry for always using up so much of that chili\nsauce you put out on the tables.[VAR 0114(002A)]
Vaultin’ Veluza! Ya add MORE spice to ’em?!\nWhat a catch! What a great catch![VAR 0114(0018)]
Please do pardon my forwardness, but...you\nhave quite an impressive physique.[VAR 0114(0029)]
Why, you don’t look too shabby yerself! You do\nsome kinda sport, or...?[VAR 0114(0018)]
I dabbled in wrestling during my school days.\nYou?[VAR 0114(0029)]
Vaultin’ Veluza! Wrestlin’, eh? I do a bit o’ sumo\nnow and then myself. Just as a hobby, y’see![VAR 0114(0018)]
Oh?! Sumo, you say?! Quite impressive![VAR 0114(0029)]
Oh, it’s nothin’. Gahahaha![VAR 0114(0018)]
With that physique, it’s no wonder... Hehehe![VAR 0114(0029)]
Thank you for doing business with us regarding\nthe redesign of the Montenevera battle court.[VAR 0114(0015)]
Oh, yeah! I forgot we hired you for that.\nNo sweat, baby. You did right by us too![VAR 0114(001B)]
That new battle court’s pitch-perfect for live\nshows and as ghostly as I wanted.[VAR 0114(001B)]
My sister loved her old rocky court, but my\nHoundstone couldn’t burrow into that![VAR 0114(001B)]
Ah, I see... To be honest, though, that project was\na huge boon to myself.[VAR 0114(0015)]
Without it, I would have landed zero contracts\nthat year.[VAR 0114(0015)]
Bahaha! Sure you’re not a Ghost-type user, Larry?\nSometimes seems like you’re barely stayin’ alive![VAR 0114(001B)]
C’mon, Larry! You gotta project more. Let’s start\nwith a simple enunciation exercise![VAR 0114(0013)]
UNIQUE UNOVA! YOU KNOW YOU NEED\nUNIQUE UNOVA![VAR 0114(0013)]
Unique Unova... You know you need unique\nUnova...[VAR 0114(0015)]
What was that?! It’s like you’re not even trying![VAR 0114(0013)]
Correct. I wasn’t trying.[VAR 0114(0015)]
Oooh, the nerve... I swear, you’re in for another\nlecture from Hassel.[VAR 0114(0013)]
So all I have to worry about is a scolding...? Let\nme know when my job’s at stake.[VAR 0114(0015)]
Uuugh! Hassel, you gotta come tag in for me! I’ve\nhad it with this guy![VAR 0114(0013)]
Mr. Laaarrrrrryyy![VAR 0114(0014)]
What can I do for you, Poppy?[VAR 0114(0015)]
Am I your best friend, Mr. Larry?[VAR 0114(0014)]
Errr...well...[VAR 0114(0015)]
Hm. I don’t think any answer is a good answer for\nthis question.[VAR 0114(0015)]
What was that, Mr. Larry?[VAR 0114(0014)]
Did you know, Poppy, that Komala spend their\nentire lives sleeping?[VAR 0114(0015)]
Heeey! Don’t change the subject![VAR 0114(0014)]
Indecisive grown-ups are the worst, you know![VAR 0114(0014)]
I got scolded anyway. I just can’t win...[VAR 0114(0015)]
Honestly, Larry! Always with the poor attitude! Is\nsome enthusiasm too much to ask for?![VAR 0114(0012)]
... ... ...[VAR 0114(0015)]
Larry? Larry! Are you even listening to me?![VAR 0114(0012)]
If I answer honestly, will it make you angrier?[VAR 0114(0015)]
...What do you mean?[VAR 0114(0012)]
Being honest is commendable! Why, it may help\ncalm me down rather than make me angrier.[VAR 0114(0012)]
Well, I was asleep just now, actually.[VAR 0114(0015)]
GRRRAAAGH![VAR 0114(0012)]
You seem to be enjoying this business trip, Larry.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Huh? Well, I suppose...[VAR 0114(0015)]
It’s...part of my job, after all.[VAR 0114(0015)]
I see... So you would happily travel anywhere, as\nlong as it was for your job?[VAR 0114(0011)]
What? No, that’s not—[VAR 0114(0015)]
As it just so happens, we’ve decided to send a\nPaldea League representative to a competition\r\nbeing held in a certain region.[VAR 0114(0011)]
I took the liberty of recommending you for the\nrole, Larry.[VAR 0114(0011)]
What did I do to deserve such a...lovely boss...[VAR 0114(0015)]
Y’know that weird sushi joint we got up in\nMontenevera? High Roller?[VAR 0114(001B)]
Yeah, I know the place. Never been, though.[VAR 0114(001A)]
Well, everyone I see go in there to eat comes\nout lookin’ like they got one foot in the grave.[VAR 0114(001B)]
Oof. Their sushi’s gotta be some kind of terrible\nif that’s the case.[VAR 0114(001A)]
You said it, baby! So how about we go check out\nexactly what kind of terrible it is?[VAR 0114(001B)]
I’ll be honest—I don’t get how you went from “it\nmust be terrible” to “we should go check it out.”[VAR 0114(001A)]
I gotta taste the fear, Grusha! Ain’t that what\nfear’s for?![VAR 0114(001B)]
Is that how it works...? Well, why not, I guess.\nLet’s check it out when I’m feeling up to it.[VAR 0114(001A)]
Hold up, lady. You’re big-time haunted! There’s a\nghost practically ridin’ piggyback on you![VAR 0114(001B)]
Is that so? I should have guessed. My shoulders\nhave been unusually stiff recently.[VAR 0114(0027)]
Baby, that spirit is vengeful like no other. What’d\nyou do to get hexed that hard?[VAR 0114(001B)]
Heh... If I had to guess...it probably happened\nwhen I snuck into that ancient tomb...[VAR 0114(0027)]
Oh, but don’t mind my ramblings. I tend to get\nhexed a lot. It’s an occupational hazard.[VAR 0114(0027)]
If you say so. I can go ahead and exorcise that\nectoplasm, but...maybe take it easy on those\r\njobs, all right?[VAR 0114(001B)]
Ryme! How are you, dear? Have you been\nwearing that cardigan I knitted for you?[VAR 0114(0025)]
Sis...you know I’m the MC of RIP, right?[VAR 0114(001B)]
You really think a beige cardigan goes with, you\nknow, my entire image?![VAR 0114(001B)]
Oh, where’s the harm! We’re both old ladies now.[VAR 0114(0025)]
And it’s awfully cold in Montenevera! Don’t you\nknow that the cold is a killer for the elderly?[VAR 0114(0025)]
OK! Fine! I’ll wear it when I’m off the clock![VAR 0114(001B)]
Oh, I’m so glad! You’ll have to send me a photo\nof yourself wearing it. Promise me![VAR 0114(0025)]
A Gym specializing in Double Battles...[VAR 0114(0011)]
I admit I had my concerns, at first. But I think now\nI must commend you, Ms. Ryme.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Your new approach has accomplished so much.\nMore than I can measure, in fact.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Hah! That’s a cute sentiment. But I gotta say...[VAR 0114(001B)]
Big talk when you won’t even darken my door!\nYou let a kid do your Gym inspection tour![VAR 0114(001B)]
I think it’s time we let the moves do the talkin’!\nFace me, or face Paldea and start walkin’![VAR 0114(001B)]
Oh my. I didn’t expect to be treated to a live\nrap performance from the MC of RIP herself.[VAR 0114(0011)]
That was amazing, indeed![VAR 0114(0011)]
Hmph! Never one to let yourself get pinned\ndown, huh? You’re shrewd, Geeta...and I dig it.[VAR 0114(001B)]
I only ever see you alongside the ever-dazzling\nGeeta... I’m just realizing how lovely YOU are![VAR 0114(001C)]
How would you like to model for my company?\nExclusively, of course![VAR 0114(001C)]
Ahhh, I knew this beauty of mine would catch\nsomeone’s eye sooner or later...[VAR 0114(0013)]
I can’t believe such a lovely canvas for my\nmakeup was right in front of me all this time![VAR 0114(001C)]
My third eye must be absolutely stuck shut!\nLet alone the other two![VAR 0114(001C)]
Er. I only see two eyes from where I’m standing.\c\nAnd sorry, but taking care of the boss is a\nfull-time job. I can’t take on anything else...[VAR 0114(0013)]
Well, darling, if you ever get tired of Geeta, my\ndoor’s always open.[VAR 0114(001C)]
When did you say I’d get to stop helping out\nthe Alfornada Gym?![VAR 0114(0024)]
Huh? I don’t remember saying you could stop...[VAR 0114(001C)]
What?! You can’t be serious![VAR 0114(0024)]
Well, we never really nailed down an end date,\ndid we?[VAR 0114(001C)]
Come on, Dendra... What kind of teacher goes\naround breaking their word? That’s a no-no![VAR 0114(001C)]
Grrr... But YOU’RE the one who never clarified\nan end date! Why are you making it sound like\r\nit’s my fault?![VAR 0114(0024)]
OK, I demand a rematch to re-decide the terms\nof this agreement![VAR 0114(0024)]
If you say so... But this time, if you lose, you’ve\ngot to do anything I say forever![VAR 0114(001C)]
Why do the stakes have to be so high for just\nme, Tulip?![VAR 0114(0024)]
I think I know who you are. You teach at the\nacademy back in Paldea, don’t you?[VAR 0114(001C)]
Y-yes, I do! But why do you know who I am,\nMs. Tulip?![VAR 0114(0028)]
Well, Dendra told me that one of her coworkers\nwas simply adorable.[VAR 0114(001C)]
She MUST have meant you, darling![VAR 0114(001C)]
Um, th-thank you?! I don’t know why you can\nbe so sure she was referring to me, but—[VAR 0114(0028)]
Wait, you know Dendra?![VAR 0114(0028)]
Well, obvs. We’ve been the tightest of tight since\nway back.[VAR 0114(001C)]
Really? I didn’t know that... I never get to talk\nabout this kind of thing with her, though. She’s\r\njust too...energetic for me, sometimes.[VAR 0114(0028)]
Yeah, she’s always been like that. It’s pretty cute,\nno?[VAR 0114(001C)]
I’ve been informed about your impressive work\nas the Alfornada Gym Leader, Ms. Tulip.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Oooh. Someone’s got an ear to the ground.[VAR 0114(001C)]
But anyway, yes—I’m a firm believer in not\nslacking on what needs doing.[VAR 0114(001C)]
How very admirable. Particularly since you are\nno doubt busy with your regular vocation.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Well, I think YOU would know all about being\nbusy, wouldn’t you, Geeta?[VAR 0114(001C)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]In fact, I was thinking—why not just keep\noutsourcing your Gym inspections to\r\n[VAR 0100(0000)]\r\nfrom\r\nnow on?\c\n[VAR 1100(00FF,0201)]HShe did a really excellent job of it.[VAR 0114(001C)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]To Champion [VAR 0100(0000)]? I would\nbe\r\nonly\r\ntoo\r\nhappy\r\nto\r\ndo so.[VAR 0114(0011)]
So, Ms. Rika—[VAR 0114(001A)]
Aw, don’t be stiff. Just call me Rika. Or maybe\n“good ol’ Rika” if you HAVE to be all respectful.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Uh, nah... That’s way uncool...[VAR 0114(001A)]
So, I wanted to ask you, Ms. Rika. Since you’re\nin the Pokémon League...[VAR 0114(001A)]
Uh-huh? Since good ol’ Rika’s in the Pokémon\nLeague...?[VAR 0114(0013)]
You know what? Never mind.[VAR 0114(001A)]
Nahaha! Sorry, sorry![VAR 0114(0013)]
Wow, mister! Are you a prince from somewhere?[VAR 0114(0014)]
Huh? Do you mean me...?[VAR 0114(001A)]
Yes, I do![VAR 0114(0014)]
Why are you hiding your mouth like that?[VAR 0114(0014)]
Oh, this? This is just to keep my neck warm...[VAR 0114(001A)]
I think you should pull it down so people can see\nyour whole face![VAR 0114(0014)]
Nah, it’s pretty chilly in here...[VAR 0114(001A)]
But I wanna see your whole faaaaaace![VAR 0114(0014)]
...OK. Fine. Just for a sec, though.[VAR 0114(001A)]
Oh wow! You really ARE a prince![VAR 0114(0014)]
Riiikaaa! I’m soooooo annoyed![VAR 0114(0014)]
Whoa, what’s going on? I don’t often see you so\nriled up, Poppy.[VAR 0114(0013)]
I came to Bloo-berry as part of our job! But\npeople keep mistaking me for some lost kid![VAR 0114(0014)]
Oh c’mon now, Poppy. You know that’s just\n’cause...[VAR 0114(0013)]
you’re so gosh-darn adorable![VAR 0114(0013)]
Huh? People think you’re lost if you’re adorable?[VAR 0114(0014)]
That they do, squirt! Haven’t you ever heard that\nold saying? “If you adore something, lose it”!\c\nAt least I think that’s how it goes. Pretty sure...[VAR 0114(0013)]
Ooooooh, I see! Wow, you’re real smart, Rika![VAR 0114(0014)]
So, what’s the haps?[VAR 0114(0013)]
Oh, I’m doing fine. I get along, pas à pas,\nstep by step.[VAR 0114(0026)]
Nahaha! That’s good to hear![VAR 0114(0013)]
And you? Comment vas-tu?[VAR 0114(0026)]
Ol’ Rika’s same as always—my energy’s super-\nhigh magnitude![VAR 0114(0013)]
Hahaha! I’m pas surpris—not surprised at all—\nto hear such high spirits from this old Rika![VAR 0114(0026)]
I know, right?\c\nSay, quick question... Who were you again?[VAR 0114(0013)]
Whenever I’m deeply moved, I can’t help\nmyself—the tears just flow like waterfalls![VAR 0114(0012)]
Aw, but that’s a good thing! It means you’ve got\na warm, caring heart... I think?[VAR 0114(0013)]
Ah, but I do waste so much time crying! If it\nweren’t for you, we’d never be able to finish\r\nany Elite Test![VAR 0114(0012)]
Oh, don’t worry about it! I love talking and\nkeeping things moving and all that![VAR 0114(0013)]
Is that so? I’m a little surprised—I’d have thought\nsuch duties would be painful for you.[VAR 0114(0012)]
After all, you are normally rather prone to\nclowning around...[VAR 0114(0012)]
Wait, clowning around...?[VAR 0114(0013)]
I’m the only member of the Elite Four that gets\nanything done![VAR 0114(0013)]
Grandpa Haaasselll![VAR 0114(0014)]
Hello there, Poppy. Are you working hard as a\ncoach?[VAR 0114(0012)]
Yes, I am![VAR 0114(0014)]
I know I’m still small, but I’m doing my very, very\nbest![VAR 0114(0014)]
Oh, I’m so proud of you, Poppy! You’re but a\nyoung child, and yet...[VAR 0114(0012)]
You’re—*sniffle*—worgig so hard...wid all de\nadults... Such dedigashun...[VAR 0114(0012)]
BWUUUH huh huh huh huh!\nHUUUUUUH huh hoi hoi hoi...[VAR 0114(0012)]
Oh no! Another one of your crying fits, Grandpa\nHassel?![VAR 0114(0014)]
There there, don’t cry. I’ll give you a hug![VAR 0114(0014)]
All your Pokémon are tough as steel, Amarys![VAR 0114(0014)]
That’s right. Steely as a Metagross.[VAR 0114(0048)]
Is that not true for you as well, Poppy?[VAR 0114(0048)]
It is! I’m a girl of steel, after all![VAR 0114(0014)]
Haha... Yes, your Tinkaton is indeed wonderful.[VAR 0114(0048)]
Yay! Your Skarmory’s also really tough! And your\nEmpoleon too![VAR 0114(0014)]
Wait—what’s a little girl doing here?![VAR 0114(0049)]
I’m Poppy! Nice to meet you![VAR 0114(0014)]
Oh! Um, yes, it’s very nice to meet you. You’re\nsuch a well-mannered child...[VAR 0114(0049)]
I’m an Elite Four member too! I’m here as part\nof my job![VAR 0114(0014)]
WHAT?! A-a child like you is...? But you’re...\nyou’re...you’re just TOO CUTE![VAR 0114(0049)]
Do you want some juice, Poppy? Or maybe a\ncookie? Do you like cookies?[VAR 0114(0049)]
I love cookies! I’ll gladly have some![VAR 0114(0014)]
You must remember that you are representing\nour storied academy at all times.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Do you really feel it is acceptable to do so\nlooking like you’ve just rolled out of bed?\c\nAnd good gracious, are those SANDALS you’re\nwearing?![VAR 0114(000A)]
Hehe, whoopsie. I promise I’ll remember to put\non something more professional next time...[VAR 0114(002A)]
I don’t think I’ve ever seen you wear anything\nthat could be described as “professional,” Jacq.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Do you even iron that lab coat of yours? From\nthe stains splattered across the fabric, could it\r\nbe that you don’t even launder—[VAR 0114(000A)]
C-come on, Director! Please! Have mercy![VAR 0114(002A)]
Traveled all the way here to keep an eye on me,\ndid you?[VAR 0114(0027)]
Ah. You seem displeased. Is my presence\ninconveniencing you in some way, Ms. Raifort?[VAR 0114(000A)]
Not at all. You know me—I’m only interested in\nbeing the best teacher I can be.[VAR 0114(0027)]
Well, that is certainly good to hear.[VAR 0114(000A)]
As long as I breathe, I will be sure that you\ncontinue to fulfill your duties as a teacher.\c\nA good, honest occupation—wouldn’t you agree,\nMs. Raifort?[VAR 0114(000A)]
Heh, wasting your time on me... You really take\nto interesting hobbies, don’t you, old man?[VAR 0114(0027)]
Though I admit I am fond of your way of thinking.\nIt’s charmingly...traditional.[VAR 0114(0027)]
Mr. Clavell, I must apologize again for what\nhappened the other day...[VAR 0114(0025)]
I was entirely in the wrong for failing to knock.\nYour office is your own private space, of course.[VAR 0114(0025)]
N-no, that’s quite all right. I truly am sorry to\nhave startled you with such an unbecoming scene.[VAR 0114(000A)]
No, please! I should have been more careful![VAR 0114(0025)]
Really, Ms. Tyme, I do not see it that way at all.\nThe blame for this incident lies squarely with me.[VAR 0114(000A)]
You’re sure? Well, if you are, I did have a few\nquestions about what I saw that day...[VAR 0114(0025)]
What were you doing dressed up in a student’s\nuniform, all alone in your office?\c\nAnd why were you wearing that wig?[VAR 0114(0025)]
A-ah, well, you see...it’s a rather long story...[VAR 0114(000A)]
Hello, Director! Osu! You sure are looking lively\ntoday![VAR 0114(0024)]
The same to you, Ms. Dendra. You seem\nsplendidly energetic as always.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Hahaha! Well...[VAR 0114(0024)]
Bein’ energetic is my thing![VAR 0114(0024)]
I see you have a clear understanding of your own\nstrengths—a valuable asset, indeed.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Please do share some of that overflowing energy\nwith the students of Blueberry Academy, too.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Osu![VAR 0114(0024)]
How are you finding life back at our academy\nsince your return, Miss Penny?[VAR 0114(000A)]
Huh? Like, in what way...?[VAR 0114(0008)]
Well, are you having any difficulties with your\nstudies or other school activities?[VAR 0114(000A)]
Uhhh... Studying’s never any trouble for me.[VAR 0114(0008)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]And I’m having fun hanging out with everyone in\nTeam Star, so that’s been great.\c\nOh! And I also got to go on a trip with\n[VAR 0100(0000)]\r\nand\r\nsome\r\nother\r\nfriends![VAR 0114(0008)]
Oho! It sounds like you’re enjoying your time at\nthe academy a great deal, then.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Ah. There is one thing—helping out at the\nPokémon League has been pretty tough.\c\nChairwoman Geeta literally terrifies me![VAR 0114(0008)]
She’s, like, SO intense. Even when she’s smiling!\nIs there any way you could help me out with her?[VAR 0114(0008)]
I’m afraid that’s...quite beyond my power.[VAR 0114(000A)]
You really are something, Ms. Raifort![VAR 0114(002A)]
I can’t believe you were able to figure out where\nthose Pokémon had been sealed away just from\r\nthose old writings you found![VAR 0114(002A)]
Heh... It proved to be simplicity itself, once I\nfollowed the clues of history.[VAR 0114(0027)]
But in the end, it turned out that a crook like\nmyself could never have opened the seals. So I\r\nlet a friend have the treasure.[VAR 0114(0027)]
So you formed a hypothesis based on clues, then\nput it to the test. I suppose history and biology\r\nare similar in that way.[VAR 0114(002A)]
Speaking of testing things... I was just considering\ntesting out the effects of a certain ancient ritual.[VAR 0114(0027)]
It just so happens that I need an adult male as a\nsacri—I mean, assistant. Care to help out?[VAR 0114(0027)]
I’d love to help! Count me in![VAR 0114(002A)]
Indeed, there’s nothing so difficult as knowing\nhow best to correct a student’s behavior...[VAR 0114(0025)]
Wait, even you struggle with it, Ms. Tyme?![VAR 0114(002A)]
Of course! There’s no teacher out there who\ntakes pleasure in having to scold a child.[VAR 0114(0025)]
But sometimes it must be done—even if it makes\nthe children hate you.\c\nIt’s our duty as the ones tasked with their\neducation and development.[VAR 0114(0025)]
I suppose...[VAR 0114(002A)]
Hmmm. I don’t really like doing it, but I guess\nI’ve got to do my best! Thank you, Ms. Tyme.[VAR 0114(002A)]
Don’t give up, Mr. Jacq! You can do it![VAR 0114(0025)]
Mr. Jacq! Mon sauveur! I still have not thanked\nyou enough for the help you did me and Pawmi![VAR 0114(0026)]
Wow, really? I’m glad to hear I was a help. And\nhow has your little Pawmi been doing since then?[VAR 0114(002A)]
Pawmi is doing très bien. Every day, it comes to\nmy classes together with me.[VAR 0114(0026)]
It’s still plutôt timide—quite shy!—but it has\nbegun to use its voice from time to time.[VAR 0114(0026)]
In fact, it’s created a bit of a stir among my\nstudents. They say that anyone who hears its cry\r\nwill have the greatest of luck![VAR 0114(0026)]
Amazing! Sounds like Pawmi’s become quite\nthe star![VAR 0114(002A)]
Thank you for always patching me up when I\ntake a tumble, Nurse Miriam...[VAR 0114(002A)]
Oh, it’s no big deal![VAR 0114(0028)]
I mean, it’s not like I’m just gonna stand there\nwhen you take a fall like that right in front of me.[VAR 0114(0028)]
Haha... I guess not.[VAR 0114(002A)]
But honestly...you really oughta be more careful,\nMr. Jacq![VAR 0114(0028)]
I think the only person who gets more scraped\nup than you is Dendra...[VAR 0114(0028)]
Oooh! You mean when it comes to injuries, I’m in\nsecond place?![VAR 0114(002A)]
I guess I’ll need to work hard to reach the top!\nRight, Nurse Miriam?[VAR 0114(002A)]
If you’re gonna crack jokes about it, you can get\nscuffed up for all I care! Be serious![VAR 0114(0028)]
Yes, ma’am...[VAR 0114(002A)]
Ms. Raifort, will you be attending next week’s\nstaff meeting?[VAR 0114(0025)]
Put me down as absent, please.[VAR 0114(0027)]
I’d much rather spend my time contemplating\nancient wisdom.[VAR 0114(0027)]
Oh, how sad to hear. We do always miss your\npresence at our meetings...[VAR 0114(0025)]
I’d love for you to come and give us all a nice\nlong talk about history.[VAR 0114(0025)]
Oh? So you are interested in history?[VAR 0114(0027)]
Heh... My dear lady, I misjudged you. You may\nbe worth my time, after all.[VAR 0114(0027)]
Perhaps it would not be amiss for me to converse\nwith my elders from time to time...[VAR 0114(0027)]
Oh, wonderful! Then I’ll be sure to mark you\ndown as attending![VAR 0114(0025)]
You seem unusually tired today, Ms. Raifort.[VAR 0114(0029)]
Is it that obvious? I was hoping nobody would\nnotice... Heh...[VAR 0114(0027)]
Don’t fret about me. I was simply up late last\nnight doing research.[VAR 0114(0027)]
I was reading my way through a stack of 20 or so\nhistory books in the academy entrance hall, and\r\nwhen I looked up, it was suddenly morning.[VAR 0114(0027)]
Oho... You’re quite devoted to your work.[VAR 0114(0029)]
I imagine you’ve spent many a night like that,\ncultivating the knowledge to guide your students.[VAR 0114(0029)]
What are you going on about? It’s my hobby.\nNothing to do with my work at all.[VAR 0114(0027)]
... ... ...[VAR 0114(0029)]
And now why are you silent, all of a sudden?[VAR 0114(0027)]
Nurse Miriam, I haven’t had the chance to offer\nmy congratulations on your certification![VAR 0114(0025)]
Oh, thank you so, so, so much, Ms. Tyme![VAR 0114(0028)]
Will you start teaching classes next school year?\nEveryone is looking forward to it![VAR 0114(0025)]
Yes, I will! I’ll try my best not to cause the rest\nof the teachers any trouble![VAR 0114(0028)]
Oh, goodness, how sweet! You’ll be the angel of\nthe entire academy, not just the nurse’s office![VAR 0114(0025)]
Don’t you start with that “angel” stuff, too,\nMs. Tyme! You’re not safe from my wrath![VAR 0114(0028)]
Penny, dear! You were the only one to get a\nperfect score on our last test![VAR 0114(0025)]
Huh? Oh. Cool...[VAR 0114(0008)]
I mean...it wasn’t all that hard.[VAR 0114(0008)]
I even added some trick questions, but they didn’t\ncatch you for a moment. It’s very impressive.[VAR 0114(0025)]
Actually, it’s pretty easy to tell which of your\nquestions are the trick ones...[VAR 0114(0008)]
Some of the other teachers, well...they make tests\nwith trick questions that are flat-out mean.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Oh! So that means you think I’m nice, then?\nWell, I’m delighted to hear it![VAR 0114(0025)]
Huh? Errr. I...guess?[VAR 0114(0008)]
I mean, well, you’re not one of my least favorite\nteachers...[VAR 0114(0008)]
I adore you as well, my dear![VAR 0114(0025)]
Bonjour, Ms. Dendra! You seem to be in high\nspirits as usual![VAR 0114(0026)]
Osu, Mr. Salvatore![VAR 0114(0024)]
You know what? I had a question for you, in fact.\nSi je peux?[VAR 0114(0026)]
I’ve long wondered about the definition of that\nword you always say—“Osu”![VAR 0114(0026)]
The definition...of osu?![VAR 0114(0024)]
It’s a bit hard to explain, actually...[VAR 0114(0024)]
It seems to be something like a greeting you can\nuse à tout moment—anytime, day or night.\r\nIs that not so?[VAR 0114(0026)]
Now that you mention it, it is used a lot as a\ngreeting, but...[VAR 0114(0024)]
It hypes you up! That’s the word I was looking\nfor! It fills you with fighting spirit![VAR 0114(0024)]
Splendid... So it fills you with the fighting spirit.\nL’esprit combatif... Could I also partake in it?[VAR 0114(0026)]
Yeah, let’s osu it up! Smash through your limits![VAR 0114(0024)]
Then I will join you! Osu![VAR 0114(0026)]
What’s your wife like, Salvatore?[VAR 0114(0028)]
Oh! Nurse Miriam! You’re curious about ma\nfemme—my dear wife?[VAR 0114(0026)]
Of course! Don’t you know that all the students\nare gossiping about what she might be like?[VAR 0114(0028)]
Ma femme has eyes so big and round! And\ncheeks so lovely and soft![VAR 0114(0026)]
Uh-huh, uh-huh! What about her personality?[VAR 0114(0028)]
Well, she is a little shy, but she is always clinging\nto my legs so adorably.[VAR 0114(0026)]
Clinging...to your legs? What do you...?[VAR 0114(0028)]
Oops, that’s not my wife I’m describing—that’s\njust Pawmi! Hahaha! Funny, no?[VAR 0114(0026)]
Your wife must be nice if she’s willing to go along\nwith these antics...[VAR 0114(0028)]
Mr. Salvatore! I didn’t realize you were here too![VAR 0114(0006)]
Waouh! My dear Arven! Did you come all this\nway just to meet me?[VAR 0114(0026)]
Oh, uh, no... Not really...[VAR 0114(0006)]
But since you’re here and all, can you help me\nwith some of my homework?![VAR 0114(0006)]
Bien sûr! Of course I will![VAR 0114(0026)]
I’ve noticed that you are much more passionné—\nthat is, passionate—about your studies lately.\r\nIs there some cause for the sudden change?[VAR 0114(0026)]
Yeah...I guess you could say that![VAR 0114(0006)]
I’ve got friends now that I wanna be on the same\nlevel with. I don’t wanna be dragging them down![VAR 0114(0006)]
The same level? Oh, like in les jeux vidéo—\nthe video games! These are friends you play les\r\nvideo games with, non? How nice for you![VAR 0114(0026)]
Ah, man... I don’t think we’re understanding one\nanother here, are we?[VAR 0114(0006)]
I trust that your culinary training has been going\nswimmingly since we last spoke?[VAR 0114(0029)]
Actually, I reached my goal, so I’m taking a break\nfrom my training![VAR 0114(0024)]
Oh, is that so? In that case all is well, I suppose...[VAR 0114(0029)]
If you ever need assistance in your culinary\npursuits, I’m just a shout away.[VAR 0114(0029)]
Just let me know when you are ready to begin\nyour training again.[VAR 0114(0029)]
You’ll help me train?! You sure?! Well, no time\nlike the present—let’s get started![VAR 0114(0024)]
I wanna do some squats but need some extra\nweight! Why don’tcha get on my back?![VAR 0114(0024)]
Have you been listening to anything I’ve been\nsaying?![VAR 0114(0029)]
Thanks for that sandwich you made me, by\nthe way.[VAR 0114(0028)]
It was all right, I guess? Not too bad.[VAR 0114(0028)]
Really?! Yesss! I’m so happy you enjoyed my\ncooking![VAR 0114(0024)]
It must have been real tasty, seeing how you were\ncrying tears of joy and everything![VAR 0114(0024)]
I wasn’t THAT happy! Pump the brakes a little,\nDendra![VAR 0114(0028)]
So...when’s the next...uh, “meal”?[VAR 0114(0028)]
Huh?! Well, I mean, I’m done with my sandwich\ntraining now...[VAR 0114(0024)]
Huh? Done? Just like that?[VAR 0114(0028)]
Do you...maybe wanna make some sandwiches\ntogether sometime?[VAR 0114(0028)]
No way! Miriam’s handmade sandwiches?![VAR 0114(0024)]
I’m so pumped! I’m gonna work up an appetite\nstarting now![VAR 0114(0024)]
We’re making them TOGETHER! You better do\nyour part too, Dendra![VAR 0114(0028)]
Hey, Ms. Dendra! I really wanna get stronger.\nCan you help me?[VAR 0114(0004)]
Even stronger than you are now?! Haha, typical\nNemona![VAR 0114(0024)]
As long as you keep that attitude, you’ll get\nstronger for sure![VAR 0114(0024)]
Heh. Thanks for saying so![VAR 0114(0004)]
So, I know you taught us three main points:\na well-balanced party, moves for every scenario,\r\nand knowing when to Terastallize!\c\nWhat else should I be looking out for?![VAR 0114(0004)]
There’s one more thing... Hot-blooded power![VAR 0114(0024)]
Power? And it’s hot-blooded? Whoa![VAR 0114(0004)]
That power will come in real clutch when you’re\nup against the ropes![VAR 0114(0024)]
I think I get it![VAR 0114(0004)]
Train up that hot-blooded power, and obliterate\nyour limits! Osu!!![VAR 0114(0024)]
Heck yeah! Osu!!![VAR 0114(0004)]
Hassel... Is there anything troubling you regarding\nthe day-to-day operations of the League?[VAR 0114(0011)]
Anything troubling me?[VAR 0114(0012)]
Hmm, well... The bell that tells us when it’s time\nto enter the Elite Test room has been broken for\r\na while. It would be nice to get that fixed.[VAR 0114(0012)]
Ah, yes... It’s been several months since it broke\nnow, hasn’t it? I apologize for the inconvenience.[VAR 0114(0011)]
I have already contacted the repair crew, but\ntheir schedule is unfortunately completely full...[VAR 0114(0011)]
I suppose everyone is very busy nowadays.[VAR 0114(0012)]
It’s not a high priority, to be honest. We just\nshout to the next Elite Four member when it’s\r\ntheir turn to battle. It’s just that—[VAR 0114(0012)]
Say no more, Hassel.[VAR 0114(0011)]
The problem is Larry, correct?[VAR 0114(0011)]
Hey, Mr. Hassel! Did I tell you I’ve been training\na Kommo-o?[VAR 0114(0004)]
Ah, the Scaly Pokémon Kommo-o! A unique\ndragon indeed![VAR 0114(0012)]
Yeah! I met it in Kitakami—and it’s awesome!\nI wanna try all kinds of strats with it![VAR 0114(0004)]
Then allow me to offer some advice!!![VAR 0114(0012)]
You must utilize its sturdy defenses and use\nClangorous Soul the first chance you get![VAR 0114(0012)]
Accomplish that, and the scaly dragon will\nindeed become your key to victory![VAR 0114(0012)]
All right! I LOVE victory![VAR 0114(0004)]
I’ve been thinking a lot about what other moves\nto teach it! Can I run ’em by you?[VAR 0114(0004)]
I would be more than happy to offer my input.[VAR 0114(0012)]
Why, if it isn’t young Drayton! I didn’t know you\nwere a member of this club.[VAR 0114(0012)]
Gwuh! Mr. Hassel?![VAR 0114(004A)]
Your grandfather Drayden informed me that\nyou were forced to repeat a year of school...\r\nSeveral years, in fact![VAR 0114(0012)]
Yeesh. Thanks for letting the whole world know,\nGrandpa...[VAR 0114(004A)]
Fine, so I got held back a couple times! It is what\nit is, all right?[VAR 0114(004A)]
Doesn’t life have room for taking a stroll on the\nscenic path sometimes?[VAR 0114(004A)]
Indeed. But studying is also an excellent way to\nbroaden said path, is it not?[VAR 0114(0012)]
I am not suggesting you should desperately try\nto live up to the expectations of others.[VAR 0114(0012)]
I simply hope that you spend your days as a\nstudent in a way that you do not regret later on.[VAR 0114(0012)]
*sigh*\nI get it, Mr. Hassel, I get it. Please just give it a\r\nrest already.[VAR 0114(004A)]
Pssst, Sagu, did you try the...y’know...?[VAR 0114(0028)]
Are you referring to Kanto Crepes’ limited-time\ndish, the banana deluxe crepe?[VAR 0114(0029)]
Yeah! But wait... Are you OK discussing it out in\nthe open like this? What if someone hears?[VAR 0114(0028)]
A certain student urged me to no longer be so\nhush-hush about my love for sweets.[VAR 0114(0029)]
I’ve decided to embrace my sweet tooth! I will\nno longer be ashamed![VAR 0114(0029)]
Oh, that’s great![VAR 0114(0028)]
So that means the next time we go on a sweets\ntour, you don’t need to go out in disguise![VAR 0114(0028)]
Indeed! I’m free to enjoy fine sweets in my\nregular attire![VAR 0114(0029)]
I don’t think the disguise did much anyway...\nNot too many people are built like you.[VAR 0114(0028)]
Arven, my boy, how’s it going with that dish\nyou’ve been working on?[VAR 0114(0029)]
I think it’s really coming along, thanks to some\nhelp from [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0006)]
I’ve been able to make some real standout\nsandwiches, thanks to all your lessons![VAR 0114(0006)]
Splendid. I’m happy to hear it.[VAR 0114(0029)]
Y’know, that stuff you taught in class was really\ntrue.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Hm? What are you referring to?[VAR 0114(0029)]
Like, how making food is better when you do it\nwith someone, and all that.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Digging in with my best buds makes food taste\nso much better than eating alone![VAR 0114(0006)]
Hola, Primera! You sure shook up your\nparty, huh?[VAR 0114(0004)]
Well, of course. I am La Primera, after all.\c\nHow could I set an example for other Trainers if I\ndon’t keep pushing myself to become stronger?[VAR 0114(0011)]
That checks out! I better keep up the pace, too![VAR 0114(0004)]
Well, I don’t plan on slowing down until I hand\nover the role of Top Champion to you...or indeed\r\nto Champion [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0011)]
Nooo! C’mon, Primera, don’t talk about that![VAR 0114(0004)]
I’d rather you just stayed Primera forever![VAR 0114(0004)]
Hah... If that’s the case, it seems I won’t be able\nto retire for a good while yet.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Why hello there, Penny. I didn’t realize you were\nhere.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Ch-Chairwoman Geeta?![VAR 0114(0008)]
Are you here to study and analyze this academy’s\nBP system?[VAR 0114(0011)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Uh, no... [VAR 0100(0000)] invited me,\nso\r\nI\r\njust\r\ndropped\r\nby\r\nto\r\nhang out...[VAR 0114(0008)]
Oh, is that so? My, my...[VAR 0114(0011)]
... ... ...[VAR 0114(0008)]
... ... ...[VAR 0114(0011)]
I am very glad to hear that. It seems you are\nindeed treasuring your friends, as you should.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Ohmygosh, my heart literally stopped! I thought\nI was in trouble for sure![VAR 0114(0008)]
Please—you gotta stop with the ominous pauses!\nMy poor heart can’t take it![VAR 0114(0008)]
I’m pleased to meet you properly.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Drayton—progeny of a long line of Dragon-type\nusers, if I’m not mistaken.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Hang on. Pretty sure I never mentioned that\nto you.[VAR 0114(004A)]
Ah, I beg your pardon.[VAR 0114(0011)]
But I am curious... What do you see yourself\ndoing in the future, Drayton?[VAR 0114(0011)]
I doubt I’m the guy you want to ask about future\nstuff.[VAR 0114(004A)]
All I really care about is enjoying the here\nand now.[VAR 0114(004A)]
So if you’re scouting out new League members,\nyou may wanna bark up another tree.[VAR 0114(004A)]
You see through my intentions, apparently.[VAR 0114(0011)]
I suppose your free-spirited nature is part of\nwhat makes you so strong.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Aaarveeen! Did I hear right that a certain floppy-\nhaired pal of mine started taking on Gyms?![VAR 0114(0004)]
Gah! You’re the last person I wanted to find\nout about that![VAR 0114(0006)]
But...well, yeah! Figured I’d start small and try\none now and then, in between school and all.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Niiice! That’s a perfect first step on your path to\nbecoming Champion Arven![VAR 0114(0004)]
No way! There’s no way I’m taking it that far![VAR 0114(0006)]
It’s just, like...I dunno. I want to be able to stand\nbeside my best bud and feel like I belong there.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Oh, whoa! OK, I get it, I get it![VAR 0114(0004)]
So what I’m hearing is we should battle for the\nright to be [VAR 0100(0000)]’s rival![VAR 0114(0004)]
See?! This is why I didn’t want you to find out!\nI knew you’d be like this, you battle maniac![VAR 0114(0006)]
So, Penny, which do you like better—our academy\nback home or Blueberry Academy?[VAR 0114(0004)]
Hmm. Well, they both get minus points since\nschools aren’t my happy place...[VAR 0114(0008)]
But if I had to pick, all the battle-obsessed\nstudents here make it feel way too intense,\r\nso our academy back home gets my vote![VAR 0114(0008)]
Aw, what’s wrong with a little battle obsession?\nIt’s fun![VAR 0114(0004)]
So you prefer Blueberry Academy, then?[VAR 0114(0008)]
Whoof. That’s a tough call...[VAR 0114(0004)]
But I think I gotta give it to our academy back\nhome, too![VAR 0114(0004)]
Ooh. How come?[VAR 0114(0008)]
Well, we’ve got our battle studies course, and\nour teachers are super nice![VAR 0114(0004)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]And I’d never have met you and\n[VAR 0100(0000)]\r\nif\r\nwe\r\nhadn’t\r\nenrolled\r\nthere, too![VAR 0114(0004)]
Huh... Yeah. Can’t argue with that.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Oh, Nemona! It’s been far too long! I don’t think\nwe’ve met since that party, have we?[VAR 0114(0049)]
Whoooa! Lacey, right?! Good to see you![VAR 0114(0004)]
I can’t believe you remembered my name from\njust that one time we met! That’s awesome![VAR 0114(0004)]
Oh, no, it’s no more impressive than you\nremembering my name in return! And besides,\r\nhow could I forget you![VAR 0114(0049)]
You created such a stir, challenging my daddy to\na battle right there in your fancy party dress![VAR 0114(0049)]
Yeah, I’m really sorry about that. Once I heard he\nwas a Gym Leader, I just couldn’t help myself...[VAR 0114(0004)]
But Daddy was so pleased with you![VAR 0114(0004)]
Do you know what he said? “Nothin’ wrong with\na young missy who knows what she wants!” Hehe![VAR 0114(0049)]
Haha! Aww, I’m glad! Clay’s very kind![VAR 0114(0004)]
Hey, Nemona, how’d you get so strong?[VAR 0114(0044)]
Awww! You called me strong! Thanks, Carmine![VAR 0114(0004)]
Wha—? No, I wasn’t complimenting you. I was\nasking you a question! What’s your secret?[VAR 0114(0044)]
My secret? Hmm... My secret...[VAR 0114(0004)]
I guess working really hard and training my\nPokémon really hard![VAR 0114(0004)]
Oh come on, I already do all that![VAR 0114(0044)]
Sheesh, all I wanted was to get real strong real\nfast and surprise [VAR 0100(0000)]...\c\nGuess it’s not that easy.[VAR 0114(0044)]
Oooh, I dig the idea, though! Why don’t you and\nI do some training together![VAR 0114(0004)]
Sure, but you’re way too strong, so...y’know...[VAR 0114(0044)]
Say no more—I know exactly what you want!\nMax power mode! The gloves are comin’ off![VAR 0114(0004)]
That’s not what I was asking at all![VAR 0114(0044)]
Man, Kieran, I can’t believe how fast you blasted\nyour way through the BB League and became\r\nChampion![VAR 0114(0004)]
Um, yeah...[VAR 0114(0043)]
But it turns out I’m just no good...[VAR 0114(0043)]
Whaaat?! What makes you say that?[VAR 0114(0004)]
I only thought about winning back then.[VAR 0114(0043)]
I trained and trained so much every day... I barely\nslept, and I hardly even ate.[VAR 0114(0043)]
I did all that and finally made it to Champion,\nbut in the end, I just got crushed anyway.[VAR 0114(0043)]
I dunno about that, but I do know that it’s\nawesome how dedicated you can be![VAR 0114(0004)]
It must mean you really love Pokémon, Kieran![VAR 0114(0004)]
Huh... I guess I do like them. And that’s why\nI worked so hard...[VAR 0114(0043)]
I feel a bit better about it now. Thanks, Nemona.[VAR 0114(0043)]
Aw, don’t worry about it![VAR 0114(0004)]
You’re eating your vegetables, right?! Don’t\nmake me tell you again![VAR 0114(0006)]
Ehh. It’s not like I’ll die if I don’t eat them, so\nwhat’s the point?[VAR 0114(0008)]
Seriously? Penny, you do know that you NEED to\neat veggies, right? Like—seriously?![VAR 0114(0006)]
...You’re being weirdly insistent about this.\nWhat’s the worst that could happen?[VAR 0114(0008)]
Your body could get all...mushy and stuff! Till you\nmight seriously die! I’ve read about it in books![VAR 0114(0006)]
Wait, what? Seriously?! I’m gonna need to see\nyour source here, Arven![VAR 0114(0008)]
My...sauce? So if I put some sauce on your\nveggies, you’ll eat them?![VAR 0114(0006)]
No, that’s not... Ugh, never mind. Just tell me\nif that mushy-body thing is actually real!\c\nHere, I’ll even eat a carrot or something right\nnow—just hurry up and tell me the truth!!![VAR 0114(0008)]
So, seriously, why do you always carry that frying\npan around?[VAR 0114(0006)]
What kinda question is that? It’s so I can always\ncook if I want to, duh![VAR 0114(0047)]
I even hug it as I go to sleep every night![VAR 0114(0047)]
It’s not like you can cook while you’re sleeping,\nbut...sure?[VAR 0114(0006)]
Hey, you’re carrying around a big ol’ rucksack\ntoo! It’s full of camping gear, yeah?![VAR 0114(0047)]
Oh! You noticed? Looks like you’re quite the\nbright little spark yourself![VAR 0114(0006)]
With this handy bag of mine, I can do more than\njust whip up a meal anytime I want—I’m ready to\r\ncamp out under the stars anywhere I like![VAR 0114(0006)]
Under the stars?! Like, you just sleep outdoors?\nWow, no way! That’s so cool![VAR 0114(0047)]
So, anything to spill about any, you know...special\nfeelings? Between you and anybody else in your\r\nlittle Paldea crew, I mean.[VAR 0114(0044)]
Special feelings...? Oh! Yeah, you know what—\nthere was something![VAR 0114(0006)]
For real? There was?! W-well, can you tell me\nabout it?[VAR 0114(0044)]
So, we were all jumping on Koraidon’s back to\ndive down into the Great Crater, you know?[VAR 0114(0006)]
So, we were all jumping on Miraidon’s back to\ndive down into the Great Crater, you know?[VAR 0114(0006)]
Uh-huh? Go on![VAR 0114(0044)]
Man, taking a leap into the open air above Area\nZero like that—talk about a special feeling![VAR 0114(0006)]
Oh, sheesh, what an anticlimax! You innocent\nlittle thing...[VAR 0114(0044)]
Your partner Mabosstiff is really special\nto you, huh?[VAR 0114(0043)]
That’s right! He and I’ve been best buds since\nI was a little kid and he was just a little Maschiff![VAR 0114(0006)]
Hey, that’s just like me and my Hydrapple! It’s\nbeen with me since it was a li’l Applin.[VAR 0114(0043)]
So is Hydrapple your best bud?[VAR 0114(0006)]
Hmmm, well... My Poliwrath and Politoed are\npretty special to me, too... Oh, and I really like\r\nmy Yanmega.[VAR 0114(0043)]
Aw man, and Furret’s also a precious pal of mine.\nI guess I just can’t pick a favorite...[VAR 0114(0043)]
Hey, that’s fine! There’s nothing wrong with\nthinking every one of your Pokémon is the best![VAR 0114(0006)]
Hehehe... I guess that’s an option too, huh?[VAR 0114(0043)]
You sent out a Sylveon earlier, didn’t you? It’s\njust too cute, isn’t it?![VAR 0114(0049)]
GAH! Wuh? Wh-who are you?![VAR 0114(0008)]
Oh! I’m sorry, but I couldn’t resist! My name is\nLacey, and I can’t help myself around cute things![VAR 0114(0049)]
Sorry. You just kinda...surprised me there...[VAR 0114(0008)]
Um! But you said my Sylveon was cute, right?\nTh-thanks...[VAR 0114(0008)]
Oh, of course! Cute things are a treasure meant\nto be shared with all![VAR 0114(0049)]
I, uh...don’t really get what you mean by that,\nbut...my other Veevees are pretty cute, too.\r\nWanna see?[VAR 0114(0008)]
Oh my gosh, do I ever![VAR 0114(0049)]
Hey, Penny, you’re pretty good with machines\nand stuff, right?[VAR 0114(0044)]
Better than most... What’s up?[VAR 0114(0008)]
I wanna get a new profile pic. Do you think you\ncan take a shot of me real quick?[VAR 0114(0044)]
Well, THAT’S a whole different skill than being\ngood with machines!\c\nWhy d’you want me to do it, anyway?[VAR 0114(0008)]
I mean, if I’m gonna update the pic, I might as\nwell get an amazing one from someone who\r\nknows what they’re doing, right?[VAR 0114(0044)]
Huh... But you know you’ll get pretty much the\nsame result no matter who takes the pic, right?[VAR 0114(0008)]
I mean, at least on the outside, you’re really\npretty, so—[VAR 0114(0008)]
Huh? Wait, what did you just say? That last bit\nin particular.[VAR 0114(0044)]
I said you’re really pretty, so it doesn’t matter\nwho takes the ph—[VAR 0114(0008)]
Oooh, music to my ears! One more time! Repeat\nit for me, come on![VAR 0114(0044)]
Uggghhh! Why are you like this?![VAR 0114(0008)]
So, errr... Nice weather...don’t you think?[VAR 0114(0008)]
I-is it? I’ve been inside all day, so I dunno...[VAR 0114(0043)]
A-ah, yeah, that’s true! My bad![VAR 0114(0008)]
Looks like we’re not ready for casual one-on-one\nchats just yet, huh...[VAR 0114(0008)]
Hehe... Yeah, guess not.[VAR 0114(0043)]
B-but it’s not like I don’t want to hang out with\nyou! I really want us to get along![VAR 0114(0008)]
Me too! We’re friends now, after all![VAR 0114(0043)]
Y-yeah! We sure are![VAR 0114(0008)]
Hey, Amarys! Can I have some of those\nsupplements that let Pokémon fly?[VAR 0114(0047)]
...Why do you want them?[VAR 0114(0048)]
’Cause I wanna fly?![VAR 0114(0047)]
...And why do you want to fly?[VAR 0114(0048)]
’Cause flying sounds like fun?![VAR 0114(0047)]
...I don’t follow you. Permission to use flying\nsupplements denied.[VAR 0114(0048)]
Aw, c’mon! You’re such a wet blanket! I wanna go\nflying on Magmortar![VAR 0114(0047)]
...That’s absurd.[VAR 0114(0048)]
You seem to be fired up again today, Crispin.[VAR 0114(0049)]
Well, yeah! I had a big, hearty meal and\neverything![VAR 0114(0047)]
Hee hee! Growing boys do eat quite a lot, don’t\nthey?[VAR 0114(0049)]
You bet! We’re always hungry, all the time![VAR 0114(0047)]
What, even right after you eat? That makes no\nsense, silly![VAR 0114(0049)]
Oh, but what was it you wanted to talk to me\nabout?[VAR 0114(0049)]
Oh, uh, right! Right, yeah, well... I wanted to tell\nyou, uh... See...maybe you and I could, y’know...[VAR 0114(0047)]
Uhhh, never mind! Not today! I’ll tell you another\ntime! Heh heh... Heh...[VAR 0114(0047)]
Ah, this again? Honestly...[VAR 0114(0049)]
Hey, Drayton! You were up to somethin’ behind\nthe scenes, weren’t you?![VAR 0114(0047)]
Whoa-ho. That came out of nowhere. What do\nyou think I was doing?[VAR 0114(004A)]
Like...I dunno, it’s hard for me to explain, but...\nyou roped in [VAR 0100(0000)], and, uh...[VAR 0114(0047)]
Oooh, you’re on the right track! Keep it up![VAR 0114(004A)]
You wanted to, like, get the League Club back to\nthe way it was...? And...something about Kieran?[VAR 0114(0047)]
Whoa, that’s...actually pretty solid! One last\nleap, Crispin. You can do it![VAR 0114(004A)]
Gaaahhh, I give up! I’m not good at usin’ my\nhead like this![VAR 0114(0047)]
Aww, so close.[VAR 0114(004A)]
My point is! You need to stop playin’ the villain,\nDrayton! Otherwise people are actually gonna\r\nstart thinkin’ you ARE a bad guy![VAR 0114(0047)]
Next time, if you wanna cook up a scheme, at\nleast talk to me about it![VAR 0114(0047)]
Heh heh heh. Fair point, buddy.[VAR 0114(004A)]
Hey, Crispin... You’re in the same class as Kiki,\nright?[VAR 0114(0044)]
Yep! Same class![VAR 0114(0047)]
How’s...how’s Kiki doing since he...y’know, since\nhe came back?[VAR 0114(0044)]
We study, we talk, we have battles... It’s pretty\nnormal, I guess?[VAR 0114(0047)]
Oh, yeah? And nobody’s picking on him or\nanything, right?[VAR 0114(0044)]
Well, I mean...some kids are scared of him ’cause\nof how he was...[VAR 0114(0047)]
But he’s much more approachable now, so I think\nit’s all good! I like Kieran how he is![VAR 0114(0047)]
Y’know... You’re a nice guy, Crispin. Even if you\nare kind of dense sometimes.[VAR 0114(0044)]
Did you really need to throw in that diss?![VAR 0114(0047)]
Hey, did you see that new episode yesterday?\nIt was awesome![VAR 0114(0047)]
S-sorry... I haven’t seen it yet.[VAR 0114(0043)]
Why’d you apologize?![VAR 0114(0047)]
Ah—well, I, uh... Wait, why DID I apologize...?[VAR 0114(0043)]
I guess ’cause you went out of your way to talk to\nme, and I couldn’t keep the conversation going?[VAR 0114(0043)]
Oh c’mon, I don’t mind that kinda thing![VAR 0114(0047)]
Yeah... Yeah, I guess you don’t.[VAR 0114(0043)]
Hey, how ’bout we watch next week’s episode\nin your room, then?[VAR 0114(0047)]
Sure![VAR 0114(0043)]
How do you define “cuteness”?[VAR 0114(0048)]
Gracious, that’s a difficult question to answer...[VAR 0114(0049)]
I assumed you would have a clear grasp of the\nconcept since you use the term so frequently...[VAR 0114(0048)]
Oh, that...simply wells up within me, from the\nbottom of my heart! I can’t hold it in!\c\nBut I can’t say it’s something I’ve thought hard\nabout. It’s more like a natural response...[VAR 0114(0049)]
Then let us attempt to define cuteness here and\nnow. How about...pink? Is that cute?[VAR 0114(0048)]
Yes! Pink is definitely cute![VAR 0114(0049)]
And smallness? Is that cute?[VAR 0114(0048)]
That’s right! Small things are quite often cute![VAR 0114(0049)]
But big things can be cute, too. I don’t think you\ncan simply define cuteness as “being small.”[VAR 0114(0049)]
Cuteness is...complex, I see.[VAR 0114(0048)]
You submitted your report seven minutes and\n20 seconds late, I see...[VAR 0114(0048)]
Hey, that means I submitted it, right? Do we\ngotta sweat the small stuff?[VAR 0114(004A)]
I...I cannot believe that you find such conduct\nacceptable.[VAR 0114(0048)]
I dunno. The teacher seemed pretty thrilled with\nmy work.[VAR 0114(004A)]
That is...doubtful.[VAR 0114(0048)]
Why is it that you never stick to schedules,\nDrayton?[VAR 0114(0048)]
Why don’t I stick to schedules?! Aw, c’mon, you\nknow why...[VAR 0114(004A)]
’Cause I’m too busy stickin’ it to the man![VAR 0114(004A)]
... ... ...What?[VAR 0114(0048)]
Heh. And the crowd goes wild![VAR 0114(004A)]
Here you go! Some Syrupy Apples, straight from\nKitakami![VAR 0114(0044)]
Thank you, Carmine. I truly appreciate it.[VAR 0114(0048)]
You always ask for apples whenever I go home...\nSure you aren’t tired of them?\c\nWe have mochi too, you know...[VAR 0114(0044)]
I have no need for mochi. Kitakami’s apples are\nfar superior.[VAR 0114(0048)]
Well, I guess they are a lot sweeter than the\napples you can get elsewhere, yeah...[VAR 0114(0044)]
The high sugar content gives them a superb\nflavor, and they stay fresh for a long time.[VAR 0114(0048)]
I also...like to use them for still life compositions.[VAR 0114(0048)]
Oh, that’s right! Of course you’d use them for\nyour paintings![VAR 0114(0044)]
I would very much enjoy painting a tree laden\nwith apples someday.[VAR 0114(0048)]
You should come to Kitakami sometime! I’ll show\nyou around myself![VAR 0114(0044)]
That would be lovely.[VAR 0114(0048)]
I’m gonna really try my best this time, Amarys.[VAR 0114(0043)]
I am...very glad to hear it.[VAR 0114(0048)]
It is good to see you back at the academy.[VAR 0114(0048)]
I know you and my sis were all worried about\nme... I’m really sorry about that.[VAR 0114(0043)]
Your apology is unnecessary.[VAR 0114(0048)]
Just keep putting one foot in front of the other.\nThat is all you need to do.[VAR 0114(0048)]
Yeah, you’re right! Thanks, Amarys![VAR 0114(0043)]
“One foot in front of the other”... Yeah!\nWhen you put it like that, it’s so true![VAR 0114(0043)]
...I wish you all the best, Kieran.[VAR 0114(0048)]
That’s it! Today you are definitely doing your\nduty as an Elite Four member—and no slacking![VAR 0114(0049)]
Hey, we both know I’ll just mess things up, and\nyou guys’ll have to do more work in the end.[VAR 0114(004A)]
Th-that is...entirely likely but beside the point![VAR 0114(0049)]
First things first—your attitude! You have to truly\nwant to do the work in order to do it well![VAR 0114(0049)]
Chop-chop! On your feet! Then, take these\ndocuments here—[VAR 0114(0049)]
Awww, c’monnn. I’m so sluggish...so tired...\nso sleepy...[VAR 0114(004A)]
No! That is just not right![VAR 0114(0049)]
It feels pretty right to me![VAR 0114(004A)]
Ooooh, you! YOU![VAR 0114(0049)]
Hey, so...some boy asked you to step out with\nhim earlier, huh? What was that about?[VAR 0114(0044)]
Oh... You saw that?[VAR 0114(0049)]
Yep! With my own two eyes![VAR 0114(0044)]
Well, he said he wanted to talk about something,\nso he took me over to this empty classroom...[VAR 0114(0049)]
He wanted to talk? Like, TALK talk? You’ve\ngotta give me the details![VAR 0114(0044)]
Oh! No, there’s nothing to tell...[VAR 0114(0049)]
The moment I told him who my daddy was,\nhe was off in a flash![VAR 0114(0049)]
Wow... You’re way more ruthless than you look.[VAR 0114(0044)]
How are things going for you, Kieran? No trouble\nkeeping up with your classes or anything?[VAR 0114(0049)]
Eep... Well, actually...I’m pretty out of the loop...[VAR 0114(0043)]
I didn’t study at all during my break...[VAR 0114(0043)]
That’s only natural! I don’t think anyone could\nexpect otherwise.[VAR 0114(0049)]
I tried asking Crispin, but he wasn’t any help...\nSeems like he hasn’t been keeping up either.[VAR 0114(0043)]
Oh. That’s also...quite natural. I wouldn’t expect\notherwise.[VAR 0114(0049)]
Well, I can teach you! And I can lend you my old\nnotes from last year![VAR 0114(0049)]
Wha—you sure? But I was such a jerk to you...[VAR 0114(0043)]
Bzzt! Nope! Wrong! What’s past is past, and I’m\nnot one for holding grudges. That’s just not right![VAR 0114(0049)]
We’re clubmates, aren’t we? We should be able\nto depend on one another for anything![VAR 0114(0049)]
Y-yeah, you’re right! Thanks, Lacey![VAR 0114(0043)]
C’mon, Carmine. Just lemme copy your\nhomework. C’mooon.[VAR 0114(004A)]
That’s really not how you should go about asking\npeople for favors, y’know...[VAR 0114(0044)]
Anyway, the answer is NO! Every time I lend you\nmy notes, they come back all crumpled up![VAR 0114(0044)]
Pleeease! I’ll iron ’em before I give ’em back![VAR 0114(004A)]
How about just not crumpling them up to begin\nwith...[VAR 0114(0044)]
Maaan, Lacey and Amarys wouldn’t let me copy\ntheirs either.[VAR 0114(004A)]
Pleeease! I’m begging! Can’t you see me\nbowing my head in humility?[VAR 0114(004A)]
The only thing I see is a bozo kicking back and\nrelaxing![VAR 0114(0044)]
Yo, ex-Champ.[VAR 0114(004A)]
H-hey, Drayton... I just wanted to say, um...[VAR 0114(0043)]
What’s wrong, ex-Champ?! Something happen?[VAR 0114(004A)]
I wish you’d stop calling me that...[VAR 0114(0043)]
By the way, I meant to ask...what does an\nex-Champion eat for dinner these days?[VAR 0114(004A)]
I told you to stop calling me that! Get it through\nyour thick skull already![VAR 0114(0043)]
Heh heh. I’m just indulgin’ in some well-earned\npayback here. Don’t mind me![VAR 0114(004A)]
Aw man... Whatever, Drayton...[VAR 0114(0043)]
So, how long are you going to keep your hair like\nthat, Kiki?[VAR 0114(0044)]
Huh, why? Does it look weird?[VAR 0114(0043)]
*sigh*... I’ve been meaning to say this all along...\c\nYou really should stop trying to be all edgy. It’s\nnot a good look for you.[VAR 0114(0044)]
Wh-what?! I’m not trying to be edgy![VAR 0114(0043)]
I just put my hair up so I can let loose during\nbattles! Aw man...[VAR 0114(0043)]
What, so you can’t “let loose” unless you tie your\nhair up? Aww, that’s too cute![VAR 0114(0044)]
Shut up, Sis! You’re such a dummy![VAR 0114(0043)]
Hey, what’d you just call me?! You’d better watch\nyour mouth if you know what’s good for you![VAR 0114(0044)]
You seem to be smiling a lot more often these\ndays, Rika.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Huh?! What’s this all of a sudden?! Kind of a\ncreepy thing to mention outta the blue...[VAR 0114(0013)]
I do beg your pardon.[VAR 0114(0011)]
I simply assumed you were in a good mood,\nseeing as you now get to meet your favorite\r\nTrainer more regularly.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Whaaat? I don’t know what you’re goin’ on\nabout. Ol’ Rika doesn’t have favorites![VAR 0114(0013)]
Heh... Of course. I’m sure you don’t.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Hey, look who’s talking! You seem to have a real\nhigh opinion of h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]imer too, boss![VAR 0114(0013)]
Oh my. It seems I’ve been found out.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Sheesh... Just don’t steal h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]imer away from Nemona.\nShe’ll throw a fit![VAR 0114(0013)]
Hmm... I’d prefer to avoid that. I’ll keep your\nadvice in mind.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Geeta! Geeta![VAR 0114(0014)]
Why hello, Poppy. What can I do for you?[VAR 0114(0011)]
I’m making a drawing of you, Geeta![VAR 0114(0014)]
A drawing of...me?[VAR 0114(0011)]
That’s right![VAR 0114(0014)]
Once I’m done coloring it, I’ll give it to you![VAR 0114(0014)]
Oh, Poppy...[VAR 0114(0011)]
Do you know the size of the paper you’re using?\nI must order a frame for it immediately.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Oh, um, um, I’m not sure...[VAR 0114(0014)]

Cassiopeia here.[VAR 0114(0009)]
I see you’re getting close to one of Team\nStar’s bases.[VAR 0114(0009)]
I take it this means you’ve decided to join\nmy operation?[VAR 0114(0009)]
That’s right
I guess so
Thank you.[VAR 0114(0009)]
With this, you’re officially a member of\nOperation Starfall![VAR 0114(0009)]
Hold on a second![VAR 0114(002C)]
Does this “Operation Starfall” of yours have\nroom for one more member?[VAR 0114(002C)]
Wha—? Who are you?![VAR 0114(0009)]
The name’s Clive.[VAR 0114(001E)]
Oh? And how long have you been spying on us?[VAR 0114(0009)]
No need to get your hackles raised.[VAR 0114(001E)]
I’m a pal of our mutual friend here. Isn’t that\nright, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(001E)]
I guess...maybe?
We’re not pals!
Ahaha! Shy as ever, I see![VAR 0114(001E)]
We’re talking about going up against Team Star\nhere. It’s not something you can join in for fun.[VAR 0114(0009)]
I’m well aware. I just need to sort out some...\nunsettled business with Team Star, that’s all.[VAR 0114(001E)]
Besides, I tend to get the job done well. Not\nthat you can take my word for it, but it’s true.[VAR 0114(001E)]
... ... ...\c\nI suppose I’m hardly in a position to refuse help.\nWelcome to the operation, Clive.[VAR 0114(0009)]
Great. That settles it, then.[VAR 0114(001E)]
I think I heard your name earlier... Cassiopeia,\nwas it? Who exactly are you?[VAR 0114(001E)]
Team Star and I...share some history. That’s all I’ll\nsay for now.[VAR 0114(0009)]
I see. In that case, I won’t press you further.[VAR 0114(001E)]
Good. Now, back to business—let’s talk\nOperation Starfall.[VAR 0114(0009)]
Yes. What would you have us do?[VAR 0114(001E)]
Simply put, I want you to raid each one of\nTeam Star’s bases.[VAR 0114(0009)]
Then you’ll defeat the bosses of the team...and\nput an end to their rule![VAR 0114(0009)]
“Put an end to their rule”...? You mean we need\nto oust these bosses from their roles somehow?[VAR 0114(001E)]
That’s right. Team Star is made up of five squads,\nand each of those squads has its own base.[VAR 0114(0009)]
You should be able to see the front gates of one\nof those bases now, in fact.[VAR 0114(0009)]
Ah, yes...I can see them over there.[VAR 0114(001E)]
On the other side of those is the base proper.[VAR 0114(0009)]
And somewhere within that base lies one of your\ntargets: a squad boss.[VAR 0114(0009)]
OK. I’m starting to get the idea.[VAR 0114(001E)]
Well, that’s just the outline. The key to the whole\noperation is the code that the team has to follow.[VAR 0114(0009)]
If someone challenges one of the squad bosses\nto a battle, they have no choice but to accept.[VAR 0114(0009)]
And what’s more, if they just so happen to lose\nthat battle...\c\nthey must forfeit their role as boss altogether![VAR 0114(0009)]
I went ahead and issued challenges to each base\nunder your name, [VAR 0100(0000)].\c\nThey’re basically declarations of war.[VAR 0114(0009)]
Now all of Team Star knows that we’re looking\nfor a fight.[VAR 0114(0009)]
So let’s say we defeat all the bosses and they\nstep down from their roles... What happens next?[VAR 0114(001E)]
[~ 66]
The rest of the team crumbles with no one left to\nlead them. That’s what happens.[VAR 0114(0009)]
[~ 66]
It’s a solid plan, but not without wrinkles.[VAR 0114(0009)]
Each base has a bunch of Pokémon inside to\nfend off intruders, and the bases themselves are\r\na considerable size.[VAR 0114(0009)]
Your garden-variety Trainer would be overrun\nlong before they’d get anywhere near the boss.[VAR 0114(0009)]
That’s why your skills are essential to this\noperation, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0009)]
[~ 66]
[~ 66]
Defeat the Pokémon inside the base, and drag\nthe boss out from where they’re hiding.[VAR 0114(0009)]
First things first, though—you’ll need to deal with\nany grunts that might be guarding the front gates.[VAR 0114(0009)]
And what will you be doing in the meantime?[VAR 0114(001E)]
Like I said before, I have a history with Team Star.[VAR 0114(0009)]
That means I can’t operate out in the open.\nI’ll back you up from afar.[VAR 0114(0009)]
All right. And what will my role be?[VAR 0114(001E)]
Sorry, but I don’t trust you completely just yet...\c\nFor now, I’d like you to monitor the bases and\nact as [VAR 0100(0000)]’s support.[VAR 0114(0009)]
You’re a cautious one, all right... I respect that.[VAR 0114(001E)]
I’ll be in touch again when the plan advances to\nthe next stage. Good hunting out there.[VAR 0114(0009)]
Welp. Go get ’em, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(001E)]
Director Clavell...?
You look familiar...
I have no idea what you mean. But if anyone asks\nyou about me, remember this...[VAR 0114(001E)]

Why did you join?
What’s your endgame?
I need answers, that’s all.\c\nHow do I resolve this situation with Team Star...\nand what’s causing its members’ odd behavior?[VAR 0114(001E)]
What situation?
Odd behavior?
Team Star is the subject of more than a few nasty\nrumors swirling around the academy, you know.[VAR 0114(001E)]
Some say their bullying has caused a worrying\nnumber of students to drop out of school...\c\nOthers say they’re holed up in their bases,\nplotting to cause trouble for the academy.[VAR 0114(001E)]
But these are rumors. The matter I am directly\nconfronted with is something else...[VAR 0114(001E)]
I’m talking about Team Star’s persistent truancy.\nThey’ve all been skipping class for a while now...[VAR 0114(001E)]
Five of them in particular—the so-called “bosses”\nof Team Star—haven’t so much as set foot inside\r\na classroom for over a year.[VAR 0114(001E)]
And it seems the team’s rank and file have\nrecently started stirring up mischief as well.[VAR 0114(001E)]
That’s why I took it upon myself to issue a direct\norder to Team Star to disband.[VAR 0114(001E)]
I informed them that should they refuse, I would\nhave no choice but to expel all students affiliated\r\nwith their team...[VAR 0114(001E)]
But I’m afraid there’s been no response. And the\ndeadline I set for them to make their choice\r\nbetween dissolution or expulsion is nigh upon us.[VAR 0114(001E)]

Since the big boss never set up their own base\nand keeps their identity hidden, I take it they’re\r\nnot one for the spotlight.[VAR 0114(0009)]
But once all the squad bosses are out of action,\nthe big boss’ll finally have to take the stage.[VAR 0114(0009)]

Personally, I don’t think Cassiopeia feels any hate\nor resentment toward Team Star.[VAR 0114(001E)]
No, there must be some other reason behind\nOperation Starfall...\c\nBut what could it be?[VAR 0114(001E)]

...As you know, Team Star was formed by a group\nof students who were being bullied at school.[VAR 0114(0009)]
Shortly after forming the team, these students—\nnone other than the squad bosses themselves—\r\nconfronted their bullies head on.[VAR 0114(0009)]
The outcome was a resounding victory for\nTeam Star...\c\nThough you could hardly call it a contest.[VAR 0114(0009)]

Though Clive and myself being the same person\nwas no lie, mind you...[VAR 0114(000A)]
Cassiopeia’s true identity remains hidden.[VAR 0114(000A)]

That is why I sought to spare you from having to\nconfront them in battle.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Their sorrows...should not be yours to bear.[VAR 0114(000A)]
However, Cassiopeia has settled on a course of\naction and is determined to see it through.[VAR 0114(000A)]
I do not imagine any ordinary student could hope\nto stand against them and win.[VAR 0114(000A)]
So, I challenged you to a battle to test your skill.[VAR 0114(000A)]
If you had lost, it would have fallen to me to\nbring down Cassiopeia. Such was my resolve.[VAR 0114(000A)]
But it turns out you are as strong as you are kind.\nIf anyone has a chance at saving that poor child,\r\nit is surely you.[VAR 0114(000A)]

All I can say to you guys is...thanks.[VAR 0114(0009)]

Bye-bye, guys... Thanks for everything.[VAR 0114(0009)]

[VAR BD06(0000)]Thanks for everything, [VAR 0100(0000)].\nAnd\r\nyou\r\ntoo, Clive...[VAR 0114(0008)]
I’m glad I could see this through to the end.[VAR 0114(001E)]
I guess this is it for Team Star...and me, too—[VAR 0114(0008)]
Hold that thought, Mis— Ah...Penny! I’d like to\ncheck something with you first.[VAR 0114(001E)]
Check...what?[VAR 0114(0008)]
Why resort to something like Operation Starfall\nif you’re the big boss of Team Star?\c\nWasn’t there any other way to handle this?[VAR 0114(001E)]
I tried telling the bosses that we were done once\nbefore. But they still didn’t quit...[VAR 0114(0008)]
Why not simply order them to?[VAR 0114(001E)]
Our code states that no one in the team has the\nright to order people around. I could ask them\r\nall to do stuff, but I could never order them.[VAR 0114(0008)]
So, it’s back to the code once again... The bosses\nmust’ve taken it very seriously.[VAR 0114(001E)]
They did. That’s why I knew I could use it to force\nTeam Star to disband.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Because the bosses would do anything the code\nrequired of them? Even leave the team?[VAR 0114(001E)]
Yes... And according to the code, they had to\naccept any challenge made to them.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Thus the idea for Operation Starfall...[VAR 0114(001E)]
Cassiopeia. Let me ask you one last thing.[VAR 0114(001E)]
What does Team Star— No, what do your friends\nin the team mean to you?[VAR 0114(001E)]
... ... ...\nThey’re...[VAR 0114(0008)]
They’re my greatest treasure.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Splendid. Thank you for apprising me of the\nsituation, Miss Penny.[VAR 0114(001E)]
Wha—?[VAR 0114(0008)]
Now, young lady, there’s something I should very\nmuch like to discuss with you.[VAR 0114(001E)]
Hey, quit it with the old geezer act, Clive!\nYou’re creeping me out...[VAR 0114(0008)]
...Indeed. Well then, before we talk further, allow\nme to reveal to you my own secret identity![VAR 0114(001E)]
Ha-hah![VAR 0114(001E)]
D-Director Clavell?![VAR 0114(0008)]
Just as Cassiopeia was your disguise, the boy\nyou knew as Clive was mine![VAR 0114(000A)]
But... But why?![VAR 0114(0008)]
[~ 32]
I needed a way to talk to Team Star on\nequal terms.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Students do tend to shy from speaking their mind\nto their teachers, after all... Much more so when\r\nfaced with the director of the academy.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Yeah, but...where do I even start? Wasn’t the\noutfit a bit much?\c\nPlus I have some big feelings about that wig...[VAR 0114(0008)]
Ahem! Well, that’s quite enough of that for now.\c\nEveryone! Why don’t you come on out?[VAR 0114(000A)]

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Text File : team_0160
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Now then, Miss Penny—and each of you young\nbosses, as well.[VAR 0114(000A)]
On behalf of the academy, I have something I\nwould like to say to Team Star.[VAR 0114(000A)]
You all have...my sincerest apologies.[VAR 0114(000A)]
...Come again?[VAR 0114(0008)]
As director of the academy, I let you down. My\nhandling of your situation was a dismal failure...[VAR 0114(000A)]
Wha—? I still don’t... I mean... Why?[VAR 0114(0008)]
You all told me about your reasons for forming\nTeam Star and about your subsequent actions.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Ever since my first days as director, all I’ve ever\nexperienced of the academy is an environment\r\nblessedly free from bullying.[VAR 0114(000A)]
But I now know this peace was built on the backs\nof your hurt and anger—and, of course, your\r\nimmense courage in putting things to right.[VAR 0114(000A)]
And so, I’ll get straight to the conclusion.[VAR 0114(000A)]
The academy’s order for Team Star to disband\nand my threat to expel those who did not obey...\r\nare hereby revoked![VAR 0114(000A)]
Does that mean what I think it means...?[VAR 0114(0021)]
Indeed! Team Star can continue to exist, should\nthat be your wish![VAR 0114(000A)]
Woo-hoo! Penny, isn’t this great? Now we can all\nstay together![VAR 0114(0022)]
O, mine heart is giddy with glee![VAR 0114(0023)]
B-but...I betrayed all of you...[VAR 0114(0008)]
You mean Operation Starfall? Director Clavell\ntold us all about it![VAR 0114(0020)]
Far as we heard, you only went through with it\nto save us from getting expelled!\c\nYou were just worried about us, right?[VAR 0114(0021)]
Not like we’d ever chuck the team just ’cause\nsomeone told us to, after all. Ain’t our style.[VAR 0114(001F)]
I cannot even begin to imagine how you must\nhave fear’d for us, Lady Penny...[VAR 0114(0023)]
Sorry for making you worry, B.B. We’re all\nOK now.[VAR 0114(0022)]
But—! Even so...[VAR 0114(0008)]
Hold on, everyone. I’ve more to say.[VAR 0114(000A)]
As previously stated, the requirement for Team\nStar to disband has been revoked.[VAR 0114(000A)]
However! There are still some unsettled matters\nto discuss. Allow me to provide a few examples...[VAR 0114(000A)]
Your protracted truancy! Your brazen\ncustomization of school uniforms![VAR 0114(000A)]
Your unauthorized usage of academy equipment![VAR 0114(000A)]
Your reckless modification and jeopardous\ndriving of Pokémon-powered vehicles![VAR 0114(000A)]
Need I go on? Your flagrant disregard for school\nrules cannot simply be overlooked![VAR 0114(000A)]
Thus, as punishment, you will all be required to\nengage in community service.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Community...service?[VAR 0114(0008)]
Yes. Specifically, I will be asking you to manage\nthe STCs.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Aaand that stands for...?[VAR 0114(0008)]
The Star Training Centers![VAR 0114(000A)]
They shall be facilities for cultivating Pokémon\nTrainers’ talents. I plan for the academy to found\r\nthem in collaboration with the Pokémon League.[VAR 0114(000A)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]The idea came to me when I saw M[VAR 1100(00FF,0305)]asteriss\n[VAR 0100(0000)]\r\nbattling\r\nh[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]iser\r\nway\r\nthrough\r\nyour bases.[VAR 0114(000A)]
The bases’ construction, as well as the battle\ntactics employed by the students in Team Star,\r\nare remarkably unique and creative![VAR 0114(000A)]
I would ask that you continue your team activities\nbut henceforth as STC staff members, using your\r\nformer bases as training facilities.[VAR 0114(000A)]
And that is the sum of it. Does anyone have\nany concerns?[VAR 0114(000A)]
Um...no? It sounds like fun, so I don’t see how\nthis’d be anything but a win-win...[VAR 0114(0008)]
This may be a weird thing to say since the STCs\nare supposed to be a punishment and all, but\r\nyou should totally join in too, Penny![VAR 0114(0020)]
’Tis true... We would most happily have you at\nour sides, my lady.[VAR 0114(0023)]
We can go to school together too! That way if\nanything happens, we’ll be there to protect you![VAR 0114(0022)]
We were already talkin’ about how great it’d be\nto have both Team Star and school in our lives.\r\nThis’d be a sweet deal for us![VAR 0114(0021)]
So, whaddya say...?[VAR 0114(001F)]
You guys...[VAR 0114(0008)]
[VAR 0100(0000)]...what do you think?[VAR 0114(0008)]
I think it sounds great!
Give it your best!
Huh? B-but—! Ummm... I just...[VAR 0114(0008)]
No need to give your response right this moment,\nMiss Penny. Do take some time to decide.[VAR 0114(000A)]
For now, at least, I think our little group should\ngo their separate ways.\c\nAh. Not to say you should break up Team Star\nafter all! I simply meant it is time to leave.[VAR 0114(000A)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]M[VAR 1100(00FF,0305)]asteriss [VAR 0100(0000)]. Please stop\nby\r\nmy\r\noffice\r\nlater,\r\nif\r\nyou would.[VAR 0114(000A)]

I wanted to thank you for all your hard work in\nresolving the situation with Team Star.[VAR 0114(000A)]
If not for you, I suspect I would have done the\nteam a grievous injustice in my choice of\r\npunishment for their actions.[VAR 0114(000A)]
You have my sincere gratitude.[VAR 0114(000A)]

About the STCs... I’d like to work on them\ntogether with the rest of Team Star.[VAR 0114(0008)]
That’s wonderful news. Thank you very much\nfor your favorable response.[VAR 0114(000A)]
But, um...I...I should be punished more heavily\nthan the others, I think...[VAR 0114(0008)]
Why so? Because of Operation Starfall?[VAR 0114(000A)]
No, not that. Because of the other really bad\nthing I did...[VAR 0114(0008)]
And what would that be?[VAR 0114(000A)]
Um... Y’know the LP I gave you both in exchange\nfor helping me with Operation Starfall...?[VAR 0114(0008)]
I got hold of it sort of...illegally...by hacking the\nPokémon League’s LP management system.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Ah. I see. That is...quite the revelation.[VAR 0114(000A)]
I did not think such a thing was even possible\nin the first place.[VAR 0114(000A)]
It wasn’t all that har— Errr, I mean...I’m really\nsorry and I won’t do it again.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Hmm. This matter is rather out of my jurisdiction,\nI’m afraid.[VAR 0114(000A)]
I will have to consult Ms. Geeta, the Pokémon\nLeague chairwoman, on how best to proceed.[VAR 0114(000A)]
I figured as much...[VAR 0114(0008)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]I do apologize, M[VAR 1100(00FF,0305)]asteriss\n[VAR 0100(0000)],\r\nbut\r\nI\r\nwill\r\nhave\r\nto\r\nask\r\nyou\r\nto\r\ngive\r\nus\r\nsome privacy.[VAR 0114(000A)]

Very well, Champion Nemona. I trust you to\nhandle this in my stead.[VAR 0114(002C)]
Sure thing! You can count on me. In fact, I bet\nthis is gonna be fun![VAR 0114(0004)]
I’m glad to hear it. Good day, then.[VAR 0114(002C)]
Oh—pardon me.[VAR 0114(002C)]
Oh, [VAR 0100(0000)]! Hey![VAR 0114(0004)]
Who was that?
She looked awesome!
Piqued your interest, huh? That lady is...\nWell, they call her La Primera!\c\nShe’s strong, she can do pretty much anything,\nshe’s got cool practically coming out her ears...\c\nShe’s basically everything I wanna be—or that\nany Pokémon Trainer would wanna be, really![VAR 0114(0004)]

Now, I know you said you’re all about completing\nthe Pokédex! But hear me out...[VAR 0114(0004)]
Well, since your heart’s already set on becoming\na really strong Trainer...I’ve got an idea for you![VAR 0114(0004)]
If you’re still trying to decide what it is you’re\nlooking for...I’ve got an idea for you![VAR 0114(0004)]
You should try to reach [VAR FF00(0006)]Champion Rank[VAR FF00(0000)] like me![VAR 0114(0004)]
Yeah, I will!
I don’t know...
Oh wow! Hang on, though—I’ve got a whole spiel\nI wanna give you. Here goes...[VAR 0114(0004)]
Aww, but talent like yours deserves to be used!\nHear me out...[VAR 0114(0004)]
The Trainers who reach Champion Rank are the\nones who raise their Pokémon really strong.\c\nThey’re pro-tier battlers. Their moves keep\ncrowds absolutely on the edge of their seats![VAR 0114(0004)]
You have to prove yourself to the Pokémon\nLeague to officially get the title of Champion.[VAR 0114(0004)]
And to do that, you have to do more than just\ntake classes here.\c\nYou’ve got to take on eight Pokémon Gyms and\nwin so you can collect their Gym Badges![VAR 0114(0004)]
Once you’ve done all that, all that’s left is a\nspecial test—the Champion Assessment.[VAR 0114(0004)]
And once you pass THAT, then at long last you’ll\nbe a Champion![VAR 0114(0004)]
It’s every Pokémon Trainer’s dream! The coolest\ntitle anyone could ever hope to get!\c\nNot to brag or anything![VAR 0114(0004)]
I reached Champion Rank during our last\nTreasure Hunt, you know![VAR 0114(0004)]
Oh, the Treasure Hunt is a special independent\nstudy thing we’ve got here. Should happen soon!\c\nOur last one started not long after the beginning\nof this school year![VAR 0114(0004)]
It’s great! You get to leave school to go have an\nadventure and learn however you want![VAR 0114(0004)]
I guess you could say my journey to becoming\na Champion was the treasure I found...maybe?\r\nI dunno yet if that’s the answer I’m looking for...[VAR 0114(0004)]
Anyway, I’ve got a feeling I’d be able to get even\nstronger if you and I were both working at it...[VAR 0114(0004)]

You know, your friend Nemona is the youngest to\nachieve Champion Rank in all Paldean history...[VAR 0114(0012)]
It is entirely possible that such great potential lies\nwithin you as well.[VAR 0114(0012)]
Should you continue striving to reach Champion\nRank, you will one day have to battle me.[VAR 0114(0012)]
You would be wise to train hard starting now.\nIt will save you from experiencing the bitter\r\nregret of defeat.[VAR 0114(0012)]
Oh, and do come along to my art class sometime.\nI would be thrilled to have you attend.[VAR 0114(0012)]

Well, you’re up to the challenge for sure!\nBut, like, just to be safe...[VAR 0114(0004)]

Yeeeah! There’s that enthusiasm![VAR 0114(0004)]

Before you take on a Gym, it’s good to see if you\ncan find the battle court in town and check it out.[VAR 0114(0004)]
It helps to see where the court is, what it’s made\nof—stuff like that. Those things might affect how\r\nthe battle goes![VAR 0114(0004)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Y’know, [VAR 0100(0000)], one look at\nyour\r\nface,\r\nand\r\nit’s\r\nobvious\r\nthat\r\nyou’re\r\ngetting\r\neven stronger![VAR 0114(0004)]

All right... Ready?[VAR 0114(0004)]
Let’s have us a fruitful battle![VAR 0114(0004)]
Man, you sure battle like someone with more\nthan two Gym Badges![VAR 0114(0004)]
Oof, sorry! That’s my bad for sending out such\nstrong Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0004)]
Well, that was a great battle! Fruitful for sure![VAR 0114(0004)]
Here, take these as thanks![VAR 0114(0004)]
I’d challenge you again literally right now...\nbut Champions have to be understanding.\r\nSo I’ll hang back and respect your time![VAR 0114(0004)]
Keep on collecting badges for now, and let’s\nbattle next time we run into each other at a Gym![VAR 0114(0004)]
And, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0004)]
I hope you get even stronger. Like, way...way...\nWAY stronger![VAR 0114(0004)]

[VAR BD06(0000)]And your name is [VAR 0100(0000)],\nif I\r\nrecall\r\ncorrectly...[VAR 0114(002C)]
Tell me, do you seek to become a Champion?[VAR 0114(002C)]
Just what I hoped to hear. You have a rare talent,\nespecially for your age.\c\nAim high—greater heights are within your reach.[VAR 0114(002C)]
Oh my, are you certain? You have a rare talent,\nespecially for your age.\c\nIt’d be a shame for that talent to go to waste.[VAR 0114(002C)]
Oh, but I’ve gotten ahead of myself.[VAR 0114(002C)]
I am Geeta, chairwoman of the Pokémon League,\nthe organization that runs these Gyms.[VAR 0114(0011)]

Hey, kiddo! I heard you’re, like, way too good\nat battling! Yeah?[VAR 0114(002C)]
Yeah!
Not THAT good...
Nahaha! You got some spirit, big shot![VAR 0114(002C)]
Pah! You can’t fool me that easily. No need to\nplay humble, you hear?[VAR 0114(002C)]

That’s me! Rika here, at your service.[VAR 0114(0013)]
And hey, I know I’m pretty, but no need to get\nintimidated or anything.[VAR 0114(0013)]
She is a little...farcical, shall we say. But like\nmyself, she is a member of the Elite Four.[VAR 0114(0012)]

Oooh, haha. Yeah, that checks out.[VAR 0114(0013)]
But the battles you’ll face at these Gyms really\nratchet up the farther you go.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Indeed. Your average Trainer abandons the\nchallenge at roughly this very point.[VAR 0114(0012)]
But not you, right, kiddo?[VAR 0114(0013)]

Another Gym Leader defeated. Well done.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Rika informed me that there was an unusual\nTrainer worth keeping an eye on.[VAR 0114(0011)]
It seems she meant you. I’d guessed as much.[VAR 0114(0011)]
I had the pleasure of observing your last match.\nI was impressed by the fantastic skill you showed![VAR 0114(0011)]
If you manage to keep your momentum and\nachieve Champion Rank...[VAR 0114(0011)]
I will be very interested in inviting you to the\nPokémon League and—[VAR 0114(0011)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Hey hey, [VAR 0100(0000)]! I’ve got my\nteam\r\nall\r\npicked out![VAR 0114(0004)]
And I saw you battling the Gym Leader! You just\nkeep getting better![VAR 0114(0004)]
How good to see you again, Champion Nemona.\nIt has certainly been a while.[VAR 0114(0011)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Whoa! Wait! La Primera?\nWith [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0004)]
Why do you call her that?
Is she that important?
Wait, did I forget to give you the full\nexplanation?![VAR 0114(0004)]
Everyone calls Ms. Geeta “La Primera” because\nshe’s just that—she’s the real number one, even\r\nhigher than us regular Champions...[VAR 0114(0004)]
She’s the [VAR FF00(0006)]Top Champion[VAR FF00(0000)]![VAR 0114(0004)]
I do indeed hold that claim. Alongside my role\nas chairwoman of the Pokémon League, that is.[VAR 0114(0011)]
I thought you were too busy to spend your time\nchecking in on Gyms![VAR 0114(0004)]
I’m not here to inspect the Gym. I’ve come to\nscout some rather promising young talent.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Whoaaa. I look away for one second and you’re\nfamous, [VAR 0100(0000)]?![VAR 0114(0004)]

Huh? What is it?[VAR 0114(0004)]
I would very much like to observe this match,\nif that is all right.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Oooh, haha! Totally fine by me![VAR 0114(0004)]
Sounds fun, right, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0004)]
Thank you kindly. I’m already excited to see you\ntwo face off.[VAR 0114(0011)]

You remember how it all works, right? Once you\nget badges from all the Gyms...[VAR 0114(0004)]
you get to throw down against the strongest\nPokémon Trainers around![VAR 0114(0004)]
Yes. You must face the Pokémon League.[VAR 0114(0011)]
It is located to the northwest of Mesagoza.[VAR 0114(0011)]
The Pokémon League is where Trainers are\nreborn as Champions—the greatest honor that\r\nthey might dream of.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Collecting eight Gym Badges sets you up to\ntake the Champion Assessment.[VAR 0114(0004)]
If you can face the challenge of the final\nexaminer and win, you’ll become a Champion![VAR 0114(0004)]
Just imagine how that moment would feel.\nTry getting into that Champion mindset![VAR 0114(0004)]
Now, set your sights on reaching that big,\nimportant stage...and let’s battl—[VAR 0114(0004)]

Well, you should all be in great shape now thanks\nto La Primera![VAR 0114(0004)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]OK, [VAR 0100(0000)]. Time to put\nour\r\ngame\r\nfaces\r\nback on![VAR 0114(0004)]
Let’s have us another fruitful battle![VAR 0114(0004)]
An amazing display of talent, even against one\nas skilled as Champion Nemona.[VAR 0114(0011)]
That was a splendid match. I enjoyed watching\nvery much.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Now even La Primera thinks you’re one to watch.\nYou’ve got so much potential![VAR 0114(0004)]
The way you’re going, I better watch my back![VAR 0114(0004)]
Did battling in front of La Primera give you the\njitters, maybe?[VAR 0114(0004)]
Well, I might’ve won, but it was obvious how\nmuch you’ve bonded with your Pokémon![VAR 0114(0004)]
Y’know, since the first time we met, I’ve been\nweirdly sure of one thing...[VAR 0114(0004)]
You’re gonna become a Champion—no doubt\nabout it, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0004)]
The rest of these Gyms? You can take ’em!\nHundred percent, no problem![VAR 0114(0004)]
I agree. In fact, you should take this. Consider it\nan investment in your future.[VAR 0114(0011)]
If a Pokémon uses that move while Terastallized,\nthe move’s type will change to the Tera Type\r\nof the Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0011)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]One day, [VAR 0100(0000)], you and\nme\r\nare\r\ngonna\r\nhave\r\nthe\r\ngreatest\r\nbattle\r\nof\r\nall!\r\nI know it![VAR 0114(0004)]
I’m gonna go train up—even more than I already\nhave been![VAR 0114(0004)]
She shows you such support and friendship.\nOr perhaps...\c\nPerhaps she hopes you truly might rival her?[VAR 0114(0011)]
No... I think it’s no mere hope. She seems to have\ncomplete faith that you will catch up to her.[VAR 0114(0011)]
At any rate, allow me to return you to the Gym\nwhere I found you.[VAR 0114(0011)]

As a member of the Elite Four, I await the day\nyou come to face me with great anticipation![VAR 0114(0012)]

[VAR BD06(0000)]Well, good luck, [VAR 0100(0000)]! And\nwish\r\nme\r\nluck, too![VAR 0114(0004)]
It’s unusual for me to see her so excited—\nthough perhaps not for you.[VAR 0114(0011)]
She must really be happy that she finally has a\nfriend who can keep pace with her own talents.[VAR 0114(0011)]
There’s a special kind of strength that can only\nbe reached by competing with a good rival.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Count me among those eager to see how far\nyou two can go![VAR 0114(0011)]
In any case, I’ll be waiting for you at the\nPokémon League, northwest of Mesagoza.[VAR 0114(0011)]

Please, do have a seat.[VAR 0114(0013)]
I, Rika, will be your interviewer.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Let’s get started with the first portion of the\nChampion Assessment.[VAR 0114(0013)]
We begin with the interview.[VAR 0114(0013)]
First things first—let me see how many Gym\nBadges you have...\c\nExcellent! You have all eight![VAR 0114(0013)]
Next, I’d like to ask you a few questions, if you\nwouldn’t mind, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0013)]
Please think carefully, as you may automatically\nfail the interview depending on your answers.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Let’s begin.[VAR 0114(0013)]

Please tell me the name of the school you are\nenrolled in.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Manzana Academy
Naranja Academy

Ah, that’s right.[VAR 0114(0013)]
So, what brings you to the Pokémon League\ntoday?[VAR 0114(0013)]
I came to catch Pokémon
I came to become a Champion
Just for fun, I guess...
Yes, indeed. Why else would you be here,\nI suppose.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Now, what do you intend to do if and when you\nbecome a Champion?[VAR 0114(0013)]
I want to become even stronger
I want to battle Nemona
I want to find treasure
I see. Interesting.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Tell me: Which of the eight Gyms gave you the\nmost difficulty?[VAR 0114(0013)]
Cortondo Gym
Artazon Gym
Cascarrafa Gym
Levincia Gym
Medali Gym
Glaseado Gym
Montenevera Gym
Alfornada Gym

And what was the name of the Gym Leader you\nfaced there?[VAR 0114(0013)]
Larry

Brassius
Grusha
Iono
Kofu
Ryme
Tulip
I’m glad you seem to remember.[VAR 0114(0013)]
But do you remember which type of Pokémon\n[VAR 0100(0001)] used?[VAR 0114(0013)]
Water
Grass
Electric
Ice
Bug
Ghost
Psychic
Normal
Wonderful.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Building the skills needed for the Champion\nAssessment is no small feat.[VAR 0114(0013)]
You must have met a lot of Pokémon to get\nhere, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0013)]
What was the category of the Pokémon you\nchose to be your first partner?[VAR 0114(0013)]
The Grass Cat Pokémon
The Fire Croc Pokémon
The Duckling Pokémon
Very good, very good.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Now, please forgive me, but I’m going to repeat\na previous question.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Remind me, what do you intend to do if\nand when you become a Champion?[VAR 0114(0013)]
I want to become even stronger
I want to battle Nemona
I want to find treasure
Ah, yes, that’s right.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Next is the final question for this interview.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Do you like Pokémon, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0013)]
... ... ...\n... ... ...[VAR 0114(0013)]
I see...[VAR 0114(0013)]
That concludes this interview.[VAR 0114(0013)]
One of the staff will let you know the results.\nThank you again for your time.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Now, please excuse me.[VAR 0114(0013)]
How’d that happen...?[VAR 0114(0013)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Sorry to keep you waiting,\n[VAR 0100(0000)].
Now, regarding the results of the interview\nportion of your Champion Assessment...
I’m sorry to say you didn’t pass.
Just between you and me, I’ve heard they won’t\ninterview you seriously until you have all eight\r\nGym Badges.
You can take the Champion Assessment as many\ntimes as you want.
I hope you come back for another try soon!
Thank you very much for your time today.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Please, do have a seat.[VAR 0114(0013)]
I, Rika, will be your interviewer.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Now, let’s get started with the first portion of\nthe Champion Assessment.[VAR 0114(0013)]
As I mentioned, this portion will take the form of\nan interview.[VAR 0114(0013)]
First things first, let me see how many Gym\nBadges you have...\c\nI see... So you have [VAR 0200(0001)] badges.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Now, I’d like to ask you a few questions, if you\nwouldn’t mind, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0013)]
Please think carefully, as you may be disqualified\nimmediately depending on your answers.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Let’s begin.[VAR 0114(0013)]
How did you get here today?[VAR 0114(0013)]
I walked
I rode on my Pokémon
I came by Flying Taxi
Uh huh...[VAR 0114(0013)]
What type was the very first Pokémon you chose?[VAR 0114(0013)]
Grass
Fire
Water
I take it you like the [VAR 0103(0001)] type, then.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Next, please tell me why you want to become\na Champion.[VAR 0114(0013)]
I want to test my skills
I want to become stronger
I was invited by a friend
Each person has a different reason, of course.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Now, please tell me... Is there anything that’s\nvery popular at your school?[VAR 0114(0013)]
Pokémon battles
Studying
The Treasure Hunt
I see. I’m glad it’s something wholesome.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Next is the final question from me.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Do you have any comments or questions\nabout the Pokémon League or the Gyms?[VAR 0114(0013)]
This interview is pretty tough...
The Gym Tests are a lot of fun!
The Gym Leaders are all really strong
Nothing in particular
You might feel differently if you gather all eight\nGym Badges...[VAR 0114(0013)]
Each Gym Leader is responsible for coming up\nwith their own Gym’s test.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Oh, of course. They’re the ideal Gym Leaders,\nhandpicked by La Primera herself.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Oh, is that so? Very well...[VAR 0114(0013)]
That concludes this interview.[VAR 0114(0013)]
One of the staff will let you know the results.\nThank you again for your time.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Now, please excuse me.[VAR 0114(0013)]

Good job, kiddo.[VAR 0114(0013)]
That about wraps up the interview.[VAR 0114(0013)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]And let me be the first to congratulate you,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]...[VAR 0114(0013)]
You just passed the first part of the Champion\nAssessment![VAR 0114(0013)]
On your first try too, no less! Don’t think\nanyone’s done that since Nemona.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Honestly I don’t know why you bungled it\nbefore...[VAR 0114(0013)]
But anyway, time to switch gears and get ready\nfor the next segment.[VAR 0114(0013)]
The second segment is what we call the Elite Test.[VAR 0114(0013)]
And you’ll be facing the Elite Four in Pokémon\nbattles![VAR 0114(0013)]
...I guess that’s pretty obvious from the name of\nthe test, huh.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Anyway, we’re the best the League has to offer.\nYou’ll be facing us four in a row—no turning back.[VAR 0114(0013)]
This won’t be a cakewalk—I promise you that.\nMake sure you’re all ready, then go into the\r\nroom behind me.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Once you’re ready for the Elite Test, go into\nthe room behind me.[VAR 0114(0013)]
There’s no turning back now!

You can’t go any farther until you win!
[~ 18]
Now then, let’s get this started, eh?[VAR 0114(0013)]
Let good ol’ Rika be the first of the Elite Four\nto take you on![VAR 0114(0013)]
I’d say I’ll go easy on you, but...I’d be lying!\nThink fast![VAR 0114(0013)]
Talk about unfair. No way was I ever gonna win\nthat one.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Still, though, what a great battle. Felt good even\nto lose![VAR 0114(0013)]
Not a whole lot of Trainers have the skill to make\nit past the Elite Test...\c\nBut who knows?[VAR 0114(0013)]
I’m beginning to think you might be one of the\nfew that do, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0013)]
Better stay on your toes, though—the second of\nthe Elite Four is stronger than me![VAR 0114(0013)]
You’re up next, squirt! Come on out![VAR 0114(0013)]
Cooomiiing![VAR 0114(0014)]
Oh wow! Did you lose, Rika?[VAR 0114(0014)]
Yeah, I did... [VAR 1100(00FF,0201)]HShe’s no pushover, let me tell you![VAR 0114(0013)]
I’ll be watching from the side. Avenge me if you\ncan, eh?[VAR 0114(0013)]
You bet I will![VAR 0114(0014)]
I’ll be watching to see just how far you make\nit, kiddo.[VAR 0114(0013)]

It’s so cool you made it this far! But this is where\nyou say bye-bye, mister![VAR 0114(0014)]
It’s so cool you made it this far! But this is where\nyou say bye-bye, miss![VAR 0114(0014)]
All my Pokémon are super tough![VAR 0114(0014)]
Your weak attacks won’t work on them at all!\nThey’ll bounce right off—you’ll see![VAR 0114(0014)]
I can’t wait for you to meet my friends, so...\nhere they come![VAR 0114(0014)]
Waaaaaah! Waaaaaah! I wanted to take revenge\non you, Rika![VAR 0114(0014)]
Pretty sure you mean “take revenge FOR” me,\nsquirt. Don’t think I did anything wrong by you.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Hate to say it, but you lost, Poppy. Better call the\nnext guy![VAR 0114(0013)]
Oh, that’s right! I haven’t had to do this in a\nlong time![VAR 0114(0014)]
It’s your turn, Mr. Larry![VAR 0114(0014)]
Hello there... It’s me, Larry.[VAR 0114(0015)]
That’s two of the Elite Four down—but you’ve\ngot another two to go, so hang in there![VAR 0114(0013)]

So, you made it this far.[VAR 0114(0015)]
I serve as a member of the Elite Four too, yes...\nUnfortunately for me.[VAR 0114(0015)]
At my Gym, I use Normal-type Pokémon, since\nI feel they have a lot in common with me.[VAR 0114(0015)]
But, well, the boss told me to use a different\ntype here.[VAR 0114(0015)]
So if you have any complaints, please take them\nup with La Primera.[VAR 0114(0015)]
Anyway, time to get to work.[VAR 0114(0015)]
You’re a lot stronger than I recall. No wonder\nLa Primera likes you.[VAR 0114(0015)]
Now then... I suppose the final member of the\nElite Four is next.[VAR 0114(0015)]
It’s your turn, Hassel...[VAR 0114(0015)]
Now, where could he be?[VAR 0114(0015)]
Uh... Don’t think he heard you, Larry.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Come on in, Hassel...[VAR 0114(0015)]
Larry, you...you may need to speak up just a\nlittle bit more.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Hassel...?[VAR 0114(0015)]
Haaasselll! You’re up next![VAR 0114(0013)]

As for you, Larry... I see you made Rika do the\nshouting again, hm?[VAR 0114(0012)]
... ... ...[VAR 0114(0015)]
Hassel’s the Elite Four’s last line of defense.\nI can’t wait to see how you’ll take him on![VAR 0114(0013)]
It’s super amazing you defeated Mr. Larry![VAR 0114(0014)]

I was, of course, absolutely certain you would\nmake it to me eventually.[VAR 0114(0012)]
Young sprouts truly do grow with astounding\nspeed, yes...[VAR 0114(0012)]
But I never for a moment imagined we would be\nfacing each other so soon![VAR 0114(0012)]
Now, a teacher’s duty is to guide students and\naid their growth.[VAR 0114(0012)]
But I think I shall forget about my role as a\nteacher for a moment...[VAR 0114(0012)]
and wield all my might for the sole purpose of\ndefeating you![VAR 0114(0012)]
I am Hassel, the dragon guarding the final\nfortress of the Elite Test.[VAR 0114(0012)]
Prepare to learn firsthand how the fiery breath\nof ferocious battle feels![VAR 0114(0012)]

Yeeeaaah! You’re tougher than steel![VAR 0114(0014)]
Yep.[VAR 0114(0015)]
Y-you did so BEAUDIFULLY![VAR 0114(0012)]
Congratulations![VAR 0114(0013)]
I’d say you’re good to go, but...there’s actually\njust a wee bit more to the Champion Assessment.[VAR 0114(0013)]
This’ll be your final trial.[VAR 0114(0013)]
See the door back there?[VAR 0114(0013)]
Our fearless commander—the final opponent\nyou’ll face for your test—is waiting beyond it.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Her skills are so amazing, she was able to\nstrong-arm all of us into joining the Elite Four.\c\nYou won’t find a mightier Champion.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Though I think you’ll do fine, kiddo! You beat\nme, after all![VAR 0114(0013)]
I’ll patch up your team—on the house—so don’t\nlose, you hear?[VAR 0114(0013)]
I really love your Pokémon, miss![VAR 0114(0014)]
I really love your Pokémon, mister![VAR 0114(0014)]
So I’ll cheer for you as hard as I can![VAR 0114(0014)]
Well, uh, good lu—[VAR 0114(0015)]
Even a baby dragon can breathe fire![VAR 0114(0012)]
Whoa! Guess you got over your sobs, huh?[VAR 0114(0013)]
You can do this. We all know you can.[VAR 0114(0012)]

Welcome, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0011)]
It gives me great joy that you’ve managed to\nmake it all the way to the pinnacle of the\r\nPokémon League.[VAR 0114(0011)]
The final test is a battle against me, the Top\nChampion.\c\nTo pass, all you need to do...is win.[VAR 0114(0011)]
But before we get started, I should apologize\nfor one thing.[VAR 0114(0011)]
You see, I have a trait that some might say is\ninappropriate for the League Chairwoman...[VAR 0114(0011)]
I am utterly incapable of holding back when it\ncomes to Pokémon battles.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Maybe that’s why nobody’s passed this test\nrecently. It’s a bit of a problem, to be honest.[VAR 0114(0011)]
But you... You might manage something\nwonderful, like Champion Nemona did.[VAR 0114(0011)]
So, are you ready for your final test?[VAR 0114(0011)]
I want to see the true measure of your talent![VAR 0114(0011)]
Such overwhelming power... Such amazing skill...[VAR 0114(0011)]
It seems Paldea has gained another wonderful\nTrainer to be proud of.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Congratulations. It’s my honor to call you\nChampion [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0011)]
“Congratulations” is right! Now I can really say\nyou’re good to go![VAR 0114(0013)]
Yaaay! You did it, mister![VAR 0114(0014)]
Yaaay! You did it, miss![VAR 0114(0014)]

You Pokémon Trainers are the treasure of Paldea.[VAR 0114(0011)]
And amid that treasure, Champions are the\njewels that shine brightest.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Champion [VAR 0100(0000)]...[VAR 0114(0011)]
It is now your duty to set an example for all of\nthe Trainers of Paldea.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Now, allow me to walk you back to the entrance.[VAR 0114(0011)]

[VAR BD06(0000)]There I go getting overexcited again! Sorry,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]\r\nand\r\n[VAR 0101(0001)].[VAR 0114(0004)]
I also must ask—is this roadside really the setting\nyou two want for your first battle as true equals\r\nand rivals?[VAR 0114(0011)]
Hmm... Now that you mention it, that’s a\ngood point.[VAR 0114(0004)]
In that case, can we use one of the Pokémon\nLeague battle courts?[VAR 0114(0004)]
Surely there’s somewhere more fitting. A place\nwith special meaning for the two of you, perhaps.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Special meaning, huh? Hmm... Let me see...\nAnywhere leap to mind, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0004)]
Out behind your house
Mesagoza
The Treasure Eatery
Haha! Our beach out back, huh? Yeah, the place\nwhere we had our first battle might work.[VAR 0114(0004)]
But on the other hand, to me it’s just kind of...\nmy backyard, y’know? A little ordinary.[VAR 0114(0004)]
Anyplace else come to mind?[VAR 0114(0004)]
The Treasure Eatery? Is it significant to the two of\nyou somehow?[VAR 0114(0011)]
Ah, are you thinking of it ’cause it’s got the\nMedali Gym’s battle court?\c\nI guess it does bring back memories...of Larry...[VAR 0114(0004)]
Larry may not appreciate the surprise visit.\c\nIf you’ve any other suitable places in mind, would\nyou prioritize them instead, please?[VAR 0114(0011)]
Mesagoza? Oooh, good call! The place where we\nset out on our journey![VAR 0114(0004)]
That reminds me, [VAR 0100(0000)]...\c\nRemember back when Director Clavell explained\nthe [VAR FF00(0006)]Treasure Hunt[VAR FF00(0000)]? Y’know how he told us to go\r\nin search of our own treasure?[VAR 0114(0004)]
Well, I know what treasure I got out of all this:\nI found a true rival—someone who can stand up\r\nto me at my full capabilities.[VAR 0114(0004)]
That’s right—I mean you! I’m so glad I got to\nmeet you, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0004)]
Anyway, that being said...[VAR 0114(0004)]
I’ll be waiting for you at the battle court in\nMesagoza’s central plaza! See ya there![VAR 0114(0004)]
The respect you two share is palpable. Even a bit\nenviable, to be honest.[VAR 0114(0011)]
I am known as La Primera—but even when facing\nme in the final test of her Champion Assessment,\r\nChampion Nemona didn’t reveal her full might.[VAR 0114(0011)]
In you, I suspect she has found someone she can\nbattle without holding anything back.[VAR 0114(0011)]

You ready for a battle between Champions?[VAR 0114(0004)]
’Cause all these folks here seem ready to watch.\nWord got around, I guess![VAR 0114(0004)]
And out of every single person gathered here...[VAR 0114(0004)]
I’m the most excited by a mile![VAR 0114(0004)]

It’s my all-out power...[VAR 0114(0004)]

This is legit incredible! You’re the strongest out\nthere, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0004)]
I mean, you knocked me flat, and I was giving\nyou absolutely everything I had![VAR 0114(0004)]
Everything I...[VAR 0114(0004)]
I...[VAR 0114(0004)]
Ha haaa! Hahaha![VAR 0114(0004)]
Oh man. Pokémon battling, am I right?[VAR 0114(0004)]
It’s so much better—so much more fun than I ever\neven knew![VAR 0114(0004)]
Thanks for that incredible match. You beat me\nfor real this time![VAR 0114(0004)]
Now let’s give ourselves a minute and have a\nquick break, [VAR 0100(0000)]...[VAR 0114(0004)]

Hello, hello. My name’s Jacq, and I’ll be your\nPokémon biology teacher.[VAR 0114(002A)]
In my class, we’ll all learn about the various\nquirks of our beloved Pokémon together![VAR 0114(002A)]
I hope you all come to love Pokémon even more\nfrom the things you learn here.[VAR 0114(002A)]
In today’s class, I’ll teach you a great way to\nget to know Pokémon in more depth.[VAR 0114(002A)]
If you’d like to become better friends with your\nPokémon...[VAR 0114(002A)]
you can let them come out of their Poké Ball\nand walk along with you! Sounds great, huh?[VAR 0114(002A)]
You can use the [VAR FF00(0006)]ZR Button[VAR FF00(0000)] to throw a Poké Ball\nand let out the Pokémon inside.\c\nNothing cuter than watching your Pokémon run\naround underfoot, if you ask me.[VAR 0114(002A)]
Once you let your Pokémon out, try speaking to\nthem—they’re sure to respond in some way.\r\nIt’s a great way to get to know them better![VAR 0114(002A)]
However! Letting your Pokémon out of its ball\nisn’t such a great idea in some locations.\c\nCan anyone tell me where it is that you shouldn’t\nhave your Pokémon walk along with you?[VAR 0114(002A)]
Near the water
Inside buildings
In tall grass
It’s certainly true that some Pokémon aren’t fond\nof water, but we do have floating platforms they\r\ncan use, so being near water isn’t an issue.[VAR 0114(002A)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]That’s right! Great job, [VAR 0100(0000)].\nI see\r\nyou\r\ndid\r\nyour\r\nhomework.[VAR 0114(002A)]
Pokémon love tall grass! I can’t see them having\nany problem walking with you there.[VAR 0114(002A)]
The correct answer is that we should not walk\nwith our Pokémon indoors. How about that![VAR 0114(002A)]
Some Pokémon might damage walls, desks, and\nother things walking around inside buildings, so\r\nit’s not allowed regardless of the species.[VAR 0114(002A)]
Therefore, please only let your Pokémon out of\ntheir Poké Balls while outdoors. OK, everyone?\c\nI think I see them out and about in classrooms\nfrom time to time, but still...[VAR 0114(002A)]
Anyway, you may become even closer friends\nwith your Pokémon pals by walking together![VAR 0114(002A)]
Oh! I almost forgot—keep in mind that you can\nonly walk together with your lead Pokémon.[VAR 0114(002A)]
Remember—use the [VAR FF00(0006)]ZR Button[VAR FF00(0000)] to throw a ball\nand let out the Pokémon inside.\c\nYou’ll also want to remember that throwing a\nball at a wild Pokémon will start a battle![VAR 0114(002A)]
It looks like that’s all the time we have for today.\nSee you all next class![VAR 0114(002A)]

Hello, hello. I hope everyone’s ready to learn\nsome new things today![VAR 0114(002A)]
Did you all try using the ZR Button to let your\nPokémon out as I taught you in our last class?[VAR 0114(002A)]
Walking along with your Pokémon lets you see\nhow unique and cute they all are.[VAR 0114(002A)]
I’d also highly recommend picnics for when you\nwant to spend some quality time together with\r\nthe Pokémon in your party.[VAR 0114(002A)]
You can get them all around the table to make\nsandwiches and play—it’s really a lot of fun![VAR 0114(002A)]
If you want to learn more about making food,\nMr. Saguaro’s class is the best place to go![VAR 0114(002A)]
Now, sometimes, while you’re enjoying a picnic\nwith your Pokémon...[VAR 0114(002A)]
you may find something very, VERY important in\nthe basket next to your table![VAR 0114(002A)]
This very important something is what Pokémon\nare born from. Let’s all say it together![VAR 0114(002A)]
Boxes!
Poké Balls!
Eggs!
[VAR BD06(0000)]Huh? Um...[VAR 0100(0000)], it looks\nlike\r\nyou’re\r\nthe\r\nonly\r\none\r\nwho\r\nsaid Boxes.\c\nWe sometimes send Pokémon to Boxes for\nsafekeeping, but they’re not born from them![VAR 0114(002A)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Huh? Um...[VAR 0100(0000)], it looks\nlike\r\nyou’re\r\nthe\r\nonly\r\none\r\nwho\r\nsaid\r\nPoké Balls!\c\nI don’t believe there have been any Pokémon\ndiscovered yet that are born from Poké Balls![VAR 0114(002A)]
Phew! You all got it right![VAR 0114(002A)]
The very important something I’m talking about\nis...a Pokémon Egg![VAR 0114(002A)]
It’s not clear where these Eggs come from, but\nthey’re probably placed in the basket rather\r\nstealthily by the Pokémon at the picnic.[VAR 0114(002A)]
Walking around with an Egg will help warm it,\nwhich allows it to hatch.[VAR 0114(002A)]
Eggs won’t warm up by sitting in Boxes, though.\nYou need to have them in your party![VAR 0114(002A)]
And here’s one more super important thing I’d\nlike you to remember about Eggs.[VAR 0114(002A)]
Pokémon entrust us with their Eggs because they\nbelieve in us![VAR 0114(002A)]
So, I sure would be happy to see you all being\nresponsible parents for your little Pokémon Eggs![VAR 0114(002A)]
Whoops. My most important point came right as\nthe bell rang. Well, see you all next time, I guess![VAR 0114(002A)]

Hello, hello. I hope everyone’s ready to learn\nsome new things today![VAR 0114(002A)]
I seem to remember teaching you all about the\nimportance of Eggs in our last class together.[VAR 0114(002A)]
Ah, on that note, is everyone using their\nPokédex?[VAR 0114(002A)]
It registers Pokémon born from Eggs as well as\nthose encountered via other methods, so don’t\r\nyou worry about that![VAR 0114(002A)]
And, uh, hehe...just so you know, I’m the one who\ndeveloped the Pokédex app![VAR 0114(002A)]
It was waaay before I started teaching here at the\nacademy, though.[VAR 0114(002A)]
Back then, I was a researcher.[VAR 0114(002A)]
In fact, Director Clavell wasn’t working in\neducation at the time, either!\c\nHe was researching alongside me at the\nsame facility.[VAR 0114(002A)]
We got to research Pokémon together day in,\nday out... Those sure were fun times.\c\nI got yelled at all the time, though. Heh.[VAR 0114(002A)]
Wait a second, how did I get onto this?\nPretty sure I was talking about the Pokédex...[VAR 0114(002A)]
Uh... Anyway! Today, I’d like to teach you about\ncatching Pokémon.[VAR 0114(002A)]
As you all know, a great way to catch a Pokémon\nmore easily is to first lower its HP.[VAR 0114(002A)]
But there’s another way to up your chances of a\nsuccessful catch. Can you guess what it is?[VAR 0114(002A)]
Give the Pokémon a Berry
Inflict the Pokémon with a status condition
Prove you’re stronger than the Pokémon
Huh? Hmmm... Maybe that’s a bit of advice from\nanother region?\c\nThe common understanding here in Paldea may\nbe a little different.[VAR 0114(002A)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Wow! That’s right, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nGreat job![VAR 0114(002A)]
That’s a rough-and-tumble way to look at things,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]...\c\nI guess it’s true that sending out a strong\nPokémon can turn a battle in your favor, though.[VAR 0114(002A)]
The correct technique for making Pokémon easier\nto catch is to inflict them with a status condition.[VAR 0114(002A)]
Sleep is an especially effective status condition.\nIt makes Pokémon drastically easier to catch![VAR 0114(002A)]
If you have a Pokémon that can use moves that\nput opponents to sleep, like Sleep Powder or\r\nHypnosis, filling up your Pokédex will be a cinch![VAR 0114(002A)]
There are other ways to improve your catch rate\nas well, like using Poké Balls specifically designed\r\nto be effective against certain Pokémon.[VAR 0114(002A)]
Eating food that gives you Catching Power works,\ntoo—or sneaking up on Pokémon from behind to\r\ncatch them by surprise when you start a battle![VAR 0114(002A)]
If you’re having trouble, you may want to make\nthe rounds to the Gyms to get Gym Badges.[VAR 0114(002A)]
Earning Gym Badges will make it easier to catch\nPokémon of higher and higher levels![VAR 0114(002A)]
Please do come show me your Pokédexes once\nthey start to fill up![VAR 0114(002A)]
Another day, another enjoyable class. Oh yeah,\ndon’t forget—our next class will be a test![VAR 0114(002A)]

It’s easy to use!
It’s all right
I don’t use it that much...
All right, everyone! Time’s up! I hope you all\nenjoyed tackling those questions![VAR 0114(002A)]
That last question was just something that I’m\npersonally curious to know.\c\nDon’t tell the director about it, OK?[VAR 0114(002A)]
I’ll grade these right away. I hope you’re all\nlooking forward to seeing how you did![VAR 0114(002A)]

Hello, hello. I hope everyone’s ready to learn\nsome new things today![VAR 0114(002A)]
You all did really great on the midterm exam![VAR 0114(002A)]
Thanks for answering my little question at the\nend, too.\c\nI’ll be sure to keep your responses in mind.[VAR 0114(002A)]
All right! We’re now heading into the last half\nof our classes together.[VAR 0114(002A)]
It’s time for our knowledge to evolve and grow—\njust like our Pokémon![VAR 0114(002A)]
Evolution...yep. Haha! Evolution![VAR 0114(002A)]
Today we’re going to learn about the fascinating\nphenomenon of Pokémon Evolution![VAR 0114(002A)]
As your Pokémon battle and level up, they learn\nmoves and get stronger.[VAR 0114(002A)]
And for some Pokémon, once they’ve leveled up\nenough...[VAR 0114(002A)]
their appearance changes, and their stats\nincrease—sometimes by a lot![VAR 0114(002A)]
That’s Pokémon Evolution![VAR 0114(002A)]
Pokémon become very strong when they evolve,\nmaking them trusty partners in battle.[VAR 0114(002A)]
But! Some people prefer to keep their Pokémon\nin their adorable pre-evolved states.[VAR 0114(002A)]
To do this, you just need to remember a certain\nbutton when your Pokémon begins to evolve.[VAR 0114(002A)]
Say it with me if you already know! To cancel\nEvolution, press the...[VAR 0114(002A)]
A Button!
B Button!
C Button!
[VAR BD06(0000)]Huh? Um...[VAR 0100(0000)], you may\nbe\r\nthinking\r\nof\r\nsomething else.\c\nThe A Button has more of a decisive feel to it.\nKinda like “A-OK!” don’t you think?[VAR 0114(002A)]
That’s right, everyone! “B” for “best answer!”[VAR 0114(002A)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Huh? Um...[VAR 0100(0000)], you may\nbe\r\nthinking\r\nof\r\nsomething else.\c\nThe C Button... That has a bit of a nostalgic feel\nto it, don’t you think?[VAR 0114(002A)]
The button you want when you need to stop a\nPokémon from evolving is the B Button![VAR 0114(002A)]
If you press this button soon after a Pokémon\nbegins to evolve, you can stop it from changing.[VAR 0114(002A)]
You can also let the Pokémon hold an item known\nas an Everstone to keep it from evolving.[VAR 0114(002A)]
And keep in mind that the requirements for\nEvolution differ from Pokémon to Pokémon.[VAR 0114(002A)]
Some may evolve by having a certain item, such\nas a Fire Stone or Thunder Stone, used on them.\c\nOthers may have to learn a specific move or\ndefeat a specific Pokémon in battle to evolve.[VAR 0114(002A)]
The way Primeape evolves into Annihilape is\nespecially strange.[VAR 0114(002A)]
You see, there’s a certain move that—[VAR 0114(002A)]
Whoops. Sorry, looks like we’re out of time![VAR 0114(002A)]
I guess we’ll have to end the class there today.\nThank you all for your attention![VAR 0114(002A)]

Hello, hello. I hope everyone’s ready to learn\nsome new things today![VAR 0114(002A)]
But before we get going, do you all remember\nthe final question from our midterm exam?[VAR 0114(002A)]
Well, Director Clavell found out about it\nsomehow, and I got yelled at. Whoops.[VAR 0114(002A)]
Apparently he could tell I was hiding something\njust by looking at me.[VAR 0114(002A)]
He must’ve noticed all the color flush right out of\nmy face! Haha![VAR 0114(002A)]
Speaking of color, today I’d like to teach you\nall about colors as they pertain to Pokémon![VAR 0114(002A)]
Some Pokémon have slightly different coloration\nor patterning on their bodies based on their\r\ngender or individual differences.[VAR 0114(002A)]
In very rare cases, a Pokémon may have wildly\ndifferent coloration compared to others of the\r\nsame species.[VAR 0114(002A)]
We call these specimens [VAR FF00(0006)]Shiny [VAR FF00(0000)]Pokémon.[VAR 0114(002A)]
It is quite rare to cross paths with one.[VAR 0114(002A)]
Does anyone here know what the likelihood of\nfinding a Shiny Pokémon is?[VAR 0114(002A)]
1 in 40
1 in 400
1 in 4,000
It would be nice if they were that common! We\nwould be able to do far more research on them.\r\nBut they’re actually quite a bit more rare.[VAR 0114(002A)]
That’s not a bad guess. But they’re actually\neven rarer than 1 in 400![VAR 0114(002A)]
Wow! That’s right! You may have the makings of a\nPokémon Professor, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(002A)]
Shiny Pokémon appear at a rate of 1 in 4,000.\nIsn’t that amazing?[VAR 0114(002A)]
The probability of encountering one in the wild is\nthe same as hatching one from an Egg, too![VAR 0114(002A)]
Eggs from a pair of Pokémon raised around\ndiffering languages are a special case.[VAR 0114(002A)]
There is a higher than average chance that\na Shiny Pokémon will hatch from these Eggs.[VAR 0114(002A)]
But we haven’t been able to figure out why that is\njust yet.[VAR 0114(002A)]
I’ve also heard rumors of a charm that increases\nyour likelihood of finding Shiny Pokémon when\r\nyou have it in your Bag—can you believe that?![VAR 0114(002A)]
This claim can’t be scientifically verified, but it\nsure would be fun if it were true.[VAR 0114(002A)]
Whoops...there’s the bell.[VAR 0114(002A)]
That’s all for today. Thank you for your attention![VAR 0114(002A)]

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Hello, hello. I hope everyone’s ready to learn\nsome new things today![VAR 0114(002A)]
Next time we meet, we’ll have our final exam.\nThat means today is our last actual class.[VAR 0114(002A)]
And the topic for this last class will be...Pokémon\n[VAR FF00(0006)]forms[VAR FF00(0000)]! You can just think of forms as the shapes\r\nor appearances that Pokémon have.[VAR 0114(002A)]
There’s also a phenomenon called a [VAR FF00(0006)]form[VAR FF00(0000)]\n[VAR FF00(0006)]change[VAR FF00(0000)], where a Pokémon’s appearance\r\nchanges under certain conditions.[VAR 0114(002A)]
Cyclizar, for example, which we regularly ride on\nas transportation here in Paldea, has three forms.[VAR 0114(002A)]
First is its basic form, where it walks on four\nlegs. Second is its battle form, where it stands\r\non its hind legs to engage in battle.[VAR 0114(002A)]
Finally, there’s its ride form, where it inflates its\nthroat sac and its tail so we can ride on its back.[VAR 0114(002A)]
Though we can use something you’re all carrying\nwith you now as an even better example![VAR 0114(002A)]
Yup, I’m talking about your phones! Some\nsmartphones are inhabited by a certain Pokémon.[VAR 0114(002A)]
Does anyone know the Pokémon I’m referring to?[VAR 0114(002A)]
Rotom
Pikachu
Heracross
You’re a regular expert on Pokémon AND\ntechnology, aren’t you, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(002A)]
It sure would be adorable if it were Pikachu in\nour phones—and it would probably make us want\r\nto walk around more, too!\c\nBut too bad, that’s not the right answer![VAR 0114(002A)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Haha! I see where you’re coming from,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nHeracross can learn a move called Smart Strike!\nSmartphone, Smart Strike... Well, unfortunately,\r\nthere’s no connection![VAR 0114(002A)]
The Pokémon inside your smartphone is Rotom,\nand it does all sorts of things to help you out.[VAR 0114(002A)]
A Rotom inside a Rotom Phone is special, so it\ndoesn’t try to enter other electronics.[VAR 0114(002A)]
An ordinary Rotom, however, can change form by\nentering washing machines, microwave ovens,\r\nand other electronic appliances.[VAR 0114(002A)]
Rotom is a bit of an exception, though. Many\nPokémon that change form do so simply by\r\nholding an item or by having one used on them.[VAR 0114(002A)]
Oricorio, for example, has four different forms it\ncan change between when given certain nectars.[VAR 0114(002A)]
Pokémon may even change type or learn\ndifferent moves when they change form.[VAR 0114(002A)]
Form changes are different from Evolution in that\nthe Pokémon can return to its original form.\c\nAnd unlike Shiny Pokémon, which can’t change\ntheir special coloration, the same individual\r\nPokémon can go back and forth between\r\nits forms.[VAR 0114(002A)]
There’s a lot to dig into with this form change\nphenomenon, as you can see![VAR 0114(002A)]
We can all learn something from Pokémon\nhere, don’t you think? Bit of a stretch, but...[VAR 0114(002A)]
I’d be happy to see you all enjoy your time at\nthe academy to the fullest...and change form\r\ninto a new version of yourselves![VAR 0114(002A)]
Or something like that, anyway![VAR 0114(002A)]
Oh! I almost forgot![VAR 0114(002A)]
Regional forms, which vary based on what region\na Pokémon came from, don’t change like other\r\nforms. They’re an innate—[VAR 0114(002A)]
Whoops. Heh...there’s the bell.[VAR 0114(002A)]
I guess I was scatterbrained Mr. Jacq right up to\nthe very end, huh?\c\nI had a great time teaching all of you. I hope\nyou’ll do your best on the final exam![VAR 0114(002A)]

—This question won’t affect your grade!—\n\nDo you have anything you would like to say\nabout my class? I’m still getting used to this\nteaching thing, but I sure had fun as your teacher!
It was fun!
Thank you for being our teacher!
Keep teaching! You can do it!
OK! Time’s up whether you like it or not! I hope\neveryone enjoyed tackling those questions![VAR 0114(002A)]
Hehe... I snuck in a little bonus question there\nright at the end again. Shhh, our little secret—\r\ndon’t tell the director![VAR 0114(002A)]
I’ll grade these right away. I hope you’re all\nlooking forward to seeing how you did![VAR 0114(002A)]

Hello, everyone. Nice to meet you. My name’s\nTyme, and I will be your math teacher.[VAR 0114(0025)]
Sorry to put you all on the spot at the start of\nclass, but let me ask you a quick question—\r\nDo you enjoy numbers, arithmetic, and the like?[VAR 0114(0025)]
Yeah!
Sort of.
Errr...
Oh, my. Hahaha. Thank you for your honest\nresponses.[VAR 0114(0025)]
Some of you may like numbers, and some may\nnot. I think that makes a wonderful mix.[VAR 0114(0025)]
But no matter your opinion on math, I hope you\nfind yourselves enjoying our lessons together!\c\nI’ll do my best to find a good way to match up\nyour interests with all types of math lessons![VAR 0114(0025)]
Speaking of which, are you all caught up on your\nstudies of Pokémon type matchups?[VAR 0114(0025)]
For example, Grass is strong against Water, and\nWater is strong against Fire, correct?[VAR 0114(0025)]
[VAR BD06(0000)][VAR 0100(0000)], you seem to\nbe\r\ngood\r\nwith\r\nPokémon,\r\nso\r\nlet\r\nme\r\nask\r\nyou this...[VAR 0114(0025)]
Bearing in mind that Water is strong against Fire...\nIf the move Water Gun hits a Fire-type Pokémon,\r\nwhat becomes of the move’s damage?[VAR 0114(0025)]
It’s cut in half
It doesn’t change
It’s doubled
Oh, my. A little reverse thinking, I see! But I’d\nprobably be in rough shape afterward if I got hit\r\nby something I was weak to. Wouldn’t you be?[VAR 0114(0025)]
A real hardy individual, I see! But I’d probably\nbe in rough shape afterward if I got hit by\r\nsomething I was weak to. Wouldn’t you be?[VAR 0114(0025)]
That’s right! I knew I could count on you for this\nquestion, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0025)]
Using moves of a type that your opponent is\nweak to is a supereffective tactic!\c\nIt multiplies the damage of those moves by two![VAR 0114(0025)]
On the other hand, using moves of a type that\nyour opponent is resistant to isn’t very effective.\r\nIt divides the damage of your moves by two.[VAR 0114(0025)]
Haha! I don’t mean to encroach on Ms. Dendra’s\nbattle studies territory, of course, but I thought\r\nit best to use a lively topic as an example.[VAR 0114(0025)]
That can make math fun even for those of you\nwho don’t much like the subject, don’t you think?[VAR 0114(0025)]
Oh, my. Is that the bell? I suppose that’s all for\nnow. What a shame...[VAR 0114(0025)]
I’m looking forward to seeing you all in the next\nclass. I hope you’re looking forward to it, too![VAR 0114(0025)]

Hello, everyone. Let’s have a fun class today.[VAR 0114(0025)]
Tell me, do you all enjoy shopping?[VAR 0114(0025)]
Buying tasty bread or choosing new clothes—\neven just window shopping is so much fun![VAR 0114(0025)]
In today’s class, I’d like to use shopping—one of\nmy own favorite hobbies, mind you—to teach\r\nyou all about math![VAR 0114(0025)]
I’m sure everyone here has visited a Poké Mart at\nleast once. They sell all sorts of Pokémon items![VAR 0114(0025)]
Poké Balls are one of the many useful items you\ncan find there. They cost 200 each.[VAR 0114(0025)]
Now then, I’d like you all to do some thinking\nwith me here![VAR 0114(0025)]
One Poké Ball is 200. If you had 2,000 and\nbought as many Poké Balls as you could afford,\r\nhow many would you receive?[VAR 0114(0025)]
Nine
Ten
Eleven
[VAR BD06(0000)]Oh, my. That guess falls a little short,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0025)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Oh dear. I’m sorry, [VAR 0100(0000)].\nI suppose\r\nthis\r\nwas\r\na bit\r\nof a\r\ntrick question.[VAR 0114(0025)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]That’s correct! Well done,\n[VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0025)]
With 2,000, you can afford to purchase a\nmaximum of 10 Poké Balls...[VAR 0114(0025)]
However! If you purchase 10 or more of any one\ntype of Poké Ball...[VAR 0114(0025)]
You will also receive one Premier Ball—a special\nwhite ball—as a bonus![VAR 0114(0025)]
So the correct answer is, in fact, 11![VAR 0114(0025)]
It sure is nice to get a little bonus like that on a\nshopping trip, isn’t it?[VAR 0114(0025)]
Oh, my. Is that the bell? I suppose that’s all for\nnow. What a shame...[VAR 0114(0025)]
I’m looking forward to seeing you all in the next\nclass. I hope you’re looking forward to it, too![VAR 0114(0025)]

Hello, everyone. Let’s have a fun class today.[VAR 0114(0025)]
Tell me, do you all enjoy fortune telling,\nhoroscopes, and the like?[VAR 0114(0025)]
I think it feels great to read your horoscope and\nsee that it says good luck is coming your way.[VAR 0114(0025)]
So today, I’d like to teach you all math while\nfocusing on the topic of luck![VAR 0114(0025)]
Perhaps you have seen the following phrase\ncrop up during Pokémon battles before...\c\n“A critical hit!”[VAR 0114(0025)]
When a Pokémon’s attack lands as a critical hit,\nthe damage it deals is increased by half.\c\nIn other words, it does one-and-a-half times as\nmuch damage as it normally would![VAR 0114(0025)]
It is truly luck that determines whether your\nPokémon lands a critical hit—or has one landed\r\non it. This can cause a great upset in battle.[VAR 0114(0025)]
Does anyone know what percent chance a\nPokémon has of landing a critical hit?[VAR 0114(0025)]
About 1 percent (1 in 100 hits)
About 4 percent (4 in 100 hits)
About 12 percent (12 in 100 hits)
Oh, my. Critical hits land a little more often than\nthat, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0025)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]That is correct! Well done,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0025)]
Oh, my. That might cause a bit TOO critical of a\nsituation, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0025)]
The chance of landing a critical hit is said to be\n1 in 24...which figures to roughly 4.17 percent.[VAR 0114(0025)]
The odds are more favorable for certain moves,\nthough—why, moves such as Stone Edge and\r\nShadow Claw have about a 12 percent chance![VAR 0114(0025)]
You can also use a move called Focus Energy or\nan item known as a Dire Hit.[VAR 0114(0025)]
Both raise the critical-hit ratio by two stages—\nthat’s a 50 percent chance to land a critical hit![VAR 0114(0025)]
It feels great to land a critical hit, but perhaps\nnot so great to be struck by one![VAR 0114(0025)]
There is a surprising amount of mathematical\nprobability hidden in Pokémon battles, you know.[VAR 0114(0025)]
If you’re able to do the calculations that’ll swing\nluck in your favor, it may open the door for more\r\nstrategic choices for you during battle.[VAR 0114(0025)]
Oh, my. Is that the bell? I suppose that’s all for\nnow. What a shame...[VAR 0114(0025)]
Next class will be our fun midterm exam! I hope\nyou’ll all be looking forward to it.[VAR 0114(0025)]

Text File : class_b_05
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Hello, everyone. Well done on the midterm exam.[VAR 0114(0025)]
Some of you earned perfect scores, and others\nseemed to have a bit of trouble, but I can tell\r\nthat you all tried your best.[VAR 0114(0025)]
I am quite pleased to say that every last one of\nyou passed.[VAR 0114(0025)]
I can only assume that this means you have all\ncome to love numbers![VAR 0114(0025)]
Stay sharp, and try your best for the rest of my\nclasses, too![VAR 0114(0025)]
Speaking of staying “sharp,” do you know how\nthat word applies to Pokémon battles?\r\nThat’s right—it has to do with stat boosts![VAR 0114(0025)]
A Pokémon’s stats can rise and fall throughout\nthe course of battle, correct?[VAR 0114(0025)]
For example, if a Pokémon uses the move\nWork Up, its Attack and Sp. Atk stats will rise by\r\none stage each.[VAR 0114(0025)]
And, as you may know, each time a Pokémon’s\nAttack or Sp. Atk rises one stage, moves affected\r\nby that stat will deal 50 percent more damage.[VAR 0114(0025)]
If that same Pokémon from our previous example\nwere to use Work Up again, both its Attack and\r\nSp. Atk will have risen by two stages total.\c\nThis results in a 100 percent increase to damage\ndealt, making its moves twice as strong![VAR 0114(0025)]
Swords Dance, on the other hand, boosts Attack\nby two stages at once, allowing the Pokémon to\r\ndeal double damage after just a single use![VAR 0114(0025)]
Using Swords Dance twice would boost the\nPokémon’s Attack stat by four stages. How much\r\nmore damage, then, would this Pokémon deal?[VAR 0114(0025)]
Double damage
Triple damage
Quadruple damage
Ah, yes. This question is a tricky one, isn’t it?\c\nDamage would be doubled if it’d used Work Up\ntwice, but we’re talking about Swords Dance.[VAR 0114(0025)]
Wow, that’s great! You answered this difficult\nquestion with ease, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0025)]
Ah, yes. This question is a tricky one, isn’t it?\c\nJust because it boosts the Pokémon’s stat by four\nstages doesn’t mean damage is quadrupled.[VAR 0114(0025)]
Each stage that a Pokémon’s Attack or Sp. Atk\nstat is raised increases its damage by 50 percent.[VAR 0114(0025)]
So, being raised four stages would result in a four\ntimes 50 percent—or 200 percent—increase.[VAR 0114(0025)]
The base damage of a move is 100 percent, so\nadding 200 percent to that gives us 300 percent.[VAR 0114(0025)]
In other words, the next move the Pokémon uses\nwill deal triple damage.[VAR 0114(0025)]
Type matchups, critical-hit damage, and other\nfactors all play into these calculations as well,\r\nso even a small boost must be taken seriously.[VAR 0114(0025)]
By the way, if a stat simply “rose,” that means it\nhas gone up by one stage.\c\nIf it “rose sharply,” that’s two stages.\c\nAnd if it “rose drastically,” that’s three stages.[VAR 0114(0025)]
Just so you know, the X Attack and X Sp. Atk\nitems, which can only be used in battle, can be\r\nused to sharply boost those respective stats.[VAR 0114(0025)]
Oh, my. Is that the bell? I suppose that’s all for\nnow. What a shame...[VAR 0114(0025)]
Today’s lesson was a little difficult, so be sure to\nreview what you learned in order to stay “sharp”!\r\nI’ll see you all again next class.[VAR 0114(0025)]

Text File : class_b_06
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Hello, everyone. Let’s have a fun class today.[VAR 0114(0025)]
Did you make sure to review last class’s material\nin order to stay “sharp”?[VAR 0114(0025)]
I know it was a little difficult with all that talk of\nmultiplication and percentages and the like.[VAR 0114(0025)]
But today, we’ll be talking about percentages\nagain to learn about probability.[VAR 0114(0025)]
That may sound like we’re going to have another\ndifficult class, but did you know that all of you\r\nalready deal with probability on a regular basis?[VAR 0114(0025)]
Pokémon moves generally have a property called\naccuracy, which determines the probability that\r\nthey will hit.[VAR 0114(0025)]
The accuracy of Tackle is 100—or 100 percent.\nSo if you were to use Tackle 100 times, you\r\ncould expect it to hit all 100 times![VAR 0114(0025)]
The move Hypnosis, which puts opponents to\nsleep, has an accuracy of 60—or 60 percent.[VAR 0114(0025)]
That means you could expect it to hit 60 times\nin 100 uses. To put that another way—out of 100\r\nuses, you could expect it to miss 40 times![VAR 0114(0025)]
Many of the truly powerful moves often tend to\nhave lower accuracy.[VAR 0114(0025)]
So when you’re deciding whether to go slow and\nsteady with moves that are sure to hit, or hard\r\nand fast with stronger but less accurate moves...[VAR 0114(0025)]
you’re already studying probability![VAR 0114(0025)]
Let me see here... Perhaps Surf and Hydro Pump\nwould be good examples for this discussion?[VAR 0114(0025)]
Surf has a power of 90. Its accuracy is 100,\nmeaning you can expect it to hit every time.[VAR 0114(0025)]
Hydro Pump’s accuracy is only 80—but when it\nhits, its power is 110![VAR 0114(0025)]
So, between Surf and Hydro Pump, which move\nwould you want to use yourselves?[VAR 0114(0025)]
I’d use Surf
I’d use Hydro Pump
It depends on the situation
Oh my. I see it’s “slow and steady wins the race”\nfor you, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0025)]
Oh my. I see you like the risky, adventurous side\nof things, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0025)]
Oh my. I see you’re always considering various\npossibilities, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0025)]
I may have made it sound like there was a correct\nanswer here, but there’s not!\c\nYou’re free to use any moves you wish![VAR 0114(0025)]
Factors like PP or number of targets hit may make\nsome moves more suited to certain situations.\c\nHowever, trading accuracy for power or vice\nversa is purely a matter of preference![VAR 0114(0025)]
This Surf-versus-Hydro Pump debate has been\nongoing for quite some time.[VAR 0114(0025)]
Personally, I’m more invested in debating the\nRock-type moves Rock Slide and Stone Edge.[VAR 0114(0025)]
Let me tell you, I could get really worked up\ntalking about those moves, but—\c\nOh, my. There’s the bell. What a shame.[VAR 0114(0025)]
Next class will be the last of our time together,\nso show up 100 percent ready to go![VAR 0114(0025)]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Text File : class_b_07
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Hello, everyone. I hope we can have fun once\nagain today for our last class together.[VAR 0114(0025)]
Last time we learned about probability, using\nmove accuracy as an example.[VAR 0114(0025)]
Probability is quite an interesting subject. Did\nyou know that, in a class with 40 students, there\r\nis a 90 percent chance that two of them will have\r\nthe same birthday?[VAR 0114(0025)]
This is true even despite the fact that there are\nover 300 days each year. Isn’t that remarkable?[VAR 0114(0025)]
But let’s move on to today’s topic before we\nget swept along with probability again.[VAR 0114(0025)]
I’ve been teaching you all how to calculate\ndamage in this class using examples like type\r\nmatchups, critical hits, stat boosts, and the like.[VAR 0114(0025)]
All of these variables are multiplied together to\ncalculate damage dealt to an opponent.[VAR 0114(0025)]
However, did you know that there is an even\nsimpler way to increase the damage of your\r\nPokémon’s moves?[VAR 0114(0025)]
All you have to do is have your Pokémon use\na move it shares a type with![VAR 0114(0025)]
If a Rock-type Pokémon uses the Rock-type move\nStone Edge, the move’s base power of 100 is\r\nmultiplied by 1.5 to become 150.[VAR 0114(0025)]
Ground and Rock may seem like similar types,\nbut if a Ground-type Pokémon uses Stone Edge,\r\nthe move’s power will remain 100.[VAR 0114(0025)]
Supereffective moves and critical hits also add\nmultipliers on to this little numerical increase,\r\nso it most certainly must not be taken lightly.[VAR 0114(0025)]
Let me ask you a question to see if you\nunderstand what I’m talking about here.[VAR 0114(0025)]
Say you have a move with a power of 100. If a\nPokémon that shares a type with this move\r\nuses it and hits an opponent that is weak to\r\nthat type, what happens to that move’s power?[VAR 0114(0025)]
Its power becomes 150
Its power becomes 200
Its power becomes 300
Close! But a power of 150 would only take into\naccount the multiplier of 1.5 resulting from the\r\nPokémon sharing a type with the move.[VAR 0114(0025)]
Close! But a power of 200 would only take into\naccount the doubling effect of using a move\r\nthat is super effective against an opponent.[VAR 0114(0025)]
You did that calculation all in your head? Well\ndone, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0025)]
First, using a move that shares a type with its user\nmultiplies the move’s base power of 100 by 1.5,\r\nmaking the power 150![VAR 0114(0025)]
The fact that the opponent is weak to the move’s\ntype then doubles that power from 150 to 300![VAR 0114(0025)]
The original power of the move ends up being\ntripled! Isn’t that amazing?[VAR 0114(0025)]
What’s more, if a Pokémon Terastallizes and its\nTera Type matches one of its original types, then\r\nthe bonus it gets for using a move of that same\r\ntype increases from 1.5 to 2![VAR 0114(0025)]
Of course, being able to use a lot of moves with\ndifferent types is great as well. That’s one way\r\nyou can surprise your opponent.[VAR 0114(0025)]
In the end, your own innate characteristics are\nwhat will really let you shine the most.[VAR 0114(0025)]
Bear in mind that this is true for both humans and\nPokémon.[VAR 0114(0025)]
It sure would make me happy if you could take\nthose words to heart![VAR 0114(0025)]
But I suppose I should really have shared this\nbasic advice right from our first lesson.\c\nMy apologies...[VAR 0114(0025)]
And just like that, class is over. The last of our\ntime together flew by in the blink of an eye.[VAR 0114(0025)]
It was so much fun to be able to teach all you\neager students about numbers.[VAR 0114(0025)]
Next class will be our fun final exam! Be sure to\nreview the material well in preparation.[VAR 0114(0025)]

This test was the culmination of all I taught you,\nand I’m sure you all did just fine.[VAR 0114(0025)]
Do go and ask for your scores at the front desk\nand then take a nice break.[VAR 0114(0025)]

Oho... I see we have some new students here with\nus today.[VAR 0114(002C)]
My name is Raifort. I will be the one to impart\nknowledge of the past to your little minds.[VAR 0114(0027)]
History is a wonderful thing. Truly splendid.\c\nThe lives of our ancestors throughout history\nforged the path to the present in which we live![VAR 0114(0027)]
Today, you shall learn about the most mysterious\nlocation in all of Paldea—the Great Crater.[VAR 0114(0027)]
As you are all aware, a massive crater known as\nthe Great Crater of Paldea exists in the heart of\r\nour region.[VAR 0114(0027)]
The area inside this crater is called Area Zero,\nand research of its geological strata and material\r\ncomposition has shown that the crater is in fact\r\nover one million years old.[VAR 0114(0027)]
It was long believed that [VAR FF00(0006)]a certain something[VAR FF00(0000)]\nrested at the bottom of this mysterious crater.[VAR 0114(0027)]
Aha. Perfect timing to make eye contact, young\n[VAR 0100(0000)]. Answer me this...[VAR 0114(0027)]
What exactly was believed to rest in the depths\nof the Great Crater—inside Area Zero?[VAR 0114(0027)]
Treasure
A Snorlax
A Pokémon Center
Heh. That is correct! You are a surprisingly clever\none, aren’t you? I see you did your homework\r\nprior to coming to my class.[VAR 0114(0027)]
Incorrect! An adorable answer, to be sure, but\nwere you perhaps fooled by my use of “rest”?\r\nThe correct answer is treasure.[VAR 0114(0027)]
Incorrect! An interesting answer, to be sure, but\nthat would be quite the anachronistic artifact.\r\nThe correct answer is treasure.[VAR 0114(0027)]
That’s right! Some believed that a treasure more\nvaluable than anything else in this world rested in\r\nthe depths of the Great Crater![VAR 0114(0027)]
So much for dreams of treasure hunting, though,\nas a lab has been built in those very same depths.[VAR 0114(0027)]
Oh, and before I forget—you would all do well\nto remember that the Great Crater and Area\r\nZero are both off-limits to all but those who\r\nhave official business there.[VAR 0114(0027)]
Do not dare entertain the foolish notion of\ngallivanting off to Area Zero in search of riches.\c\nIt is no place for children dreaming of treasure\nand adventure![VAR 0114(0027)]
Besides, if it were at all possible to investigate\nthe area, I would surely be the first to do so![VAR 0114(0027)]
Oho, is that the time already? I must’ve gotten\nswept up in filling your minds with knowledge.[VAR 0114(0027)]
This ends today’s lesson. We will unravel more of\nhistory’s enigmas together next time.[VAR 0114(0027)]

Greetings, my little students. Whatever you did\nyesterday, it is now a part of history.[VAR 0114(0027)]
Today, we will continue to unravel the marvels\nthat history has presented to us.[VAR 0114(0027)]
About two thousand years ago, this region came\nunder the rule of the Paldean Empire.[VAR 0114(0027)]
Historical accounts describe the Paldean emperor\nas being quite the dictator.[VAR 0114(0027)]
This emperor also zealously believed the legend\nof the treasure that rests deep within Area Zero.[VAR 0114(0027)]
I must mention that the civilizations of our\nancestors were not as developed as ours is today.[VAR 0114(0027)]
People back then were far more likely to believe\nin mysterious legends, magic, and beings beyond\r\nhuman comprehension.[VAR 0114(0027)]
In an attempt to gain the power to stand against\nPaldea’s neighboring countries, the emperor\r\nsent people in droves to join the hunt for the\r\nfabled treasure of Area Zero.[VAR 0114(0027)]
Aha. Perfect timing to make eye contact, young\n[VAR 0100(0000)]. Answer me this...[VAR 0114(0027)]
Approximately how many years ago was it that\nthe Paldean Empire began to rule this region?[VAR 0114(0027)]
About one thousand years ago
About two thousand years ago
About three thousand years ago
Incorrect! You’re off by an entire millennium!\c\nWhy, one thousand years ago, the Paldean\nEmpire had already begun to collapse![VAR 0114(0027)]
Heh. That is correct!\c\nYou are a surprisingly clever one, aren’t you?\nI see you’re listening intently to my lecture.[VAR 0114(0027)]
Incorrect! You’re off by an entire millennium!\c\nWhy, three thousand years ago, the Paldean\nEmpire didn’t even exist yet![VAR 0114(0027)]
The answer is about two thousand years ago.\nThat is when the Great Era of Exploration began.[VAR 0114(0027)]
However, it is said that not a single adventurer\nsent out by the emperor ever reached the depths\r\nof Area Zero.[VAR 0114(0027)]
Was it the punishing journey itself that barred\ntheir way? Or perhaps some unknown creature?[VAR 0114(0027)]
The resounding failure of this “Great” Era of\nExploration almost certainly heightened the air\r\nof mystery surrounding the crater.[VAR 0114(0027)]
Oh, what I wouldn’t give to explore Area Zero in\nits untouched state at that time![VAR 0114(0027)]
I suppose I can only hope for the swift invention\nof a time machine.[VAR 0114(0027)]
Oho, is that the time already? I must’ve gotten\nswept up in filling your minds with knowledge.[VAR 0114(0027)]
This ends today’s lesson. We will unravel more of\nhistory’s enigmas together next time.[VAR 0114(0027)]

Greetings, my little students. Whatever you did\nyesterday, it is now a part of history.[VAR 0114(0027)]
Today, we will continue to unravel the marvels\nthat history has presented to us.[VAR 0114(0027)]
As you should remember from our last class,\nArea Zero’s Great Era of Exploration began\r\nabout two thousand years ago.[VAR 0114(0027)]
This era lasted for approximately one thousand\nyears, but not a single soul was able to venture\r\nall the way to the deepest reaches of Area Zero.[VAR 0114(0027)]
Having poured much of its human and financial\nresources into the exploration of Area Zero for\r\nso long, the Paldean Empire fell into decline.[VAR 0114(0027)]
Two hundred years later—or eight hundred years\nago—the empire and its surrounding nations\r\nunited into one entity.\c\nThis was the formation of Paldea as we know it\ntoday.[VAR 0114(0027)]
Ah yes, this very academy where you’re now\nfilling your young minds with knowledge was also\r\napparently established at that time.[VAR 0114(0027)]
In fact, this school building—though certainly\nhaving undergone repairs through the years—\r\nis just as it was when it was built so long ago.[VAR 0114(0027)]
This very structure is a piece of history! Ahh!\nThings of old are truly splendid![VAR 0114(0027)]
I would certainly prefer it not to have the Poké\nBall portion, though—a relatively new addition.[VAR 0114(0027)]
Aha. Perfect timing to make eye contact, young\n[VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0027)]
Let’s see if you’ve been listening to my lecture.\c\nTell me—approximately how many years ago\nwas this academy of ours established?[VAR 0114(0027)]
About six hundred years ago
About seven hundred years ago
About eight hundred years ago
Incorrect! You are missing two hundred years of\nsplendid history![VAR 0114(0027)]
Incorrect! You are missing one hundred years of\nsplendid history![VAR 0114(0027)]
Correct! I see the look of concentration on your\nface was indeed just that.\c\nI hate nothing more than when a student only\npretends to listen.[VAR 0114(0027)]
This academy was constructed exactly 805 years\nago, to be precise. In other words, your academy\r\nhere is 805 years old![VAR 0114(0027)]
At the time, it offered state-of-the-art facilities\nand a uniquely innovative curriculum. As such,\r\npeople used to say...[VAR 0114(0027)]
“Those seeking knowledge need look no further\nthan the oranges of Paldea.”\c\nThat’s right—they were referring to Naranja\nAcademy![VAR 0114(0027)]
“Those seeking knowledge need look no further\nthan the grapes of Paldea.”\c\nThat’s right—they were referring to Uva\nAcademy![VAR 0114(0027)]
It is said that this proverb of sorts was even used\noutside of the Paldea region.[VAR 0114(0027)]
Oho, is that the time already? I must’ve gotten\nswept up in filling your minds with knowledge.[VAR 0114(0027)]
This ends today’s lesson. Our next class will be\nour midterm exam.\c\nBring the wonders of history to the forefront of\nyour minds in preparation.[VAR 0114(0027)]

That last question was a freebie. Even the least\ncapable of you surely padded your score there.\r\nI sincerely hope you did, anyway.[VAR 0114(0027)]
So ends our midterm examination. You may ask\nfor your scores at the school’s front desk.[VAR 0114(0027)]

Greetings, my little students. Whatever you did\nyesterday, it is now a part of history.[VAR 0114(0027)]
I was hoping to continue unraveling the marvels\nthat history has presented to us today.\c\nHowever, I imagine your ability to concentrate\nhas been spectacularly derailed by my midterm.[VAR 0114(0027)]
I suppose changing things up for fun and variety\nmay be a good idea every now and then.[VAR 0114(0027)]
So allow me to tell you an old fairy tale that has\nbeen passed down in Paldea for generations.[VAR 0114(0027)]
Once upon a time, there was a king who very\nmuch enjoyed collecting treasure.[VAR 0114(0027)]
He was particularly fond of treasures from\nother countries.\c\nOne day, a merchant from the East heard rumors\nof this king and came to meet him.[VAR 0114(0027)]
The merchant laid out four treasures in front of\nthe treasure-loving king.[VAR 0114(0027)]
The four treasures were as follows: a vessel, a\nsword, a set of tablets, and a set of beads.[VAR 0114(0027)]
Seeing such rarities before him, the king leaped\nfor joy.[VAR 0114(0027)]
He showered the merchant with gold coins and\nclaimed all four of the treasures for himself.[VAR 0114(0027)]
Aha. Perfect timing to make eye contact, young\n[VAR 0100(0000)]. Answer me this...[VAR 0114(0027)]
I said that one of the treasures was a “set of\ntablets.” What do you think these tablets were?[VAR 0114(0027)]
Wooden planks for writing on
Handheld electronic devices
Medicine that you chew
Correct! Your daily pursuit of knowledge serves\nyou well.[VAR 0114(0027)]
Incorrect! Is that some kind of joke? Were you\nexpecting me to laugh at your assumption that\r\nelectronic tablets existed in the distant past?[VAR 0114(0027)]
Incorrect! Is that some kind of joke? Were you\nexpecting me to laugh at the notion that\r\nchewable tablets would be considered treasure?[VAR 0114(0027)]
These particular tablets were wooden and used\nas a writing medium in the East in ancient times.[VAR 0114(0027)]
As you may know, they fell out of popular use\nas paper become more universally available.[VAR 0114(0027)]
For the king to consider these paper substitutes\ntreasures, they must have been of superb quality.\c\nThat, or perhaps they had some amazingly\nprofound teachings written on them.[VAR 0114(0027)]
So, the king obtained these four treasures, and\non that very night...[VAR 0114(0027)]
it is said that a terrible disaster rained down upon\nhis castle, reducing it to rubble by dawn.[VAR 0114(0027)]
Oho, is that the time already? I wasn’t done with\nmy story, but alas. So ends today’s lesson.[VAR 0114(0027)]
If you are interested in how the story ends,\nyou may come see me outside class hours.[VAR 0114(0027)]

Greetings, my little students. Whatever you did\nyesterday, it is now a part of history.[VAR 0114(0027)]
Today, we will continue to unravel the marvels\nthat history has presented to us.[VAR 0114(0027)]
I trust that you all remember our lesson before\nthe midterm exam concerning the Great Crater\r\nof Paldea and its interior—Area Zero.[VAR 0114(0027)]
This mysterious crater captured the imaginations\nof many—including the former Paldean emperor.[VAR 0114(0027)]
Two hundred years ago, a group of explorers\nclaimed to have finally reached its depths.[VAR 0114(0027)]
The name of the team that achieved this great\nfeat was the Area Zero Expedition.[VAR 0114(0027)]
The team is said to have been made up of\nPaldea’s best and brightest.[VAR 0114(0027)]
Skilled battlers, brilliant researchers—talented\nindividuals of all kinds.[VAR 0114(0027)]
Among the list of team members was the name\nof a man who was an author and brilliant natural\r\nhistorian: [VAR FF00(0006)]Heath[VAR FF00(0000)].[VAR 0114(0027)]
After returning from the expedition to Area Zero,\nhe used his literary talent to record the events of\r\nthe expedition and publish them.[VAR 0114(0027)]
Aha. Perfect timing to make eye contact, young\n[VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0027)]
Let’s see if you were paying attention.\c\nWhat was the name of the team that first made it\nto the deepest reaches of the Great Crater?[VAR 0114(0027)]
The Area Zero Adventurers
The Area Zero Expedition
The Area Zero Survey Corps
Incorrect! I see that even your little head has\nbecome full of dreams of adventure.[VAR 0114(0027)]
Correct! To pick up on and remember a term I\nsimply slipped into the flow of the lecture...\r\nYou really are quite the clever one.[VAR 0114(0027)]
Incorrect! Though I will admit that an expedition\nand a survey corps may take part in very\r\nsimilar activities![VAR 0114(0027)]
The correct name for this team was the Area\nZero Expedition![VAR 0114(0027)]
The record of their activities written by the\nexpedition member Heath can be found in\r\nbookstores and the like even today.[VAR 0114(0027)]
This record is now known as the[VAR FF00(0006)] Scarlet Book[VAR FF00(0000)].[VAR 0114(0027)]
This record is now known as the[VAR FF00(0006)] Violet Book[VAR FF00(0000)].[VAR 0114(0027)]
At the time, the entire region of Paldea was\nabsolutely buzzing about Area Zero.[VAR 0114(0027)]
The Scarlet Book was so popular that practically\neveryone had a copy.[VAR 0114(0027)]
The Violet Book was so popular that practically\neveryone had a copy.[VAR 0114(0027)]
However, the book itself was full of fantastical\ndescriptions and illustrations of things that could\r\nnever be thought of as real.\c\nThe masses began to call Heath a liar.[VAR 0114(0027)]
Even the truth of the expedition making it to the\nbottom of the crater was called into question.[VAR 0114(0027)]
The Scarlet Book was condemned to the shelves\nof used bookstores as just another book of wild\r\nparanormal stories.[VAR 0114(0027)]
The Violet Book was condemned to the shelves\nof used bookstores as just another book of wild\r\nparanormal stories.[VAR 0114(0027)]
There’s a copy on one of the bookshelves on the\nground floor of the entrance hall.\c\nFeel free to have a read if you’re interested.[VAR 0114(0027)]
Oho, is that the time already? I must’ve gotten\nswept up in filling your minds with knowledge.[VAR 0114(0027)]
This ends today’s lesson. We will unravel more of\nhistory’s enigmas together next time.[VAR 0114(0027)]

Greetings, my little students. Whatever you did\nyesterday, it is now a part of history.[VAR 0114(0027)]
Today is our last class, so I would like to unravel\nthe marvels that history has presented to us\r\none last time.[VAR 0114(0027)]
In our last class, I taught you about the Area Zero\nExpedition of two hundred years ago, correct?[VAR 0114(0027)]
Alas, two hundred years is not that long ago.\nNot that long ago at all.[VAR 0114(0027)]
How unfortunate that our history lessons must\nmarch so inexorably toward the future.[VAR 0114(0027)]
Would it not be more of an adventure to march\ntoward the past instead?\c\nTo start from our present and study history\nin reverse?![VAR 0114(0027)]
I think it would!
That might be hard to follow...
[VAR BD06(0000)]So you agree with me, do you,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]?\c\nHowever, I’m afraid I risk incurring the wrath of\nour dear director if I stray from the curriculum.[VAR 0114(0027)]
Indeed. It may be difficult to understand the\nflow of events—how one thing leads to another—\r\nif we were to trace history in reverse.[VAR 0114(0027)]
*sigh* I suppose I have no choice but to let the\nflow of time carry us toward the future.[VAR 0114(0027)]
In this last class of ours, I shall fill your minds with\nthe history of the Terastal phenomenon.[VAR 0114(0027)]
The technology behind Tera Orbs has its origins\nin Area Zero.[VAR 0114(0027)]
Even after the Area Zero Expedition supposedly\nreached the crater’s deepest depths, others\r\ncontinued to explore that area...[VAR 0114(0027)]
And, around 140 years ago, Pokémon cloaked\nin a mysterious light were discovered there.[VAR 0114(0027)]
As you may have already guessed, these were, in\nfact, Terastallized Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0027)]
However, when those who discovered these\nPokémon brought them out of Area Zero, the\r\nlight faded, and the Terastal phenomenon\r\nremained a mystery for quite some time.[VAR 0114(0027)]
However, 10 years ago—ugh, that might as well\nbe present day—a certain someone you have\r\ndefinitely heard of unraveled this mystery.[VAR 0114(0027)]
Aha. Perfect timing to make eye contact, young\n[VAR 0100(0000)]. Answer me this...[VAR 0114(0027)]
What is the name of the famous professor who\nunraveled the Terastal phenomenon mystery?[VAR 0114(0027)]
Professor Heath
Professor Sada
Professor Turo
Professor Clavell
Incorrect! Heath is the one who wrote the record\nof the Area Zero Expedition’s activities. You must\r\nbe remembering our last class together.[VAR 0114(0027)]
Correct! To think that you—a new transfer to our\nacademy—could correctly answer this question...\r\nYou must be very diligent in your studies.[VAR 0114(0027)]
Incorrect! Or, no...perhaps you are correct, in a\nroundabout sort of way...[VAR 0114(0027)]
Approximately 10 years ago, a professor\nnamed Sada unraveled the mystery of the\r\nTerastal phenomenon.[VAR 0114(0027)]
Approximately 10 years ago, a professor\nnamed Turo unraveled the mystery of the\r\nTerastal phenomenon.[VAR 0114(0027)]
She discovered that the shining crystals down in\nArea Zero—or rather, the energy they emit—is\r\nwhat causes Pokémon to Terastallize.[VAR 0114(0027)]
He discovered that the shining crystals down in\nArea Zero—or rather, the energy they emit—is\r\nwhat causes Pokémon to Terastallize.[VAR 0114(0027)]
This led the professor to invent Tera Orb\ntechnology and to develop a practical use for it.\c\nThis technology was then shared with both the\nPokémon League and our academy.[VAR 0114(0027)]
Rumor has it that Director Clavell was one of the\nresearchers on the professor’s team...[VAR 0114(0027)]
Alas. This story is much less exciting now that\nsomeone we all know appears in it.\c\nModern history truly is dull, isn’t it?[VAR 0114(0027)]
Thus ends my history classes. Our next session\nwill be our final exam.\c\nBring the wonders of history to the forefront of\nyour minds in preparation.[VAR 0114(0027)]

I’m so heureux—or happy—for this chance to\nre-experience my younger days with you all![VAR 0114(0026)]
Do you know what “Salvatore” means? It means\n“savior”! So just imagine I’m here to SAVE you\r\nfrom spooooky new languages. Haha! Funny, no?[VAR 0114(0026)]
That’s right! My classes will teach you about\nvarious languages from different regions.[VAR 0114(0026)]
You may say “Good morning!” or “Hello!” as a\ngreeting, but people from elsewhere may say\r\n“Bonjour!” or “Salut!”[VAR 0114(0026)]
I’ve heard there’s even a popular streamer out\nthere who smashes several languages together\r\nand says “’Ello, ’ello, hola! Ciao and bonjour!”[VAR 0114(0026)]
There are so many regions out there in our world,\nand each can have their own unique languages![VAR 0114(0026)]
Gracias, merci, xièxie, arigato, danke—these all\nhave the same meaning! Can you guess what it is?[VAR 0114(0026)]

And now, apropos of nothing, let me give you\nall one of my wise words of advice![VAR 0114(0026)]
When you travel abroad, you should try to speak\nthe local language as much as you can—even if\r\nyou can’t speak it very well![VAR 0114(0026)]
I’m sure your willingness to try will make the\npeople you meet très heureux—very happy![VAR 0114(0026)]
Honestly, from my experience, just being able to\nsay “hello,” “delicious,” and “thank you” in the\r\nlocal language will get you pretty far.[VAR 0114(0026)]
For everything else, just pretend you’re Mr. Mime\nand gesture away![VAR 0114(0026)]
Oh! There’s that pesky bell. I guess that’s all the\ntime we have for today![VAR 0114(0026)]
Well, adios! Mata ne! À la prochaine! See you\nlater, everyone![VAR 0114(0026)]

My dear friends! How ARE you all today?\nFeeling absolutely fantastic, I hope?[VAR 0114(0026)]
It’s time for Salvatore’s Language Lesson!\nÊtes-vous prêts—are you ready, everyone?\r\nYou can answer with “Yes” or “Oui”![VAR 0114(0026)]
Yes!
Oui!
C’est super![VAR 0114(0026)]
In our last class, I believe I taught you all how to\nsay “thank you” in other languages, right?[VAR 0114(0026)]
In le cours d’aujourd’hui—today’s class—we will\nlearn about a certain word sure to make people\r\nhappy when you use it in your travels abroad![VAR 0114(0026)]
What word, you ask? Well, you’ll have to guess!\nDélicieux! Hǎochī! Buono! Can anyone tell me\r\nwhat these words mean?[VAR 0114(0026)]
Delicious
Sorry
Help
Waouh! Correct! C’est super! I knew I could\ncount on you, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0026)]
Oh, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nIf sorry really did “cut it,” as they say, the justice\nsystem would be inutile—unnecessary! Sorry,\r\nbut that’s a mauvaise réponse—a wrong answer![VAR 0114(0026)]
Oh, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nI hear your SOS! Don’t worry! I’ll SAVE you,\nor my name’s not Salvatore! That was a mauvaise\r\nréponse—a wrong answer—but I hear you![VAR 0114(0026)]
Délicieux! Hǎochī! Buono! All of these words\nmean “delicious”![VAR 0114(0026)]
Using the local word for “delicious” at markets or\nrestaurants is sure to get a big sourire—a smile,\r\nthat is—from whoever you’re talking to![VAR 0114(0026)]
It’ll make communication go more smoothly—\nI guarantee it![VAR 0114(0026)]
People love it when someone says the cuisine of\ntheir homeland is delicious! Who wouldn’t be\r\nheureux—happy—to receive such a compliment?[VAR 0114(0026)]
And now, apropos of nothing, let me give you\nall one of my wise words of advice![VAR 0114(0026)]
The first step to smooth communication is to\ncompliment the person you’re talking to![VAR 0114(0026)]
After all, it’s not very likely that a compliment\nwould put someone in a bad mood![VAR 0114(0026)]
This doesn’t only apply to people in other\nregions, either! It’s the same for all of you, too!\r\nYou can put this tip to use with your classmates![VAR 0114(0026)]
How about you all try complimenting each other\nafter class? I bet it will make for an ambiance\r\nplus sympathique—a more friendly atmosphere![VAR 0114(0026)]
That’s all for today! See you all au prochain\ncours—next lesson, that is! Adios! Mata ne![VAR 0114(0026)]

My dear friends! How ARE you all today?\nYou certainly look fantastic![VAR 0114(0026)]
It’s time for another one of Salvatore’s Language\nLessons! Êtes-vous prêts—are you ready?![VAR 0114(0026)]
... ... ...\n... ... ...\r\nAhem. Êtes-vous prêts—are you ready?![VAR 0114(0026)]
Y-yes!
O-oui!
Très bien! Very good![VAR 0114(0026)]
My lessons are not a one-way street! Non non!\nI am très triste when no one speaks up!\r\nVery sad, that is![VAR 0114(0026)]
In our last class, I believe I taught you all how to\nsay “delicious” in other languages, right?[VAR 0114(0026)]
In le cours d’aujourd’hui—today’s class—we will\nlearn about a very special phrase that you can\r\nput to use when the time is juuust right![VAR 0114(0026)]
Ai shiteiru! Je t’aime! Te amo! Ich liebe dich!\nDoes anyone know what these phrases mean?[VAR 0114(0026)]
Time to eat
I love you
I’m going home
Oh, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nNon non! We can’t have you eating anyone!\nThat’s a mauvaise réponse—a wrong answer![VAR 0114(0026)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Fantastique, [VAR 0100(0000)]! Correct!\nYou\r\ndeserve\r\na\r\nmédaille\r\nd’or—a\r\ngold medal![VAR 0114(0026)]
Oh, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nNon non! I can’t let you go home just yet!\nThat’s a mauvaise réponse—a wrong answer![VAR 0114(0026)]
Je t’aime! Te amo! Ich liebe dich! These three\nphrases you may know, I think! Why? Because\r\nthey’re all quite famous ways to say “I love you!”[VAR 0114(0026)]
Oh, my! Have I embarrassed you all, my friends?\nWhat timides little garçons et filles—shy boys\r\nand girls, that is![VAR 0114(0026)]
It’s so very important to express your feelings\nabout things to others, you know! This is\r\nESPECIALLY true for positive emotions![VAR 0114(0026)]
If you get married someday and argue with your\nspouse over some silly little thing...[VAR 0114(0026)]
All you have to do is apologize and say “I love\nyou” et tout ira bien—and all will be well, that is![VAR 0114(0026)]
I should know! Why, just last week, I had a big\nargument with ma femme—my dear wife, that is!\r\nBut I was quick to say I’m sorry, and all was well![VAR 0114(0026)]
And now, apropos of nothing, let me give you\nall one of my wise words of advice![VAR 0114(0026)]
It’s best to be quick to apologize when you have\nan argument with someone![VAR 0114(0026)]
That goes for your families, friends, AND your\ncrushes! I know you can do it! I believe in you![VAR 0114(0026)]
Our prochain cours—our next class—will be the\nmidterm exam! Be sure to review what we learned\r\nin all our lessons so far! Adios! Mata ne![VAR 0114(0026)]

I’m sure you all did great! Bravo, my friends! You\ncan check your scores at the school’s front desk.[VAR 0114(0026)]

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
How did you like the midterm exam? You all did\nreally great![VAR 0114(0026)]
We’re halfway there! And now, time for another\nlesson! Êtes-vous prêts—are you ready?[VAR 0114(0026)]
Yes!
Oui!
Très bonne réponse—great answer! Merci, my\nfriends! I knew I could count on you stars.[VAR 0114(0026)]
Leading up to the midterm, we learned all sorts\nof words from different regions![VAR 0114(0026)]
Starting today, though, I’ll be throwing a curve\nball—for we begin listening comprehension![VAR 0114(0026)]
Vas-y—go for it, my assistant! Pika pi, Pikachu![VAR 0114(0026)]
Pikachu!
As you just heard, Pokémon can also use words\nto communicate![VAR 0114(0026)]
It’s not always easy for us to understand them,\nbut their words have meaning—just as ours do.[VAR 0114(0026)]
Pokémon can use language to share all kinds of\ninformation with each other—like the location of\r\nfood or whether there may be predators nearby![VAR 0114(0026)]
The same Pokémon’s cries may sound different\ndepending on what it wants to say![VAR 0114(0026)]
I’m sure you’re all curious, so aujourd’hui—today,\nthat is—let’s learn some Pokémon language![VAR 0114(0026)]
Je t’en prie—if you would be so kind, Pikachu![VAR 0114(0026)]
Piggah!
What emotion do you suppose Pikachu was\ntrying to convey just now?[VAR 0114(0026)]
Happiness
Sadness
Anger
Say it again, Pikachu!
[VAR BD06(0000)]Sorry, [VAR 0100(0000)], that’s not right!\nPokémon\r\nlanguage\r\nis\r\nhard,\r\nisn’t it?[VAR 0114(0026)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Sorry, [VAR 0100(0000)], that’s not right!\nPokémon\r\nlanguage\r\nis\r\nhard,\r\nisn’t it?[VAR 0114(0026)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Merveilleux, [VAR 0100(0000)]! Correct!\nI guess\r\nwe\r\nshould\r\ncall\r\nyou “Professor”![VAR 0114(0026)]
When Pikachu says...[VAR 0114(0026)]
Piggah!
It’s using its angry voice![VAR 0114(0026)]
That’s right—I had my little Pikachu friend here\npretend to be angry for us![VAR 0114(0026)]
Don’t you think he did a great job? Give Pikachu\na round of applause, everyone![VAR 0114(0026)]
*clapping*
The same Pokémon can even communicate its\nfeelings in many different ways![VAR 0114(0026)]
Their voices change depending on their mood\nand physical condition.[VAR 0114(0026)]
Try listening more carefully to Pokémon—you\nmight gain a deeper understanding of them![VAR 0114(0026)]
That having been said, Pokémon are quite\nmysterious creatures![VAR 0114(0026)]
Some actually don’t communicate with words at\nall, but instead use things like electromagnetic\r\nor ultrasonic waves—some even use telepathy![VAR 0114(0026)]
And now, apropos of nothing, let me give you\nall one of my wise words of advice![VAR 0114(0026)]
If you poke at your Pokémon too many times\nwhile washing them during picnics, they’ll get\r\nmad at you like Pikachu just demonstrated![VAR 0114(0026)]
Well, adios! Mata ne! À la prochaine! See you\nlater, everyone![VAR 0114(0026)]

Yes!
Oui!
I would expect no less from my excellent friends!\nEven your replies to my questions are excellent![VAR 0114(0026)]
Aujourd’hui—today—we will once again be\nfocusing on listening![VAR 0114(0026)]
Vas-y—go for it, my assistant! Pika pi, Pikachu![VAR 0114(0026)]
Pikachu!
As you may remember from our last class,\nthe same Pokémon’s cries may sound different\r\ndepending on what it wants to say![VAR 0114(0026)]
Aujourd’hui—today, that is—we will be learning\nmore about the language used by Pokémon![VAR 0114(0026)]
Je t’en prie—if you would be so kind, Pikachu![VAR 0114(0026)]
Pikaaa...
Hmmm! That sounds a little bleak, doesn’t it? Its\nvoice seems a little lower pitched, too![VAR 0114(0026)]
What emotion do you suppose Pikachu was\ntrying to convey just now?[VAR 0114(0026)]
Happiness
Sadness
Surprise
Say it again, Pikachu!
[VAR BD06(0000)]Oh no, [VAR 0100(0000)]! That’s\nincorrect.\c\nAu contraire—on the contrary, I believe it’s\nthe opposite![VAR 0114(0026)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Ding ding ding! That’s right,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]! Fantastique![VAR 0114(0026)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Oh no, [VAR 0100(0000)]! That’s\nincorrect.\r\nUnless,\r\nperhaps,\r\nPikachu\r\nwas\r\nso\r\nsurprised\r\nthat\r\nit\r\ndropped\r\na\r\ntasty Berry![VAR 0114(0026)]
When Pikachu says...[VAR 0114(0026)]
Pikaaa...
It’s expressing sadness! Kind of makes you want\nto cry, doesn’t it?[VAR 0114(0026)]
That’s right—I had my little Pikachu cry as if it\nwas...crying! Haha! Funny joke, right?[VAR 0114(0026)]
Don’t you think it did a great job? Give Pikachu\na round of applause, everyone![VAR 0114(0026)]
*clapping*
And now, apropos of nothing, let me give you\nall one of my wise words of advice![VAR 0114(0026)]
If you hear one of your Pokémon making sad\nnoises like this one, you should treat them with\r\neven more kindness than usual.[VAR 0114(0026)]
Well, you probably already knew that, though! A\npiece of cake for you all, I’m sure![VAR 0114(0026)]
Of course, this goes for your classmates and\nothers as well![VAR 0114(0026)]
Friends should support each other in times of\nsadness! I truly hope that you all can have smiles\r\non your faces all the time, my friends![VAR 0114(0026)]
Our prochain cours—next lesson, that is—will be\nour final lesson together! I hope you’re ready for\r\nthe climactic finale! Adios! Mata ne![VAR 0114(0026)]

Let’s get right to it, my little Pikachu friend![VAR 0114(0026)]
For our last listening class...tell everyone how\nyou’re feeling right now, s’il te plaît![VAR 0114(0026)]
Chaaa!
Oooh! Can you feel that? That’s one contagious\nemotion in Pikachu’s voice![VAR 0114(0026)]
What emotion do you suppose Pikachu was\ntrying to convey just now?[VAR 0114(0026)]
Happiness
Pain

Say it again, Pikachu!
[VAR BD06(0000)]Well done, [VAR 0100(0000)]! I’m so\nHAPPY\r\nthat\r\nyou\r\ngot\r\nit\r\nright!\r\nHaha!\r\nGet it?[VAR 0114(0026)]
Oh, my! Did Pikachu sound like it was in pain to\nyou, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0026)]
Oh, my! Did Pikachu sound surprised to\nyou, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0026)]
When Pikachu says...[VAR 0114(0026)]
Chaaa!
It’s expressing happiness! Doesn’t it make you\njust want to break out into a happy dance?[VAR 0114(0026)]
But I didn’t have to ask Pikachu to put on an act\ntoday. Oh no—I simply asked it to show you all\r\nhow it felt about getting to have class with you![VAR 0114(0026)]
Getting to meet so many new friends and study\ntogether in this class with you...[VAR 0114(0026)]
It’s made both me and my little Pikachu so\nvery happy![VAR 0114(0026)]
And now, apropos of nothing, let me give you\nall one last wise word of advice![VAR 0114(0026)]
As you live your lives, I’m sure you will all have\ntimes when you get mad or sad—maybe even\r\nmore than you would like![VAR 0114(0026)]
Everything has its ups and downs. Life is a\nveritable roller coaster![VAR 0114(0026)]
But, à la fin—in the end, that is—there is surely\nhappiness waiting for you!\c\nSo gardez le sourire—keep a smile on your face—\neven in the hardest of times![VAR 0114(0026)]

Osu! Say hello to your battle instructor—\nThe one! The only! The hot-blooded Dendra!\c\n“Osu” is a karate thing, by the way. Look it up![VAR 0114(0024)]
My age? 25! My hobby? Working out!\nMy...type?! Well...[VAR 0114(0024)]
Strong and muscular Fighting types, of course![VAR 0114(0024)]
That’s all for my introduction! As for my class,\nthis is where you all get to learn the nitty-gritty\r\nof Pokémon battling![VAR 0114(0024)]
We’ll start with the basics so that no Trainer gets\nleft in the dust! Even if you’re new to this stuff,\r\nhave no fear![VAR 0114(0024)]
Leave it to me and my muscles, and you’ll be\npros in no time.\c\nLet’s set our fighting spirits ablaze—together![VAR 0114(0024)]
Pokémon have all kinds of attack moves at their\ndisposal, and each move has certain qualities\r\nthat you’ll want to remember![VAR 0114(0024)]
I’m talking about the power, type, and [VAR FF00(0006)]category[VAR FF00(0000)]\nof these moves![VAR 0114(0024)]
Higher power means more damage—especially if\nyour opponent is weak to that move’s type![VAR 0114(0024)]
Heads up, new kid! Question coming your way!\c\nThere are two categories that attack moves can\nfall under. Know what they are?[VAR 0114(0024)]
Moves of light and moves of darkness
Physical moves and special moves
Moves you love and moves you hate
That’s not only wrong—it’s totally out there!\c\nAre you OK, new kid?! Or are you just at that\nage where you’re really into fantasy stuff?[VAR 0114(0024)]
Awesome! You’re just as sharp as I expected, new\nkid! Looks like you have a handle on the basics![VAR 0114(0024)]
That’s not only wrong—it’s kinda sad!\c\nAre you OK, new kid?! Or are you just at that\nage where you’re really into bittersweet stuff?[VAR 0114(0024)]
Anyway, attack moves are split into two\ncategories—[VAR FF00(0006)]physical[VAR FF00(0000)] and [VAR FF00(0006)]special[VAR FF00(0000)]![VAR 0114(0024)]
Physical moves do more damage the higher the\nPokémon’s [VAR FF00(0006)]Attack[VAR FF00(0000)] stat is![VAR 0114(0024)]
And special moves do more damage the higher\nthe Pokémon’s [VAR FF00(0006)]Sp. Atk[VAR FF00(0000)] stat is![VAR 0114(0024)]
On the other side of things, Pokémon getting hit\nby these moves can take less damage by having\r\na high [VAR FF00(0006)]Defense[VAR FF00(0000)] or [VAR FF00(0006)]Sp. Def [VAR FF00(0000)]stat, respectively![VAR 0114(0024)]
In conclusion![VAR 0114(0024)]
Pokémon that are good with [VAR FF00(0006)]physical moves[VAR FF00(0000)]\nshould raise their [VAR FF00(0006)]Attack[VAR FF00(0000)] stat!\c\nAnd Pokémon that are good with [VAR FF00(0006)]special moves[VAR FF00(0000)]\nshould raise their [VAR FF00(0006)]Sp. Atk[VAR FF00(0000)] stat![VAR 0114(0024)]
Trying to raise both of these stats equally will just\nmake it hard for the Pokémon to shine in battle![VAR 0114(0024)]
Make your strong points stronger, I always say—\nthat goes for both people and Pokémon![VAR 0114(0024)]
Aw, man! I was just about to suggest we do some\nhands-on practice to really drive the point home,\r\nbut I guess we’re out of time...[VAR 0114(0024)]
We’ll generally meet for my class here in the\nschoolyard—even for book learning!\c\nNothing like a little fresh air to make studying\nmore fun, am I right?[VAR 0114(0024)]
But class is over for now! Take care, you little\nrascals![VAR 0114(0024)]

Another day, another round of battle study! Osu!\nLet’s get right to it![VAR 0114(0024)]
Is everyone excited about the Treasure Hunt?![VAR 0114(0024)]
It’s always a great adventure! You get to take on\nGyms, go to new places, and run all over the\r\nplace with your partner Pokémon![VAR 0114(0024)]
And, while you’re running around out there,\nI’ll bet you’ll come across some big, shining\r\n[VAR FF00(0006)]crystals [VAR FF00(0000)]fairly often as well.[VAR 0114(0024)]
These crystals are actually collections of Terastal\nenergy that’s seeped up out of the ground![VAR 0114(0024)]
You can check out these crystals to battle Tera\nPokémon with your friends or other Trainers in a\r\ngroup of four.[VAR 0114(0024)]
We call those battles...Tera Raid Battles![VAR 0114(0024)]
The Tera Pokémon you’ll face off against in Tera\nRaid Battles are crazy tough![VAR 0114(0024)]
They sometimes act differently than regular\nPokémon, so you’ll need to be on your guard![VAR 0114(0024)]
Luckily, Trainers can also use a special action in\nTera Raid Battles. It’s called [VAR FF00(0006)]cheering[VAR FF00(0000)]![VAR 0114(0024)]
And there are three different cheers you can use![VAR 0114(0024)]
The first cheer is “[VAR FF00(0006)]Go all out![VAR FF00(0000)]” It boosts the\nAttack and Sp. Atk of all ally Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0024)]
The second is “[VAR FF00(0006)]Hang tough![VAR FF00(0000)]” This one boosts\nthe Defense and Sp. Def of all ally Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0024)]
And the third— Well, let’s see if you can guess![VAR 0114(0024)]
This cheer restores HP for all ally Pokémon.\nWhat do you think it is?[VAR 0114(0024)]
Heal up!
Wham-Bam Potion!
Explosive healing wave!
That’s right! Maybe I should make YOU the battle\nteacher, huh, new kid?![VAR 0114(0024)]
Wham-Bam Potion?! That sounds less like a cheer\nand more like a seriously heavy-handed medical\r\ntreatment or something![VAR 0114(0024)]
Explosive healing wave?! That’s a wild answer if\nI ever heard one! But I think I’d like to give that\r\nmove a whirl if it really existed![VAR 0114(0024)]
The third and final cheer is “[VAR FF00(0006)]Heal up![VAR FF00(0000)]” It’s a real\npowerhouse, with the ability to both restore HP\r\nand cure status conditions![VAR 0114(0024)]
You can cheer up to three times during a single\nTera Raid Battle.[VAR 0114(0024)]
Also, cheering uses up a turn in battle, so you\nwon’t be able to have your Pokémon use any of\r\ntheir moves when you cheer![VAR 0114(0024)]
In conclusion![VAR 0114(0024)]
Try everything at your disposal! If nothing seems\nto be working, try cheering on your allies![VAR 0114(0024)]
Providing support for your team can sometimes\nopen up a new realm of possibilities![VAR 0114(0024)]
Aw, man! I was just about to suggest we do some\nhands-on practice to really drive the point home,\r\nbut I guess we’re out of time...[VAR 0114(0024)]
Class is over for now! Take care, you little rascals![VAR 0114(0024)]

Another day, another round of battle study! Osu!\nLet’s get right to it![VAR 0114(0024)]
Last time, we learned about Tera Raid Battles!\nDid any of you have a chance to try them out?[VAR 0114(0024)]
Tera Pokémon are super strong! And the more\ndifficult ones will use an even tougher tactic that\r\nyou’ll need to deal with.[VAR 0114(0024)]
I’m talking about their [VAR FF00(0006)]Tera Shield[VAR FF00(0000)]![VAR 0114(0024)]
What happens while a Pokémon has its\nTera Shield up, you ask?[VAR 0114(0024)]
Well, it’ll take WAAAY less damage, for one![VAR 0114(0024)]
It has a big effect on morale, too![VAR 0114(0024)]
When Trainers see that shield go up, they feel\ndoomed—like there’s no way to win the battle![VAR 0114(0024)]
So, here’s a question for you![VAR 0114(0024)]
If the Pokémon you’re battling puts up its Tera\nShield, what should you do?[VAR 0114(0024)]
Close your eyes and give in
Call your parents
Terastallize and attack it
What?! Don’t just accept defeat! You should be\nable to find a way out of this predicament if you\r\nkeep on fighting![VAR 0114(0024)]
What?! Don’t call your family to tell them you’re\nabout to lose! You should be able to find a way\r\nout of this predicament if you keep on fighting![VAR 0114(0024)]
That’s right! You’re a regular Tera Raid Battle\nmaster, aren’t you, new kid?[VAR 0114(0024)]
Regular attacks don’t work so well against\nPokémon that have their Tera Shield up.[VAR 0114(0024)]
But having your Pokémon Terastallize is an\neffective method to overcome that issue!\c\nA Terastallized Pokémon will do more damage\nto shielded Pokémon—especially if it uses moves\r\nthat match its Tera Type![VAR 0114(0024)]
Dealing enough damage to a Pokémon with its\nTera Shield up can destroy the shield and break\r\nthe Pokémon’s stance![VAR 0114(0024)]
This means that it’s important to properly time\nyour Terastallizing in Tera Raid Battles.[VAR 0114(0024)]
In conclusion![VAR 0114(0024)]
As they say, fight fire with fire and Tera\nPokémon with Tera Pokémon![VAR 0114(0024)]
Be sure to work together with your teammates to\nsmash through your opponent’s Tera Shield![VAR 0114(0024)]
Aw, man! I was just about to suggest we do some\nhands-on practice to really drive the point home,\r\nbut I guess we’re out of time once again...[VAR 0114(0024)]
Next class will be our midterm exam! Aim for a\nperfect score! Osu! Osu![VAR 0114(0024)]

Time’s up! Put your pencils down![VAR 0114(0024)]
I saw you giving it everything you’ve got! I’m sure\nyou’ll all get perfect scores![VAR 0114(0024)]
Well done, everyone. You can ask for your scores\nat the front desk![VAR 0114(0024)]

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Another day, another round of battle study! Osu!\nLet’s get right to it![VAR 0114(0024)]
You all gave everything you had on the midterm\nexams. Well done![VAR 0114(0024)]
We’ll resume our regular classes today, so keep\nup that energy for the second half of the term![VAR 0114(0024)]
Have you all been using the R Button to send out\nyour Pokémon?[VAR 0114(0024)]
If you do, your Pokémon will run off in the\ndirection you’re facing.[VAR 0114(0024)]
It’s a super-useful tactic that lets your Pokémon\npick up faraway items for you. And that’s not all![VAR 0114(0024)]
If there’s a wild Pokémon near where you sent\nyour Pokémon, they’ll start battling each other![VAR 0114(0024)]
We call those battles...Auto Battles![VAR 0114(0024)]
Just as the name implies, your Pokémon will\nact on its own during Auto Battles—meaning\r\nyou won’t have to give it any commands![VAR 0114(0024)]
And if your Pokémon wins, it’ll get Exp. Points\njust like it would in a regular battle.[VAR 0114(0024)]
If you make good use of these battles, they can\nbe a really efficient way to train your party![VAR 0114(0024)]
But you’ll want to remember that Pokémon won’t\nevolve or learn new moves right away if they level\r\nup from an Auto Battle.[VAR 0114(0024)]
Also, if a Pokémon LOSES an Auto Battle, it’ll\ncome back with just a small amount of HP left.\r\nMake sure to heal it up right away![VAR 0114(0024)]
Whoops. I just about did the whole class as a\none-sided lecture. Does anyone have any\r\nquestions so far?[VAR 0114(0024)]
How do I stop an Auto Battle?
Can I catch wild Pokémon in Auto Battles?
No questions here!
There’s no stopping an Auto Battle once it starts!\nYou’ll have to wait and see how it plays out!\c\nYou can call your Pokémon off before the battle\nstarts, though, if you press the ZR Button while\r\nyour Pokémon is still on its way to the opponent![VAR 0114(0024)]
If you let your Pokémon battle on its own, it’ll\nkeep going until its opponent is defeated!\c\nIf you want to catch a wild Pokémon, you’ll need\nto battle by issuing commands instead![VAR 0114(0024)]
Great! You’re all really good at this. I can’t wait\nto see where you go from here![VAR 0114(0024)]
Even during Auto Battles, our Pokémon are out\nthere battling for us—their Trainers![VAR 0114(0024)]
Keep an eye on them as much as possible, and\nif it looks like they’re going to lose, be sure to\r\nhave them retreat![VAR 0114(0024)]
Also, this goes without saying, but Pokémon with\nlow HP are already worn out.[VAR 0114(0024)]
They probably won’t enjoy Auto Battles as much,\nso don’t work them too hard, OK?[VAR 0114(0024)]
In conclusion![VAR 0114(0024)]
Auto Battles only work if a Trainer and their\nPokémon have a relationship of mutual trust![VAR 0114(0024)]
Be smart with how you use Auto Battles so you\ndon’t lose the trust of your Pokémon![VAR 0114(0024)]
Aw, man! I was just about to suggest we do some\nhands-on practice to really drive the point home,\r\nbut I guess we’ve run out of time, as usual...[VAR 0114(0024)]
Class is over for now! Take care, you little rascals![VAR 0114(0024)]

Text File : class_e_06
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Another day, another round of battle study! Osu!\nLet’s get right to it![VAR 0114(0024)]
I hope you gave Auto Battles a shot like we\ntalked about last class![VAR 0114(0024)]
Making good use of Auto Battles will let you train\nup a bunch of different Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0024)]
It’s also an efficient way to gather the Pokémon\nmaterials you need to make TMs at TM Machines![VAR 0114(0024)]
Speaking of which! Have you all been using the\nTM Machines?[VAR 0114(0024)]
I sure hope so, ’cause it’s pop quiz time![VAR 0114(0024)]
To create TMs, you need Pokémon materials and\none other thing. Anyone remember what that is?[VAR 0114(0024)]
LP
HP
Money
Looks like you’re already a TM Machine pro,\nnew kid![VAR 0114(0024)]
Whoa! Hold on there, new kid! Offering up HP to\ncreate TMs sounds like some kind of ritual or\r\nsomething! That’s not how it’s done![VAR 0114(0024)]
Close, new kid! Close! But don’t think that money\nmakes every little thing in the world go ’round![VAR 0114(0024)]
The correct answer is League Points—or LP\nfor short![VAR 0114(0024)]
You can give LP and Pokémon materials to a TM\nMachine to create TMs. But that’s not all!\c\nYou can also exchange Pokémon materials at a\nTM Machine to get LP![VAR 0114(0024)]
I recently heard about some shady individuals\ngetting LP illegally using a technique called...\r\nhacking? Or something like that.[VAR 0114(0024)]
I don’t want any of you getting involved in bad\nstuff like that. Got it?![VAR 0114(0024)]
Anyway, you can also add TMs that you want to\nmake to your watch list. This will let you keep an\r\neye on the materials you need to gather![VAR 0114(0024)]
In conclusion![VAR 0114(0024)]
In order to make TMs, you need Pokémon\nmaterials![VAR 0114(0024)]
And if you want to get hold of lots of materials,\nyou’ll have to battle all kinds of Pokémon![VAR 0114(0024)]
Aw, man! I was just about to suggest we do some\nhands-on practice to really drive the point home,\r\nbut I guess we’re never gonna have the time...[VAR 0114(0024)]
Class is over for now! Take care, you little rascals![VAR 0114(0024)]

Text File : class_e_07
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Osu! This is our last class, but don’t let those\nenergy levels drop before we wrap things up![VAR 0114(0024)]
You’ve shown that you have more than enough\nknowledge to be superstrong battlers![VAR 0114(0024)]
I don’t know that I have much left to teach you...[VAR 0114(0024)]
but we can always aim for ever-greater heights![VAR 0114(0024)]
So today, I’m going to teach you about the rules\nof Link Battles![VAR 0114(0024)]
When two Trainers participate in Link Battles\ntogether, they can engage in either Single Battles\r\nor Double Battles with each other![VAR 0114(0024)]
And if you’re playing in a group of four, you can\nall battle each other in Multi Battles![VAR 0114(0024)]
Now, when you’re out having battles during your\nindependent study, you can use whatever number\r\nof Pokémon you like—and they can be any level![VAR 0114(0024)]
But, in Link Battles, there are special rules to\nkeep in mind.[VAR 0114(0024)]
Some of these special rules involve adjusting\nPokémon’s levels![VAR 0114(0024)]
Now, the [VAR FF00(0006)]No Restrictions [VAR FF00(0000)]rule set lets all Pokémon\nstay at their current level.\c\nIt lets Trainers use multiple Pokémon of the same\nspecies and multiples of the same held item, too![VAR 0114(0024)]
But if you choose to use [VAR FF00(0006)]Normal Rules[VAR FF00(0000)], all\nPokémon will be set to Lv. 50 for your battles—\r\nregardless of what level they actually are.[VAR 0114(0024)]
This even includes lower-level Pokémon. They’ll\nget a power boost to participate![VAR 0114(0024)]
Normal Rules let you use multiples of the same\nPokémon species and of the same held items too.[VAR 0114(0024)]
The great part about this rule set is that it lets\nany of your Pokémon participate—all they have\r\nto do is learn some good moves![VAR 0114(0024)]
Lastly, the rule set called [VAR FF00(0006)]Flat Rules[VAR FF00(0000)] mostly affects\nPokémon over Lv. 50. Such Pokémon will be set\r\nto Lv. 50 for the duration of the battle![VAR 0114(0024)]
The Flat Rules rule set is the one often used for\nofficial tournaments.[VAR 0114(0024)]
This rule set does NOT allow Trainers to use\nmultiple Pokémon of the same species or\r\nmultiples of the same held item![VAR 0114(0024)]
All right. Here’s a question for you![VAR 0114(0024)]
Which rule set should you pick if you want to use\na lower-level Pokémon and keep its level low?[VAR 0114(0024)]
Normal Rules
Flat Rules
Oooh, gotcha there! Normal Rules adjusts all\nPokémon to Lv. 50—even lower-level ones![VAR 0114(0024)]
That’s the one, new kid! Looks like you were\nlistening to the lesson![VAR 0114(0024)]
If you’ve got some clever strategy that you need\nto use a Lv. 5 Pokémon for, your best bet is to\r\nchoose the Flat Rules rule set![VAR 0114(0024)]
Of course, you can also choose No Restrictions if\nyou want to battle with any Pokémon you want—\r\nat any level and with any held item![VAR 0114(0024)]
That’s a pretty good rule set for when you want\nto battle freely with friends.[VAR 0114(0024)]
In conclusion![VAR 0114(0024)]
Normal Rules adjusts all Pokémon to Lv. 50!\c\nFlat Rules lets you use lower-level Pokémon at\ntheir actual levels![VAR 0114(0024)]
I hope you’ll use these tips to have some exciting\nbattles with your friends![VAR 0114(0024)]
Aw, man! I was just about to suggest we do some\nhands-on practice to really drive the point home,\r\nbut I guess we truly are out of time...[VAR 0114(0024)]
Next class will be our final exam! Aim for a\nperfect score! Osu! Osu![VAR 0114(0024)]

Greetings, I am Hassel. I will be teaching this art\nclass. It is a pleasure to meet you all![VAR 0114(0012)]
Now, let me be candid for one moment.[VAR 0114(0012)]
I imagine that many of you will forget all that\nyou learned in this class once you graduate![VAR 0114(0012)]
After all, you don’t need even a basic\nunderstanding of artwork, much less a refined\r\nappreciation of beauty, for most exams or jobs.[VAR 0114(0012)]
So, is my class a waste of time for you, then?[VAR 0114(0012)]
I think not! At least, I certainly hope it isn’t![VAR 0114(0012)]
Think for a moment, all of you. What is beauty,\nanyway? What makes something beautiful?[VAR 0114(0012)]
Its shape and color
The eye of the beholder
I don’t know
Interesting... Thank you, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0012)]
Oh, I don’t mean to suggest there’s a correct\nanswer to my query. The important thing is that\r\nyou all take time to think about it.[VAR 0114(0012)]
Think about why we might find beauty in a flower\nblooming on the side of the road, for example.[VAR 0114(0012)]
Question why the sky is a different shade of blue\nthan the ocean or why the leaves change color.\c\nPonder the windmills of Artazon and how they\nmove. Contemplate the chilling bite of the\r\nwaters of Cascarrafa.[VAR 0114(0012)]
I’m sure you will find that every little detail of\nyour lives will seem more vivid, more impactful,\r\nif you just take a moment to stop and think.[VAR 0114(0012)]
And I am certain that if you stop and truly\nappreciate the little beauties of this world...[VAR 0114(0012)]
it will help pull you through the days where your\nstudies have you exhausted or when work has\r\ndampened your spirits.[VAR 0114(0012)]
Ah, do pardon me for waxing philosophical.\nYou don’t need to understand all of that now.[VAR 0114(0012)]
To put it simply, it is true that one doesn’t need\nart to survive... But it certainly makes surviving\r\nmuch more enjoyable![VAR 0114(0012)]
It is my hope that this class will add even a little\nbit of color to your lives.[VAR 0114(0012)]
That’s all for today—next time, we’ll try a more\nhands-on approach to appreciating beauty![VAR 0114(0012)]

Text File : class_f_02
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Hello, class! It is I, Hassel, yet again.[VAR 0114(0012)]
In our previous class, we discussed what beauty\nis...which might have been a little boring for you.[VAR 0114(0012)]
So today, I thought I would mix things up a little\nto pique your interest in art.[VAR 0114(0012)]
Allow me to introduce our special guest![VAR 0114(0012)]
Gib gibble.
This is Professor Gible, the assistant lecturer\nfor today.[VAR 0114(0012)]
Now then, Professor Gible. If you would be so\nkind as to Terastallize for us...[VAR 0114(0012)]
Glaaam!
As some of you may already know, a Pokémon\ncan Terastallize if you use a Tera Orb.[VAR 0114(0012)]
Normally, Professor Gible would be of the\nDragon type...[VAR 0114(0012)]
But by Terastallizing, it’s succeeded in changing\nits type![VAR 0114(0012)]
So, class...what type do these lovely, glistening\nflowers above Professor Gible’s head represent?[VAR 0114(0012)]
The Grass type
The Fire type
The Water type
[VAR BD06(0000)]Excellent, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nFull marks\r\nfor you![VAR 0114(0012)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Ah, not quite, [VAR 0100(0000)].\nActually,\r\nthe\r\ntype\r\nin\r\nquestion\r\nis\r\nweak\r\nto\r\nthe\r\nFire type![VAR 0114(0012)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Ah, not quite, [VAR 0100(0000)].\nActually,\r\nthe\r\ntype\r\nin\r\nquestion\r\nis\r\nstrong\r\nagainst\r\nthe\r\nWater type![VAR 0114(0012)]
These beautiful flowers blooming above\nProfessor Gible’s head show that it has now\r\nbecome a Grass type.[VAR 0114(0012)]
The shape of the [VAR FF00(0006)]Tera Jewel[VAR FF00(0000)] above a Pokémon’s\nhead depends on the Pokémon’s Tera Type.[VAR 0114(0012)]
To summarize! If an opponent’s Pokémon\nTerastallizes during battle...[VAR 0114(0012)]
observe a Pokémon’s Tera Jewel closely to see\nwhich type it has become![VAR 0114(0012)]
And choose effective moves accordingly![VAR 0114(0012)]
It is my sincere hope that today’s lecture will\nhelp you all achieve beautiful victories.[VAR 0114(0012)]
The Terastal phenomenon is indeed a fascinating\nand deep subject to discuss.[VAR 0114(0012)]
That is it for today, class! Thank you, Professor\nGible, for your help.[VAR 0114(0012)]
Glam-gib.

Hello, class! It is I, Hassel, yet again.[VAR 0114(0012)]
I’ve been told that my previous lecture about\nthe Terastal phenomenon was very well received.\r\nThank you all for your kind words![VAR 0114(0012)]
In fact, Ms. Dendra specifically requested that\nI impart even more battle knowledge to\r\nmy students...[VAR 0114(0012)]
So, I have decided that today we will take\nanother look at how a Pokémon can Terastallize![VAR 0114(0012)]
Gib gibble.
And of course, here is Professor Gible to help us.[VAR 0114(0012)]
Now then, Professor Gible. If you would be so\nkind as to Terastallize for us...[VAR 0114(0012)]
Glaaam!
Now, what do we have here? Last class we saw\nGrass-type Terastallizing, but this time we have\r\nsomething of a different shape.[VAR 0114(0012)]
Observe, a Tera Jewel resembling a snowflake!\nIts dendritic shape is stunning to behold.[VAR 0114(0012)]
It’s a little chilly standing so close to it...[VAR 0114(0012)]
So, class... What Tera Type do you imagine this\njewel might represent?[VAR 0114(0012)]
The Water type
The Ice type
The Ghost type
[VAR BD06(0000)]Very close, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nThis is\r\nwater...\r\nbut\r\nin\r\na\r\ndifferent state![VAR 0114(0012)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Excellent, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nFull marks\r\nfor you![VAR 0114(0012)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Ah, not exactly, [VAR 0100(0000)].\nThough\r\nI\r\nsuppose\r\nthat\r\nis\r\nchilling\r\nin\r\nits\r\nown\r\nway, too![VAR 0114(0012)]
The reason there’s a snowflake shining above\nProfessor Gible’s head is simple—it is now\r\nan Ice type![VAR 0114(0012)]
And because Professor Gible is currently the\nIce type...[VAR 0114(0012)]
Ice-type moves would not be very effective\nagainst it. Keep in mind, usually they would\r\ndeal quadruple damage to Gible![VAR 0114(0012)]
Now, here’s some trivia about snowflakes:\nwhile snowflakes come in many different shapes\r\nand sizes, most are classified as hexagons![VAR 0114(0012)]
Just think of it... Snowflakes fall from the sky,\ntaking similar shapes without anyone saying\r\nthey must.[VAR 0114(0012)]
Do you not feel the great mystery of nature?\nThe beautiful enigma we live in?![VAR 0114(0012)]
*cough*\c\nAh, this is a bit of a tangent, but Mr. Jacq’s\nglasses are also hexagonal, aren’t they.[VAR 0114(0012)]
I almost forgot to mention that you can change\na Pokémon’s Tera Type at the [VAR FF00(0006)]Treasure Eatery[VAR FF00(0000)]\r\nlocated in Medali.[VAR 0114(0012)]
Though I must say the cook there is a little...\nprickly—you’ll need to get on her good side if\r\nyou want her help.[VAR 0114(0012)]
Now, come prepared for next class, because it is\ntime for your midterm examination!\c\nThank you for today, Professor Gible.[VAR 0114(0012)]

Hello, class! It is I, Hassel, yet again.[VAR 0114(0012)]
I’m pleased to say that everybody did very well\non the midterm exams.[VAR 0114(0012)]
As a reward for all of your hard work, we have\na special guest visiting us today![VAR 0114(0012)]
Now then, Brassie, please come in![VAR 0114(0012)]
Greetings![VAR 0114(002C)]
I am Brassius. I am an artist, and I focus\nexclusively on Grass-type Pokémon for my work.[VAR 0114(0017)]
Brassius here mainly creates three-dimensional\npieces, such as statues and the like.[VAR 0114(0012)]
One of his major works is the installation titled\nSurrendering Sunflora, found in Artazon.[VAR 0114(0012)]
Many of you who’ve challenged the Artazon Gym\nare no doubt familiar with these sculptures.[VAR 0114(0012)]
Yes...I do recognize some faces among your\nstudents.[VAR 0114(0017)]
I hope you all understand how fortunate you are\nto be able to attend Hass’s classes.[VAR 0114(0017)]
Ol’ Hass is the man who saved me when I had\nlost all hope and given up on myself.[VAR 0114(0017)]
But he never gave up on me. I do not exaggerate\nwhen I say that he is my mentor in life![VAR 0114(0017)]
It is precisely thanks to Hass that I was able to\nestablish my current art style.[VAR 0114(0017)]
Ah, dear Brassie![VAR 0114(0012)]
I’ve nothing against reminiscing about old times,\nbut today, I hope you will guide this class in a\r\nway only you can![VAR 0114(0012)]
Of course![VAR 0114(0017)]
Let’s see... Ah, why don’t we discuss what Hass\nmentioned—Surrendering Sunflora?[VAR 0114(0017)]
Can anyone here tell what my mood was when I\ncrafted its detached expression?[VAR 0114(0017)]
A happy mood
A sad mood
An angry mood
No, no, no... Completely and utterly wrong![VAR 0114(0017)]
When I made that sculpture, I had surrendered\nall hope. I was prepared to give up everything.[VAR 0114(0017)]
I had resolved to give up my life as an artist if\nthat piece did not receive proper recognition.[VAR 0114(0017)]
Hence the name Surrendering Sunflora?[VAR 0114(0012)]
That’s exactly it, Hass![VAR 0114(0017)]
When I started out as an artist, I experienced\nmany hardships. I even became deathly ill and\r\nfell into a slump that drove me to desperation.[VAR 0114(0017)]
I began worrying only about what would sell.\nI was concerned only with fame and fortune...[VAR 0114(0017)]
But all of my pieces during this time had no\ndepth. They were all shallow trash![VAR 0114(0017)]
It was then that I met Hass. He helped me realize\nhow petty I was being. I’ll spare you the details...\r\nbut in the end I was able to leave all that behind![VAR 0114(0017)]
And that is also when I crafted the Sunflora![VAR 0114(0017)]
Remarkable! Even I did not know the full story\nuntil now![VAR 0114(0012)]
This kind of thing is hard to tell someone,\nespecially when they are so close to you.[VAR 0114(0017)]
Now, I don’t doubt that you adolescents will\noften find your heads crowded with worries.[VAR 0114(0017)]
My advice to you is simple. Be honest with\nyourself, and do whatever your heart desires.\r\n...So long as you don’t cause trouble, that is.[VAR 0114(0017)]
That is all from me.[VAR 0114(0017)]
I must admit I am beginning to feel a bit\nembarrassed, so I bid you farewell, Hass!\r\nAnd farewell to your pupils as well![VAR 0114(0017)]
Oh Brassie, I can’t believe it... Such a wonderful...\nclass... Thank...[VAR 0114(0012)]
THANGYU SO MUBCH![VAR 0114(0012)]
BWUUUH huh huh huh huh!\nHUUUH huh hoi hoi hoi...[VAR 0114(0012)]

Hello, class! It is I, Hassel, yet again.[VAR 0114(0012)]
First, allow me to apologize for losing my\ncomposure during our last class...[VAR 0114(0012)]
I was so touched by Brassius’s story that I simply\ncouldn’t contain my emotions. I’m sorry for\r\nmaking such a scene.[VAR 0114(0012)]
I certainly got a very stern talking-to from\nMs. Tyme after that class, yes...[VAR 0114(0012)]
Anyway, let us shift gears and dive into the\nmaterial for today’s class![VAR 0114(0012)]
Now, have any of you heard of the Ten Sights\nof Paldea?[VAR 0114(0012)]
As the name would imply, they are ten sights in\nPaldea that are considered particularly beautiful.[VAR 0114(0012)]
Among them, I would say that the[VAR FF00(0006)] Grand Olive[VAR FF00(0000)]\n[VAR FF00(0006)]Orchard[VAR FF00(0000)] is likely the most accessible.[VAR 0114(0012)]
You can see field after field of olive trees from\nthe hill on the way to Cortondo.[VAR 0114(0012)]
Two waterfalls are also counted among these\nten sights—[VAR FF00(0006)]Fury Falls[VAR FF00(0000)] and [VAR FF00(0006)]Casseroya Falls[VAR FF00(0000)].[VAR 0114(0012)]
Then there’s the peak of Glaseado Mountain,\nknown as [VAR FF00(0006)]Paldea’s Highest Peak[VAR FF00(0000)].[VAR 0114(0012)]
There’s another cliff on Glaseado Mountain that’s\nnamed after its rather unique shape.[VAR 0114(0012)]
So, let me ask you, my students![VAR 0114(0012)]
What is the name of the three-pronged cliff on\nGlaseado Mountain? No need to grasp at straws![VAR 0114(0012)]
Glaseado’s Grasp
Glaseado’s Reach
Glaseado’s Run
[VAR BD06(0000)]Exactly! It looks like a hand taking hold of\nsomething, doesn’t it, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0012)]
A very good guess! I’d think something reaching\nwould stretch out farther, though.[VAR 0114(0012)]
A unique take! But that sort of name would\nusually apply to a slope, don’t you think?[VAR 0114(0012)]
The three-pronged cliff on Glaseado Mountain\nis in fact known as [VAR FF00(0006)]Glaseado’s Grasp[VAR FF00(0000)].[VAR 0114(0012)]
Though its shape is far too stubby to be that\nof a human hand. I imagine someone thought it\r\nlooked like a Pokémon hand grabbing something.[VAR 0114(0012)]
There’s also the mountains in Area Three of the\nEast Province, where you can get a good look at\r\nLevincia. It’s particularly gorgeous at night![VAR 0114(0012)]
In fact, the view is so brilliant, it is known as the\n[VAR FF00(0006)]Million Volt Skyline[VAR FF00(0000)].[VAR 0114(0012)]
I hear it’s quite a hotspot for dates—and\ndeservedly so for having such a romantic view![VAR 0114(0012)]
I imagine it’s...what do the kids say these days...\na very, ahem, “fleek selfie spot”?[VAR 0114(0012)]
Of course, you may feel that not all ten sights live\nup to their grandiose names. How often do we\r\nvisit some tourist spot only to be disappointed?[VAR 0114(0012)]
Not to say that you shouldn’t visit them, only\nthat you should keep your hopes in check.[VAR 0114(0012)]
The important thing is to go yourself and see\nthem with your own two eyes.[VAR 0114(0012)]
And sometimes, a disappointing experience can\nbe worthwhile in its own way. Take a chance![VAR 0114(0012)]
Well, that’s it for today, class. Thank you for\nyour attention![VAR 0114(0012)]

Hello, class! It is I, Hassel, yet again.[VAR 0114(0012)]
My, my, how time flies, as they say![VAR 0114(0012)]
Indeed, our time together has certainly flown by.\nIt’s hard to believe that this is our last class.[VAR 0114(0012)]
Now, our topics for today may feel somewhat\nunrelated to art.[VAR 0114(0012)]
But there is absolutely no set definition as to\nwhat art should be![VAR 0114(0012)]
Therefore, let us carry on with the discussion and\nsee where it takes us![VAR 0114(0012)]
There are two things I wish to focus on today—\nRibbons...and marks![VAR 0114(0012)]
Both Ribbons and marks are special honors that\ncapture a Pokémon’s qualities.[VAR 0114(0012)]
There will be times when your Pokémon gives\nmaximum effort or has a noteworthy experience.[VAR 0114(0012)]
In recognition of its feats and accomplishments,\nit can be given a Ribbon.[VAR 0114(0012)]
To give an example, if you manage to become\nincredibly close to a Pokémon, it may be granted\r\nthe Best Friends Ribbon.[VAR 0114(0012)]
Incidentally, there is a person in Cascarrafa who\ncan give your Pokémon a Best Friends Ribbon.[VAR 0114(0012)]
Marks, on the other hand, are mostly found on\nwild Pokémon when you meet them for the\r\nfirst time.[VAR 0114(0012)]
They can symbolize the character of a Pokémon,\nsuch as with the Rowdy Mark or the Vigor Mark.[VAR 0114(0012)]
It’s completely up to luck whether you’ll run into\na Pokémon with these marks![VAR 0114(0012)]
So if you’re able to catch a Pokémon with a\nmark, rejoice at your outstanding fortune![VAR 0114(0012)]
Does anyone know what special thing you can do\nwith Pokémon that have Ribbons or marks?[VAR 0114(0012)]
You can exchange Ribbons!
You can show them off!
You can change their title!
Ah, unfortunately, you can’t transfer Ribbons or\nmarks from one Pokémon to another, nor can you\r\ntrade them with other people’s Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0012)]
Well, yes, indeed you can show them off, but\nsurely that’s not the extent of your interest, is it?[VAR 0114(0012)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Wonderful, [VAR 0100(0000)]! Your\nknowledge\r\nis\r\nimpressive.[VAR 0114(0012)]
The correct answer is that Pokémon with Ribbons\nor marks can be given titles.[VAR 0114(0012)]
What’s more, they can be sent into battle\ndisplaying a title of your choosing![VAR 0114(0012)]
For example, you could send out a Gible with\na Best Friends Ribbon by declaring...\r\n“Go! Gible the Great Friend!”[VAR 0114(0012)]
And while I know I just said that marks are\ngenerally found already on Pokémon when you\r\nmeet them for the first time...[VAR 0114(0012)]
it seems that more recently, Pokémon can be\nawarded certain marks based on their efforts.[VAR 0114(0012)]
These are marks such as the Gourmand Mark,\nthe Itemfinder Mark, the Partner Mark, and so on.[VAR 0114(0012)]
Perhaps it might be fun to try to work out how to\nget each mark using its name as a clue?[VAR 0114(0012)]
Well, that just about wraps up our last class![VAR 0114(0012)]
Next is the final exam. Please review our material\nclosely so that you pass on your first try![VAR 0114(0012)]

And that’s that! Good work, everyone! You can\nreceive your results from the front desk.[VAR 0114(0012)]

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I see we have some energetic young ones in our\nclass this time around.[VAR 0114(002C)]
You may call me Mr. Saguaro.\c\nYour time here with me will be spent obtaining\nknowledge and skills indispensable for daily life.[VAR 0114(0029)]
Many of you have left the care of your parents to\nlive here on your own in the academy dormitory.[VAR 0114(0029)]
I pray that the knowledge I impart to you will\nimprove the quality of your lives and the\r\nnecessities thereof—food, clothing, and shelter.[VAR 0114(0029)]
Of those three categories, I assume the most\npressing and interesting for you all is food.[VAR 0114(0029)]
When you eat sandwiches on your picnics, the HP\nof your party Pokémon will be restored.\c\nYou will also gain something called [VAR FF00(0006)]Meal Powers[VAR FF00(0000)],\nwhich can provide all manner of benefits.[VAR 0114(0029)]
For example, these powers can make Pokémon\neasier to catch or increase the Exp. Points that\r\nyour Pokémon receive.[VAR 0114(0029)]
I think you will also find that the breadth of these\neffects can be expanded by crafting sandwiches\r\nof superb flavor.[VAR 0114(0029)]
What’s more, there is a certain something that is\nparticularly important if we wish to receive Meal\r\nPowers with even more helpful effects.[VAR 0114(0029)]
Let me see... M[VAR 1100(00FF,0305)]asteriss [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nTell me—what must you keep in mind to receive\neven more helpful Meal Powers?[VAR 0114(0029)]
My choice of fillings and condiments
How fast I can prepare the food
I have to remember to put my heart into it!
[VAR BD06(0000)]Perfectly correct, M[VAR 1100(00FF,0305)]asteriss\n[VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nPerhaps you were already aware of this fact from\nhaving helped your family with cooking at home?[VAR 0114(0029)]
That is...incorrect. I pray that you all put more\nemphasis on doing things well when cooking\r\nrather than simply rushing to finish quickly.[VAR 0114(0029)]
Ha! That is an interesting take. Though not\nexactly what I was looking for, I suppose you are\r\ncorrect, in a sense.[VAR 0114(0029)]
Your choice of ingredients—including both fillings\nand condiments—is an important factor in gaining\r\neven more helpful Meal Powers.[VAR 0114(0029)]
For example, using sweet ingredients in your\nsandwiches may help you gain Egg Power.[VAR 0114(0029)]
Including numerous bitter ingredients, on the\nother hand, can gain you Item Drop Power.[VAR 0114(0029)]
Learning to aim for specific effects when crafting\nsandwiches will almost certainly make your\r\nculinary endeavors more enjoyable.\c\nPlease be aware, however, that you can also\nreceive Meal Powers by eating at restaurants.[VAR 0114(0029)]
I must say that I would feel the utmost joy if you\nall learned much here in my class and came to\r\nbetter understand home economics.[VAR 0114(0029)]
Our time together has come to an end for today.\nI bid you all farewell.[VAR 0114(0029)]

Put away your phones. It is time to begin class.[VAR 0114(0029)]
In our last class, I believe we talked about the\neffects you can get from food on your picnics.[VAR 0114(0029)]
You can receive Meal Powers and even restore\nHP for all the Pokémon in your party. It is a truly\r\nconvenient means of healing your Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0029)]
Unfortunately, as I’m sure you are aware, it is not\nsuited for use in battles—when you cannot make\r\nfood—or when you wish to restore HP quickly.[VAR 0114(0029)]
In times such as those, you should make use of\nhealing items—such as [VAR FF00(0006)]Potions[VAR FF00(0000)], which you can\r\npurchase from Poké Marts or the school store.[VAR 0114(0029)]
Healing items are immediately effective and can\nbe used anytime that you can open your Bag.\r\nThey are, however, consumed after one use.[VAR 0114(0029)]
Potions restore 20 HP, Super Potions restore\n60 HP, and Hyper Potions restore 120 HP.[VAR 0114(0029)]
The pricier the item, the more HP it will restore.\nKeep in mind how much money you have when\r\nyou are stocking up on these items.[VAR 0114(0029)]
However, unforeseen happenings are an\ninextricable part of traveling from place to place.[VAR 0114(0029)]
Imagine, if you will, the following scenario: you\nfind yourself with injured Pokémon, but you have\r\nno Potions, you are out of sandwich ingredients,\r\nand there are no Pokémon Centers nearby.[VAR 0114(0029)]
Tell me, M[VAR 1100(00FF,0305)]asteriss [VAR 0100(0000)]...\c\nWhat should you search for when in a perilous\nsituation with no way to heal your Pokémon?[VAR 0114(0029)]
A place with water
A teacher
Items on the ground
Would you hope to use the water to prepare a\nbracing meal perhaps?\c\nAs I mentioned, you have no ingredients, so even\nwith water, you would not be able to make food.[VAR 0114(0029)]
Ah, yes. Of course, if a teacher were nearby, they\ncould likely be of assistance.\c\nHowever, you must not assume that a grown up\nwill always be nearby to rush to your aid.[VAR 0114(0029)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Perfectly correct, M[VAR 1100(00FF,0305)]asteriss\n[VAR 0100(0000)]!\r\nI see\r\nyou\r\nare\r\nwell-learned\r\nin\r\nsurvival techniques.[VAR 0114(0029)]
If you see something shiny on the ground, it is\nactually an item that has been dropped there!\c\nYou may be able to find a restorative item, such\nas an Oran Berry or a Potion, in this way.[VAR 0114(0029)]
You can use the [VAR FF00(0006)]R Button[VAR FF00(0000)] to send out your\nPokémon to pick up such items as well.[VAR 0114(0029)]
And then there are Berries, of course.\c\nBerries, by the way, aren’t like items from shops—\nif you let your Pokémon hold one, it will decide\r\non its own when to eat the Berry during battle.[VAR 0114(0029)]
Letting your Pokémon decide this timing for itself\ncan be quite interesting![VAR 0114(0029)]
At any rate, if you find yourself in need of\nhealing, I suggest that you look around for\r\nshining items on the ground.[VAR 0114(0029)]
If you can’t find such items, there are other\nmethods you may employ for healing your—\c\nAh, but I see the bell demands that topic wait.[VAR 0114(0029)]
Our time together has come to an end for today.\nI bid you all farewell.[VAR 0114(0029)]

Put away your phones. It is time to begin class.[VAR 0114(0029)]
In my last class, I taught about HP restoration.[VAR 0114(0029)]
However, after class, I was asked by several of\nyou about [VAR FF00(0006)]Power Points[VAR FF00(0000)], commonly known as [VAR FF00(0006)]PP[VAR FF00(0000)].[VAR 0114(0029)]
When a Pokémon loses all of its HP, it faints and\ncan no longer battle![VAR 0114(0029)]
What, then, happens to a Pokémon when it loses\nall of its PP?[VAR 0114(0029)]
It can’t use moves
It won’t listen to its Trainer
All of its stats get lowered
[VAR BD06(0000)]Perfectly correct, M[VAR 1100(00FF,0305)]asteriss\n[VAR 0100(0000)]!\r\nPerhaps\r\nyou\r\nknow\r\nthis\r\nfrom\r\nfirsthand experience?[VAR 0114(0029)]
That would certainly be a dangerous situation,\nbut that is not the correct answer.\c\nWhether a Pokémon listens to its Trainer depends\non the number of Gym Badges the Trainer has.[VAR 0114(0029)]
That would certainly be a dangerous situation,\nbut that is not the correct answer.\c\nThat is not the sort of power we are talking\nabout when we talk of Power Points.[VAR 0114(0029)]
When a Pokémon runs out of PP, it can no longer\nuse its moves.[VAR 0114(0029)]
However, each move has its own store of PP, so\nyou can mitigate PP loss by using a variety of\r\nmoves rather than just one move repeatedly.[VAR 0114(0029)]
If a Pokémon loses all PP for all of its moves, it\nwill only be able to use Struggle—an action that\r\nalso damages the Pokémon that uses it.[VAR 0114(0029)]
In order to avoid this predicament, PP can be\nrestored at Pokémon Centers along with HP.[VAR 0114(0029)]
Items such as Ethers and Max Ethers can also be\nused to restore PP. Be careful not to confuse\r\nPotions with Ethers in the heat of battle![VAR 0114(0029)]
However, Ethers are not sold at shops, so you\nshould use them judiciously if you find them.[VAR 0114(0029)]
The stronger the move, the lower its maximum PP.\c\nDo not waste uses of these moves unless you wish\nto quickly run out of PP. It is important to find\r\nbalance in a Pokémon’s set of moves.[VAR 0114(0029)]
As you can see, HP isn’t the only thing you must\nkeep an eye on while adventuring with Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0029)]
I hope that you will all take care to ensure that\nyour partner Pokémon can perform at their best\r\nas you each engage in the Treasure Hunt.[VAR 0114(0029)]
Our time together has come to an end for today.\nOur next meeting will be an examination day.\r\nBe sure to review well in preparation.[VAR 0114(0029)]

Put away your phones. It is time to begin class.[VAR 0114(0029)]
Though some of you had to retake the midterm\nexam multiple times, I am glad to say that the\r\nmajority of the class passed without issue.[VAR 0114(0029)]
I feel honored to see that the knowledge and\nskills indispensable for daily life have taken root\r\nin all of you.[VAR 0114(0029)]
I trust that you will all work just as hard on your\nlife skills in this second half of our course as well.[VAR 0114(0029)]
Let us now turn our attention to the topic of the\nday, which was inspired by a question I received\r\non the subject of Meal Powers.[VAR 0114(0029)]
The student who asked this question is a young\nman who enjoys the culinary arts.[VAR 0114(0029)]
He tells me that he regularly researches culinary\ntechniques on his own and pays careful attention\r\nto the ingredients he uses.[VAR 0114(0029)]
He also spends day and night studying all aspects\nof the culinary arts.[VAR 0114(0029)]
Yet despite this, he is baffled by his inability to\nincrease the effectiveness of his Meal Powers.[VAR 0114(0029)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]So tell me, M[VAR 1100(00FF,0305)]asteriss [VAR 0100(0000)],\nsince\r\nyou\r\ndid\r\nquite\r\nwell\r\non\r\nyour\r\nmidterm\r\nexam...[VAR 0114(0029)]
What should Ar—ahem, this young man—do to\nincrease the effectiveness of his Meal Powers?[VAR 0114(0029)]
He should make food more often
He should make food with other people
Ar...ven?
The culinary arts are not so easily grasped.\nSimply engaging in them more often will not\r\nnecessarily reward you with success.[VAR 0114(0029)]
Perfectly correct. I see that you are\nknowledgeable about the culinary arts.[VAR 0114(0029)]
Ahem... I cannot disclose the identity of this\ncertain male student who enjoys the culinary arts.\r\nIt may very well be Arven, but it may not be![VAR 0114(0029)]
To increase the effectiveness of Meal Powers,\nyour sandwiches must be filled with many\r\ndifferent ingredients.[VAR 0114(0029)]
For a single person, this may prove difficult. But\nif you prepare a sandwich with others, you will\r\nbe able to handle a larger serving of bread.[VAR 0114(0029)]
With a larger base to start with, it becomes quite\nsimple to add more ingredients to your sandwich.[VAR 0114(0029)]
Which, in turn, makes it possible to receive Meal\nPowers of increased effectiveness.[VAR 0114(0029)]
This applies more broadly as well. When dealing\nwith a difficult issue, working with others to solve\r\nthat issue may be the best course of action.[VAR 0114(0029)]
I am sure that Arven will likewise work with\nfriends to craft his sandwiches in the future.[VAR 0114(0029)]
Ahem... The identity of the male student is a\nmatter of privacy, so I would ask that you do not\r\npry too deeply.[VAR 0114(0029)]
Our time together has come to an end for today.\nI bid you all farewell.[VAR 0114(0029)]

Put away your phones. It is time to begin class.[VAR 0114(0029)]
While you’re out performing fieldwork with one\nof your Pokémon walking alongside you...[VAR 0114(0029)]
have you ever noticed changes in its coloration?[VAR 0114(0029)]
Now I don’t mean that it suddenly becomes a\nShiny Pokémon or any nonsense like that.[VAR 0114(0029)]
I am speaking of it becoming filthy![VAR 0114(0029)]
Pokémon battle! They get hurt by moves used\nagainst them![VAR 0114(0029)]
They get battered by wind and rain! They get\ncovered in sand and mud![VAR 0114(0029)]
They get, in a word, filthy![VAR 0114(0029)]
I have seen many a Trainer walking about with\ntheir adorable little Pokémon without addressing\r\nthis issue. It is deplorable.[VAR 0114(0029)]
Let me ask this question of someone who I am\nsure would not tolerate such shameful conduct.\r\nAh yes, M[VAR 1100(00FF,0305)]asteriss [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0029)]
What should you do if your Pokémon is dirty?[VAR 0114(0029)]
Clean it up
Pat it on the head
Nothing
Perfectly correct! I knew I could count on you to\nprovide me with such an answer.[VAR 0114(0029)]
While patting your Pokémon on the head to\nexpress appreciation for its hard work would\r\nmake for an adorable moment, that would not\r\nclean it of its filth![VAR 0114(0029)]
I suppose, in time, filth accumulated from rain\nand mud may well fall of its own accord...but I\r\nnever expected such an answer from you.[VAR 0114(0029)]
When your Pokémon are dirty, clean them!\nThis is, of course, simply common sense.[VAR 0114(0029)]
While you are having a picnic, you can approach\nthe Pokémon on your team and perform a\r\nvariety of actions.[VAR 0114(0029)]
One such action is putting them through what I\nlike to call the “Pokémon Wash”... In other words,\r\nyou are able to clean them up![VAR 0114(0029)]
You start by getting your sponge lathered up with\nsoapy bubbles as you gently and carefully scrub\r\nyour Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0029)]
Once your Pokémon is nice and covered in\nsoapy bubbles...[VAR 0114(0029)]
the bubbles will encapsulate the filth, then you\nsimply wash it away with a spray of water![VAR 0114(0029)]
This will get your Pokémon clean and shining\nbright as a Tera Jewel![VAR 0114(0029)]
It is certainly quite a bit of work, but this will\nalso restore HP and cure status conditions.[VAR 0114(0029)]
However, some Pokémon may have parts of their\nbodies that they don’t want scrubbed or that\r\nthey would rather not get wet.\c\nBe sure to keep this in mind when cleaning your\nPokémon.[VAR 0114(0029)]
Now, the most important point that I must\nmention is that some Pokémon LIKE to be dirty.[VAR 0114(0029)]
Though I will contradict myself by saying this,\nplease do remember that cleaning your Pokémon\r\nis not always the kind thing to do.[VAR 0114(0029)]
Our time together has come to an end for today.\nI bid you all farewell.[VAR 0114(0029)]

Put away your phones. It is time to begin our last\nclass together.[VAR 0114(0029)]
Home economics is the study of life’s necessities,\nbut looking back on our time together, I realize\r\nthat I focused almost entirely on food.[VAR 0114(0029)]
I hope it is not too late to shift to a discussion of\nclothing—another necessity—in our last class.[VAR 0114(0029)]
As I’m sure you are aware, our academy has an\nair of freedom about it.[VAR 0114(0029)]
We provide uniforms for each season to\naccommodate the diverse climate of Paldea.\c\nHowever, students are free to wear whichever\nstyle they wish whenever they please.[VAR 0114(0029)]
You should all have received four sets of tops\nand bottoms—one each for spring, summer, fall,\r\nand winter—when the academy accepted you.[VAR 0114(0029)]
If, by chance, you were not aware of this, you\nmay wish to peruse your wardrobe.[VAR 0114(0029)]
As long as you wear our school uniform, the rest\nof your ensemble need not be school-issued.[VAR 0114(0029)]
This includes your bag or your hat, if you choose\nto wear one. You are even free to style your hair\r\nhowever you wish.[VAR 0114(0029)]
Mr. Salvatore’s hairstyle, for example, would\nalmost certainly have been against school rules\r\nwhen I was a boy.[VAR 0114(0029)]
That reminds me...[VAR 0114(0029)]
There is one more thing you all like to decorate,\nwhich—I must say—I find quite charming.[VAR 0114(0029)]
Our classroom desks?
Our dorm rooms?
Our Rotom Phones?
No, not that. I speak of something smaller and far\nmore adorable...\c\nMore importantly, your desk is not different or\ncustomized in the slightest![VAR 0114(0029)]
No, not that. I speak of something smaller and far\nmore adorable...\c\nMore importantly, how you decorate the interior\nof your dorm rooms is none of my business![VAR 0114(0029)]
Perfectly correct! That’s the adorable little thing\nI was speaking of! Ohhh, it interests me so![VAR 0114(0029)]
I must admit that I am fascinated by Rotom\nPhones and how to customize them![VAR 0114(0029)]
What’s that...? How very intriguing!\c\nSo there’s a shop called Delibird Presents, where\nyou can purchase cases for your Rotom Phones![VAR 0114(0029)]
I thank you for that useful bit of information...[VAR 0114(0029)]
I shall have to go myself first thing tomorrow to\nget an adorable case of my own liking.[VAR 0114(0029)]
Forgive me... I seem to have gotten a little\ncarried away with this small talk.[VAR 0114(0029)]
Ahem. As this class known as home economics\nnears its end, I offer these final words to you who\r\nhave been honing everyday life skills with me.[VAR 0114(0029)]
My field of study is not so decisive as the likes\nof mathematics, for instance, where test scores\r\nmight play a part in deciding your future.[VAR 0114(0029)]
However, as you go on to cook for yourselves,\nto take care of your Pokémon, to decide what to\r\nwear in the morning when you awaken...[VAR 0114(0029)]
I would be honored if what I have taught you\nserves to smoothen out and enrich your lives,\r\neven if only a little.\c\nThis sentiment was imparted to me by Mr. Hassel\nand his particular outlook on such matters.[VAR 0114(0029)]
I thank you all from the bottom of my heart for\nseeing this class through to the end.[VAR 0114(0029)]
Our time together has come to a close for today.\nPrepare to do your best on our final exam.[VAR 0114(0029)]

Oh! Well, if isn’t my pal [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nI’d actually love to grab your ear for something,\nbut...just look at how many Pokémon you’ve got!\c\nThink you could make some space in your Boxes\nor your team, then come talk to me again?[VAR 0114(002A)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Oh, hello, hello, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nEnjoying\r\nthat\r\nschool\r\ntrip,\r\nare\r\nyou?[VAR 0114(002A)]
Mr. Jacq?!
Why’re you—?!
Hehe... I came to check on how you’re doing!\nI AM your homeroom teacher, after all.[VAR 0114(002A)]
Once I got here, I decided to do a bit of\nresearch on the Pokémon of Kitakami, and—[VAR 0114(002A)]
Oh! That’s right! Sorry![VAR 0114(002A)]
I got so engrossed in my own research that I\nactually forgot to come find you, didn’t I![VAR 0114(002A)]
Well, how about I make up for it by treating you\nto a picnic?[VAR 0114(002A)]
I thought something like this might happen,\nso I borrowed all the usual picnic things from\r\nDirector Clavell.[VAR 0114(002A)]
Dig in! I hope you like the sandwich I made![VAR 0114(002A)]
It may, um, look a bit strange—but I can assure\nyou it tastes great![VAR 0114(002A)]
I don’t get out much, so this kind of fieldwork\nsure wears me out quick...[VAR 0114(002A)]
I can’t believe how you kids run all over the place\nfor your Treasure Hunt! You’re really something![VAR 0114(002A)]
Oh...? Could there be something in my basket?[VAR 0114(002A)]
Feast your eyes on that![VAR 0114(002A)]
A Pokémon Egg appeared in the basket![VAR 0114(002A)]
Quite the mystery, isn’t it? I only brought Gulpin\nto this picnic with me, and yet...[VAR 0114(002A)]
How could it have appeared, then?
Did you put the Egg in the basket?
Hehe... OK, I confess! Truth is, I had this Egg\nwith me the whole time.[VAR 0114(002A)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Hehe... I can’t get anything past you, can I,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(002A)]
You know about the Pokémon Eggs you can find\nduring picnics, right?[VAR 0114(002A)]
Whenever a Trainer doesn’t have the means to\ncare for an Egg they find, they can have it sent to\r\nthe academy, where we’ll take care of it.[VAR 0114(002A)]
But then I thought, “Say, wouldn’t it be better to\nhave a great Trainer raise the Pokémon instead?”\r\nSo I brought this Egg with me![VAR 0114(002A)]
And now...it’s yours, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(002A)]
You were entrusted with the Pokémon Egg!
[VAR BD06(0000)]Hehe... I know it’s odd of me to come all the way\nto Kitakami just to hand over a Pokémon Egg.\c\nBut I knew it would be safe with you,\n[VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(002A)]
That reminds me—are you still using your\nPokédex app over here too?[VAR 0114(002A)]
You should be able to fill the Kitakami Pokédex\nby catching Pokémon that live around here.[VAR 0114(002A)]
I’ll be doing fieldwork in the area for a while...[VAR 0114(002A)]
so let me know if you manage to complete the\nKitakami Pokédex in your app![VAR 0114(002A)]

Oh, the positive energy is positively flowing!\nI’d just love to buy up all this Kitakami air![VAR 0114(002C)]
That’s my dearest O’Nare! Even while out in the\nboonies, your ideas are still purely metropolitan![VAR 0114(002C)]
I do appreciate your willingness to speak\nthe truth, Billy![VAR 0114(0041)]
So, my dearest O’Nare! However shall we waste\nour time and our money today?[VAR 0114(0040)]
How, indeed...[VAR 0114(0041)]
Billy, look—a commoner! They’re staring at us...[VAR 0114(0041)]
Eh? A commoner?[VAR 0114(0040)]
Why yes, your eyes do not decieve you—that\nthere is almost certainly a commoner![VAR 0114(0040)]
As I live and breathe—a commoner! A living,\nbreathing commoner![VAR 0114(0041)]
Wh-whatever do we do, Billy?! Is it bad manners\nto ask to shake their hand? Is it acceptable to\r\nask for an autograph?![VAR 0114(0041)]
Collect yourself, my dear O’Nare! No need to\nrush. Look! This commoner isn’t going anywhere![VAR 0114(0040)]
My apologies... It’s not every day that I come\nface-to-face with a commoner, you see.[VAR 0114(0041)]
Naturally—you’re the president of Paldea Realty,\nafter all![VAR 0114(0040)]
Excuse me? Yes, you—commoner![VAR 0114(0041)]
Would you be so kind as to indulge me in a duel\nwith your Pokémon?[VAR 0114(0041)]
If you can defeat me, I will grant you riches\nbeyond your wildest imagination![VAR 0114(0041)]
Th-there it is! O’Nare’s favorite pastime—[VAR 0114(0040)]
throwing the common folk a bone![VAR 0114(0040)]
Ohoho... Please come see me once you’re ready,\ndear commoner.[VAR 0114(0041)]
If you want the great fortune O’Nare offered,\nyou should go speak to her, dear commoner.[VAR 0114(0040)]
Will you duel me for riches beyond your wildest\nimagination?[VAR 0114(0041)]
You know, I think I quite like it when a commoner\ntells me no now and then...\c\nBut the time of a Glitterati is exceedingly\nvaluable! We will have this battle RIGHT NOW![VAR 0114(0041)]
I, O’Nare—the president of Paldea Realty—will\ncrush you, commoner![VAR 0114(0041)]
Pfwee, pfwee! Go get ’em, O’Nare![VAR 0114(0040)]
You’re really something! A commoner a cut\nabove the rest![VAR 0114(0041)]
Pfwee, pfwee! Not even defeat can eclipse your\nbeauty, O’Nare![VAR 0114(0040)]
Now listen to me, commoner: the most important\nthing about money is how you use it.[VAR 0114(0041)]
Spend that reward on something meaningful—an\ninvestment in yourself.[VAR 0114(0041)]
That way, you’ll continue to sparkle, even when\nyour money is gone![VAR 0114(0041)]
Come now, dear Billy! I think I’d quite like to go\nsee [VAR FF00(0006)]that waterfall[VAR FF00(0000)] in Paldea![VAR 0114(0041)]
Pfwee! We’ve only just arrived in Kitakami, yet\nnow we’re returning home! You really are an\r\nexemplary Glitterati![VAR 0114(0040)]
Oh, my dear Mr. Billy and Lady O’Nare... Where\nin the world are you?
Lady O’Nare said something about a place with a\nview of the bountiful fields of the countryside...\r\nbut where is that?

Ooohohoho! Ooohohoho![VAR 0114(0041)]
So this is one of those Ten Sights of Paldea that\nI’ve heard so much about...[VAR 0114(0041)]
You are correct, my dearest O’Nare! These are\nthe Fury Falls![VAR 0114(0040)]
I had expected something a bit more...grandiose.[VAR 0114(0041)]
I can really feel the positive energy though,\ndullness notwithstanding.[VAR 0114(0041)]
As positive as ever, my dearest O’Nare![VAR 0114(0040)]
Not only can I feel the positive energy flowing, I\ndaresay there’s Glitterati energy in the air as well![VAR 0114(0040)]
Truly, your Glitterati aura fills the air with a sense\nof rejuvenation! Pfwee, pfwee![VAR 0114(0040)]
Thank you for speaking the truth as always, Billy.[VAR 0114(0041)]
Hold on—isn’t that our dear commoner? The one\nfrom before?[VAR 0114(0041)]
Your eyes do not deceive you. That is indeed our\ndear commoner—the one from before![VAR 0114(0040)]
Could it be fate? Coincidence? Or maybe you’ve\nbeen drawn here by our Glitterati energy![VAR 0114(0040)]
Oooohoho! Indeed, indeed![VAR 0114(0041)]
It’s our duty as Glitterati to make the dreams of\nthe common folk a reality.[VAR 0114(0041)]
Or more specifically, to give them fine items.[VAR 0114(0041)]
Now, do pay attention, dear commoner. Money\nisn’t too dissimilar from positive energy.[VAR 0114(0041)]
When you’re surrounded by it, it may bring you\ncalm and stability...[VAR 0114(0041)]
BUT! You’ll never know for sure whether that\nhappiness you feel is true or not![VAR 0114(0041)]
O’Nare, please! Such pearls of wisdom are too\nprofound for a mere child![VAR 0114(0040)]
Come, Billy! I want to go someplace more...\n[VAR FF00(0006)]remote[VAR FF00(0000)]! A place that is not famous or renowned\r\nor anything![VAR 0114(0041)]
Pfwee! We’ve been to so many landmarks that\nshe’s tired of it! You really are an exemplary\r\nGlitterati, dearest O’Nare![VAR 0114(0040)]
I know just the place! It’s by the border between\nthe South Province’s Area Five and Area One![VAR 0114(0040)]
Mr. Billy and Lady O’Nare went to the famous\nwaterfall in Area Two of Paldea’s North Province.

Ooohohoho! Ooohohoho![VAR 0114(0041)]
What an utterly dull place! Not a thing worth\nseeing![VAR 0114(0041)]
It’s just what I wanted! Thank you, Billy![VAR 0114(0041)]
Wonderful! Nothing brings me more joy than\nmaking you happy, dearest O’Nare![VAR 0114(0040)]
Perhaps I should buy up all this land and start\nsome kind of business here...[VAR 0114(0041)]
Oh? Why, if it isn’t our dear commoner![VAR 0114(0041)]
Your eyes do not deceive you—that is indeed our\ndear commoner![VAR 0114(0040)]
You really have a way of drawing people to you\nwith your charming personality, dearest O’Nare![VAR 0114(0040)]
Oooohohoho! I won’t say you’re wrong![VAR 0114(0041)]
It’s our duty as Glitterati to make the dreams of\nthe common folk a reality.[VAR 0114(0041)]
Or more specifically, to give them fine items.[VAR 0114(0041)]
Now, do pay attention, dear commoner. You\nwould do well to search for riches in areas where\r\nthere appears to be nothing of value at all...[VAR 0114(0041)]
Possibilities are as vast as the ocean, no matter\nwhere you go.[VAR 0114(0041)]
S-striking! Your words are as pickaxe to rock,\nloosing nuggets of wisdom from common stone![VAR 0114(0040)]
Come now, Billy! I have a major craving for [VAR FF00(0006)]fruit[VAR FF00(0000)]\nonly the land of Kitakami can provide.[VAR 0114(0041)]
Pfwee! No sooner did we depart than we shall\nreturn! You really are an exemplary Glitterati,\r\nmy dearest O’Nare![VAR 0114(0040)]
Those Kitakami apples make the best apple juice,\nyou know—I’ll whip some up for you![VAR 0114(0040)]
Mr. Billy and Lady O’Nare are somewhere near\nthe border between the South Province’s Area\r\nFive and Area One.

Ooohohoho! Ooohohoho![VAR 0114(0041)]
Look, Billy! What a wonderful little garden![VAR 0114(0041)]
Though this may look like a small garden to you,\ndearest O’Nare, it is in fact a full orchard![VAR 0114(0040)]
Come now—this? An orchard? You must be\njoking! I’ve never seen one so...humble![VAR 0114(0041)]
Thank you for the correction, Billy.[VAR 0114(0041)]
No trouble at all! The ways of the commoner are\nshrouded in mystery...[VAR 0114(0040)]
Ah, commoners! Such compelling creatures!\nThey always manage to get my heart racing![VAR 0114(0041)]
Hmm...? Speaking of commoners, isn’t that the\none we keep running into?[VAR 0114(0041)]
You’re right! Your eyes do not deceive you—\nit’s the commoner we keep running into![VAR 0114(0040)]
Commoner! I wish to know more about you—to\nbecome more familiar with you![VAR 0114(0041)]
With that in mind, would you do me the honor of\nhaving another duel?[VAR 0114(0041)]
Th-there it is! O’Nare’s favorite pastime—getting\nto know others through battle![VAR 0114(0040)]
Ohoho... Do let me know when you’re ready to\nduel, dear commoner.[VAR 0114(0041)]
A duel with a Glitterati is a once-in-a-lifetime\nopportunity! Quickly, speak with O’Nare![VAR 0114(0040)]
A duel with yours truly! Do you accept?[VAR 0114(0041)]
You know, I think I quite like it when a commoner\ntells me no now and then...\c\nBut the time of a Glitterati is exceedingly\nvaluable! We will have this battle RIGHT NOW![VAR 0114(0041)]
I, O’Nare—the president of Paldea Realty—will\ncrush you, commoner![VAR 0114(0041)]
Pfwee, pfwee! Go get ’em, O’Nare![VAR 0114(0040)]
I’ve lost again! Just what kind of commoner are\nyou, really?[VAR 0114(0041)]
Say, Billy—do all commoners have Pokémon this\nstrong, or is this one...special?[VAR 0114(0041)]
O’Nare, that commoner must have something\nonly a select few commoners possess.[VAR 0114(0040)]
I believe they call it...gum-shun![VAR 0114(0040)]
“Gum-shun”...? Oh! Oh yes! I’ve heard of this!\nYes, the commoners say it is the one thing no\r\nGlitterati could ever possess!\c\nHowever, Billy, I do believe the word is\n“gumption.”[VAR 0114(0041)]
A commoner with gumption... Brilliant. As\neye-catching as a Pearl String. It’s no wonder\r\nI couldn’t best you.[VAR 0114(0041)]
Speaking of pearls...I’d quite like to spend some\ntime by the waterside![VAR 0114(0041)]
Come, Billy! Let us make our way to the [VAR FF00(0006)]biggest[VAR FF00(0000)]\n[VAR FF00(0006)]body of water [VAR FF00(0000)]in all of Paldea this instant![VAR 0114(0041)]
Pfwee! Your curiosity can be piqued at a\nmoment’s notice! You really are an exemplary\r\nGlitterati, dearest O’Nare![VAR 0114(0040)]
Nothing washes away the weariness of battle\nlike a little R and R on an island shore![VAR 0114(0040)]
Lady O’Nare and Mr. Billy have gone off to see\na fruit farm somewhere here in Kitakami.

Ooohohoho! Ooohohoho![VAR 0114(0041)]
Look, Billy! Look at this puddle![VAR 0114(0041)]
This is no puddle, my dearest O’Nare! This is the\nfamed Casseroya Lake—the largest lake in Paldea![VAR 0114(0040)]
Y-you’re telling me this is a lake?! Surely it can’t\nbe more than a pond![VAR 0114(0041)]
Say, Billy—what’s the difference between a lake\nand a pond, anyway?[VAR 0114(0041)]
I’m not sure, dearest O’Nare... We Glitterati\ndon’t tend to clutter our heads with such trivial\r\ncommon knowledge...[VAR 0114(0040)]
Hm...? Why, it’s the commoner we always see\naround![VAR 0114(0041)]
You’re right! Your eyes do not deceive you—\nit’s the commoner we always see around![VAR 0114(0040)]
While we have you, dear commoner, do tell...\nWhat exactly is the difference between a pond\r\nand a lake?[VAR 0114(0041)]
Their size?
Their depth?
Ah, of course! Most impressive! You’re as well-\nversed in common knowledge as I’d hoped![VAR 0114(0041)]
It’s our duty as Glitterati to return the kindness\nwe are given...[VAR 0114(0041)]
Or more specifically, to return that kindness with\nfine items.[VAR 0114(0041)]
Now, do pay attention, dear commoner...\nHappiness is like a body of water.[VAR 0114(0041)]
It can be a puddle, a pond, or even a lake. It all\ndepends on how you think about it.[VAR 0114(0041)]
That’s my dearest O’Nare! Taking the knowledge\nsomeone just taught you and putting it on display\r\nright in front of them![VAR 0114(0040)]
Come now, Billy! I’d like to scale [VAR FF00(0006)]a lofty mountain[VAR FF00(0000)]\n[VAR FF00(0006)]with pure, white snow[VAR FF00(0000)]—as pure and lofty as the\r\nideals of our company![VAR 0114(0041)]
Pfwee! It’s true that Paldea Realty has the purest,\nloftiest ideals! Dearest O’Nare, you truly are an\r\nexemplary Glitterati![VAR 0114(0040)]
Now, let’s go enjoy some gelato while watching\nice Pokémon frolic atop a snowy mountain![VAR 0114(0040)]
Mr. Billy and Lady O’Nare have gone off to a\nlarge body of water in Paldea...
What could that mean, “a large body of water”?\nA river? A pond? Or maybe even a lake...?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Text File : s1_sub_008
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Ooohohoho! Ooohohoho![VAR 0114(0041)]
A world of silvery white as far as the eye can see!\nTruly a view worthy of a Glitterati![VAR 0114(0041)]
Sure is! And the cold is no match for these\nclothes you prepared for me, dearest O’Nare![VAR 0114(0040)]
Of course! They’re made from the highest-quality\nmaterials by the highest-quality brand, after all![VAR 0114(0041)]
I feel sorry for people who climb this mountain\nin anything less...[VAR 0114(0040)]
Hm...? Can it be?! Has our dearest commoner\nreturned to us once more?![VAR 0114(0041)]
You’re right! Your eyes do not deceive you—our\ndearest commoner has returned to us once more![VAR 0114(0040)]
Look, dearest O’Nare! Look at how thin the\nmaterial on our dearest commoner’s clothes is![VAR 0114(0040)]
Oh my! That’s awfully flimsy, isn’t it?![VAR 0114(0041)]
Say, Billy—do you suppose commoners have an\neasier time dealing with the cold?[VAR 0114(0041)]
I’m not sure... But I’ve heard that commoners say\nwe Glitterati “line our pockets with money.”\c\nPerhaps that means the high quality of our\nclothing is unusual to them?[VAR 0114(0040)]
If all commoners dress like our dearest one here,\nthen they must simply be used to the cold![VAR 0114(0040)]
Billy, you’re...[VAR 0114(0041)]
you’re a true erudite! For this, I shall grant you\nthe Gold O’Nare Award![VAR 0114(0041)]
YESSSS![VAR 0114(0040)]
It’s our duty as Glitterati to lend a hand to the\nstruggling common folk.[VAR 0114(0041)]
In that spirit, I grant you these fine items. Hang\nin there and tough out the cold![VAR 0114(0041)]
Now, you listen carefully, dear commoner. You\nmay have heard the saying “Cold hands, warm\r\nheart”... Don’t be fooled! It’s a load of hogwash![VAR 0114(0041)]
You must never, ever forget that![VAR 0114(0041)]
That’s my dearest O’Nare! Your aphorisms are\nbecoming more off-the-cuff by the day![VAR 0114(0040)]
Come now, Billy! It’s about time our reprieve\ncame to a close.[VAR 0114(0041)]
I want to finish it with a look down at the\n[VAR FF00(0006)]centermost point of Paldea[VAR FF00(0000)]![VAR 0114(0041)]
Pfwee! Even the most extraordinary places are\nonly worthy of being looked down upon by you!\r\nYou really are an exemplary Glitterati, O’Nare![VAR 0114(0040)]
We probably can’t get into the Great Crater, but\nlet’s make a request to the League, just in case![VAR 0114(0040)]
Mr. Billy and Lady O’Nare went to climb a\nmountain covered in snow as pure as our\r\ncompany’s ideals.
Whether our company truly has pure ideals is\nup for debate—but no one will argue the purity\r\nof Glaseado Mountain’s snow!

Ooohohoho! Ooohohoho![VAR 0114(0041)]
So this is the very center of Paldea! What an\nenormous crater![VAR 0114(0041)]
That’s exactly right, dearest O’Nare! This right\nhere is the Great Crater of Paldea![VAR 0114(0040)]
It seems we have a new adventure to quench my\nwanderlust, Billy! Come, let’s begin our descent![VAR 0114(0041)]
We mustn’t, dearest O’Nare! Entering the crater\nis strictly forbidden! I petitioned the League for\r\naccess, but to no avail...[VAR 0114(0040)]
I beg your pardon?! They won’t even let a\nGlitterati enter?[VAR 0114(0041)]
They won’t even let a Glitterati enter![VAR 0114(0040)]
But this was to be the conclusion to our retreat!\nAnd we’ve been as good as gold and better!\c\nI never imagined there would be something in\nthis world off-limits to a Glitterati...[VAR 0114(0041)]
Hm...? Why, it’s that commoner who can’t seem\nto get enough of us![VAR 0114(0041)]
You’re right! Your eyes do not deceive you—\nit’s that commoner who can’t get enough of us![VAR 0114(0040)]
Say, dear commoner... Have you entered this\ncrater before, perchance?[VAR 0114(0041)]
I have!
Nope
Rags to riches! This commoner’s had the fortune\nto enter the crater, but the Glitterati have not?![VAR 0114(0041)]
If neither the common folk nor the Glitterati are\nallowed inside, just who is?! I don’t understand![VAR 0114(0041)]
Well, then. It seems we have no choice but\nto duel.[VAR 0114(0041)]
Th-there it is! O’Nare’s favorite pastime—\nchallenging others to a duel like a Thunderbolt\r\nfrom the blue![VAR 0114(0040)]
But this really isn’t the place for a battle. Let’s\nhead back down![VAR 0114(0041)]
Ohoho... Do inform me when you’re ready to\nduel, commoner.[VAR 0114(0041)]
This must feel like a Thunderbolt from the blue,\nbut you should battle dearest O’Nare—lightning\r\nnever strikes the same place twice, after all![VAR 0114(0040)]
One last duel—what do you say?[VAR 0114(0041)]
You know, I think I quite like it when a commoner\ntells me no now and then...\c\nBut the time of a Glitterati is exceedingly\nvaluable! We will have this battle RIGHT NOW![VAR 0114(0041)]
I, O’Nare—the president of Paldea Realty—will\ncrush you, commoner![VAR 0114(0041)]
[~ 42]
You know, I’ve had time to calm down, and I\nthink I finally get it now...[VAR 0114(0041)]
Glitterati, commoners...in the end, we’re all just\npeople. There’s nothing separating us.[VAR 0114(0041)]
Why did it take me so long to realize something\nso simple?[VAR 0114(0041)]
I’m so embarrassed... I wish I could crawl under\na rock and hide. I couldn’t literally crawl under\r\na rock, of course, but you know what I mean.[VAR 0114(0041)]
Oh, O’Nare...[VAR 0114(0040)]
You were following us around just to teach us\nthat, weren’t you?[VAR 0114(0041)]
As expected! I’m not sure why I even asked.[VAR 0114(0041)]
I can’t express my appreciation enough...\nBut I hope that these fine items can suffice?[VAR 0114(0041)]
You received the [VAR FF00(0008)]Glitterati Case[VAR FF00(0000)]!
Now then, Billy! I feel as though I’ve grown as a\nperson during this trip.[VAR 0114(0041)]
Starting tomorrow, I’m turning over a new leaf! I’ll\nresume my work as CEO, holding nothing back![VAR 0114(0041)]
Pfwee! Learning from your failures like a pro!\nYou really are an exemplary Glitterati![VAR 0114(0040)]
Now, since you’ve taught us a little something, I’ll\nteach you a little something![VAR 0114(0040)]
You learned the [VAR FF00(0008)]Oh No! emote[VAR FF00(0000)] from Billy!
Right, then... Adiós![VAR 0114(003A)]
Lady O’Nare and Mr. Billy went to go see the\ncentermost part of Paldea.
I guess that means they’d be making their way to\nthe Great Crater...
I can’t imagine they’d try to climb down, but...\nI’m a little worried. Could you go check on them?

Hello, hello, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(002A)]
Looks like you’ve caught...[VAR 0202(0001)] kind[VAR 1101(0001,0100)]s of Pokémon\nthat can be found around the land of Kitakami![VAR 0114(002A)]
I guess it’s still early days for your time\nhere in Kitakami, right?\c\nBe sure to meet tons and tons and TONS of\nPokémon that you can’t find back home![VAR 0114(002A)]
You know why you find different Pokémon in\ndifferent places around the world? Climate!\c\nThe humid summers here mean it’s home to\nlots of Pokémon that like things nice and damp![VAR 0114(002A)]
If you head high up on Oni Mountain, you’ll find\nvolcanic gas leaking out of the ground!\c\nSounds like a comfy place for Pokémon that are\ndrawn to that sort of thing, doesn’t it?[VAR 0114(002A)]
Though you should make sure not to inhale too\nmuch of that gas yourself, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(002A)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Wooow, [VAR 0100(0000)]! You’ve\nalmost\r\ncompleted\r\nthe\r\nKitakami\r\nPokédex!\c\nKeep on checking those Pokémon habitats in your\nPokédex and trying out raids in crystal caverns...\r\nand you’ll have it complete in no time![VAR 0114(002A)]
Wait, are you telling me...you’ve caught them all?![VAR 0114(002A)]
Wow! WOW! A complete Kitakami Pokédex!\nThis is great—no, YOU’RE great![VAR 0114(002A)]
Thanks to all your hard work, I don’t think there’s\nanything more to be done when it comes to\r\nsurveying the Pokémon that live here in Kitakami![VAR 0114(002A)]
I really wish I had something to give you to\ncommemorate all your effort...[VAR 0114(002A)]
Oh! I know![VAR 0114(002A)]
I’ll give you this charm I got at Kitakami Hall! It’s\na limited-edition souvenir they only sell there![VAR 0114(002A)]
Oh, and can you show me your Rotom Phone for\na second?[VAR 0114(002A)]
Thanks to the diploma feature Director Clavell\nhelped with, we can celebrate your achievement\r\nin style, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(002A)]
See? You can get a special message from the\ncompany that certifies Pokédex completion![VAR 0114(002A)]
You may have completed this Pokédex, but that\ndoesn’t mean your school trip has to end![VAR 0114(002A)]
I hope you’ll keep meeting lots and lots of new\nPokémon friends around Kitakami![VAR 0114(002A)]
The weather sure is nice... What a fresh start to a\nnew day![VAR 0114(002A)]
Kitakami summers sure are hot and muggy, aren’t\nthey? My lab coat is soaked through with sweat![VAR 0114(002A)]
Don’t you think the colors of the sunset seem\npaler here in Kitakami than in Paldea?\c\nMaybe the sunlight refracts differently? Whatever\nthe cause, it is very pretty![VAR 0114(002A)]
I see you’re working hard late into the night.\c\nBut make sure to take a look up at the sky\nonce in a while! There isn’t much light coming\r\nfrom town, so you can really see the stars.[VAR 0114(002A)]
Looks like we’re in for a wet one! Pokémon that\nlove rain must be going wild right now![VAR 0114(002A)]
The rain does nothing to cool down the\noppressive heat of the Kitakami summer!\r\nWhat a climate they have here!\c\nIt seems to exert quite the influence on the\necosystem as well.[VAR 0114(002A)]
Evening showers, huh? Take care—your body\ntemperature will drop if you don’t dry off![VAR 0114(002A)]
Visibility is poor at night, and the ground is all\nslippery from the rain. I wouldn’t want one of my\r\ndear students to go wandering off in the dark![VAR 0114(002A)]
Keep striving toward that goal of registering\n200 species in your Kitakami Pokédex!\c\nIf you manage to pull it off, open up your\nPokédex App and press the X Button to get it\r\ncertified. And then come show me, of course![VAR 0114(002A)]

Hey, you’re one of those students from Paldea!\c\nSee, I happen to make chairs in my free time...
but I’m a bit stuck on what design to use for\nsome nice picnic chairs.
Could you maybe show me any tablecloths\nyou’ve got on you?
Oh, maybe you aren’t all that interested in\npicnics...
You show the old man your tablecloth!

You put the ingredients in your Bag’s\n[VAR FF00(0008)]Picnic Items [VAR FF00(0000)]pocket.
Are you hungry? I can share with you, if you’d\nlike.
Eating a nice sandwich outdoors in Kitakami\nreally is something special.
How’re you feeling? You can take a rest, if you’d\nlike.
Are you worn out from your adventures?\nYou’d better take a breather before you go!
Three really does make company! Come by again\nwhenever you want!
I’ll be here for a while, so feel free to stop by if\nyou get tired.
Oho? Have you brought me yet another new\ntablecloth?
[VAR BD06(0000)]You show the old man your\n[VAR 0109(0001)]!
Oho... Well, I’ll be! So this design is from a place\ncalled Blueberry Academy, is it?
I’ll try making some new chairs based on this\ndesign!
And a one, and a two... Here I go!
The prototype is complete! I’ll give you these\nchairs as thanks for showing me that design.
I was able to make so many new chairs thanks\nto you! I can’t express my appreciation enough!

Hello, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0045)]
Good evening, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0045)]
We are very grateful for all you did to help clear\nup that horrible confusion over dear Ogerpon.[VAR 0114(0045)]
I never dreamt that the “Loyal Three” were in the\nwrong—and that poor Ogerpon was the victim![VAR 0114(0045)]
Why, we would have gone on passing down the\nwrong story without a second thought![VAR 0114(0045)]
All that being said![VAR 0114(0045)]
While I do fully understand that the Loyal Three\nwere villains...[VAR 0114(0045)]
You’ve seen the state of Loyalty Plaza, yes?\c\nThe statues are ruined—shattered to pieces when\nthose three were resurrected!\c\nDoesn’t it pain your heart to see it so?[VAR 0114(0045)]
And only too right! I knew a student of a fine\nacademy like yours must appreciate the\r\nsignificance of such a site![VAR 0114(0045)]
Oh? You DID see what that place looked like\nbefore the monument was destroyed, didn’t you?\c\nI’m sure you mourn for the loss of such a site,\neven if your words tell another story.[VAR 0114(0045)]
Yes, the actual “Loyal Three” were in the wrong.\nBut the monument brought so many touri—\c\nI mean, it brought so much comfort and hope to\nthe people of our village for generations.[VAR 0114(0045)]
Which is why...\c\nI have begun a fundraiser to restore that beloved\nsite to its former state—and I am calling it the\r\n[VAR FF00(0006)]“We Love Loyalty Plaza” drive[VAR FF00(0000)]![VAR 0114(0045)]
We are looking for donations of 10,000, with\nthe ultimate goal of gathering 1,000,000![VAR 0114(0045)]
Be that as it may, I couldn’t possibly take that\nkind of money from a student such as yourself...[VAR 0114(0045)]
But perhaps you could subtly nudge your parents\nor teachers to contribute to our cause![VAR 0114(0045)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]We’ve collected a total of [VAR 0206(0001,002C)] so far for\nthe\r\n[VAR FF00(0006)]“We Love Loyalty Plaza” drive[VAR FF00(0000)]![VAR 0114(0045)]
I’ll give [VAR BD03(0000)]10,000
I’ll give [VAR BD03(0000)]100,000
Maybe next time
You’d be so kind as to give 10,000 to our\nfundraiser?[VAR 0114(0045)]
Goodness me! You really wish to give us an\nentire 100,000 at once?![VAR 0114(0045)]
We’ll reach that 1,000,000 in due time—\nyou’ll see! And I’ll be here until we do![VAR 0114(0045)]
It seems you don’t have enough money to make\nthat sort of donation...[VAR 0114(0045)]
Well, I accept your kind support with gratitude!\nAnd here—a little something for you in return.[VAR 0114(0045)]
Our goal is to raise a total of 1,000,000, and\nwe’ve raised [VAR 0206(0001,002C)] so far![VAR 0114(0045)]
With that donation— O-oh my...[VAR 0114(0045)]
We’ve reached our goal of 1,000,000![VAR 0114(0045)]
Now we can at last restore Loyalty Plaza to the\nway it was![VAR 0114(0045)]
Let me call our contractor at once...\n*beep* *boop* *beep* *beep*[VAR 0114(0045)]
Hello? Yes, yes, it’s me again. We were able to\nraise the funds for the project!\c\nWe’d love to see work get started at once![VAR 0114(0045)]
They say they’re already done! Why don’t we\nhead over to see the fruits of your labor?[VAR 0114(0045)]
Ohhh... Would you just look—![VAR 0114(0045)]
Thanks to our “We Love Loyalty Plaza” drive,\nthe old monument has been reborn![VAR 0114(0045)]
Goodness, did they ever do a fine job! It’s hard\nto believe it’s not the exact same monument![VAR 0114(0045)]
We even re-created the scratches and blemishes\nit had before!
Hahaha! Now THAT is true craftsmanship and\ndedication for you![VAR 0114(0045)]
This is just what the village needed!\c\nYes, just what we needed...to draw in more\ntourists who’ll want to take photos here!\c\nWe’ll be topping the tourism charts in no time![VAR 0114(0045)]
Hurray! Hurray! Come on, all together now![VAR 0114(0045)]
You learned the [VAR FF00(0008)]Hurray! emote [VAR FF00(0000)]from the\ncaretaker!
[VAR BD06(0000)]I also have a special gift for you,\n[VAR 0100(0000)],\r\nfor\r\nbeing\r\nour\r\nnumber\r\none\r\nsupporter.[VAR 0114(0045)]
You obtained the[VAR FF00(0008)] Festival Jinbei (Flashy)[VAR FF00(0000)]!
We had a bit left over from the fundraiser, so\nI went ahead and glammed that up for you.[VAR 0114(0045)]
Wear it out and about to advertise the wonders\nof Kitakami to all your friends in Paldea![VAR 0114(0045)]
Hmm... Perhaps my next goal should be to open\nup a stylish café at Loyalty Plaza...[VAR 0114(0045)]

Hey, kid. Your Pokémon look strong.
Hey, kid. Your Pokémon look strong.
You just might have what it takes to challenge\nthe Kitakami Ogre Clan.
The Kitakami Ogre Clan?
Who in the world...?
There’s a group of strong Trainers in ogre masks\nwho’ve been popping up outside the village.\r\nThey call themselves the Kitakami Ogre Clan.
They’re always on the hunt for the next battle...\nand tough kids like you are their favorite foes.
Rumor has it the Kitakami Ogre Clan’s got seven\nmembers in all...
If you’re gonna battle them, watch yourself.\nThey may be trickier to beat than you’d think.\c\nI’ll give ya something cool for each member you\ndo manage to defeat, though.
Heard you beat a member of the Kitakami Ogre\nClan! Here’s your cool prize, as promised.
Heard you beat some members of the Kitakami\nOgre Clan! Here’re your cool prizes,\r\nas promised.
There’s just one member left... Want a hint for\nwhere they might be?
There are [VAR 0200(0001)] members of the Kitakami Ogre Clan\nleft... Want a hint for where one of ’em might be?
“Leave Oni Mountain and follow the blue. Find\nsome bamboo, and you’ll find me!”\c\nThat’s your only hint—now go find them!
“You will find me in a place where many gaze out\nupon the Oni’s horn.”\c\nThat’s your only hint—now go find them!
“You will find me in the ravine beside the water\nthat flows from the Oni’s mouth.”\c\nThat’s your only hint—now go find them!
“Trapped low down between the infernal and\na paradise, you will find me beside the water.”\c\nThat’s your only hint—now go find them!
“You will find me in a wasteland of peculiar rocks\nin a land with no suffering.”\c\nThat’s your only hint—now go find them!
“Upon the shorter of the Oni’s horns—that is\nwhere you will find me standing.”\c\nThat’s your only hint—now go find them!
“Descend a hole beside a pool that is never\ndark, and you will find me.”\c\nThat’s your only hint—now go find them!
And with that...it seems you’ve defeated every\nlast member of the Kitakami Ogre Clan.
With an opponent as strong as you, I think I can\nactually go all out...
Hah!
I am the one and only secret master of the\nKitakami Ogre Clan!
The final battle is nigh. Let me know once you’ve\nprepared yourself.
One last battle with me... I trust that your\npreparations are in place?
... ... ...\c\nThen return when you are ready.
Let’s go somewhere more suited for battle.\nCome with me.
I am Muramasa, secret master of the Kitakami\nOgre Clan! Now...have at you!
Hahaha! So you’ve managed to defeat even me!\nI must commend your strength!
... ... ...\n... ... ...
...Hah, just kidding! Thanks for taking part in\nour little event!
You see, the Kitakami Ogre Clan is actually a\nspecial campaign we run to train up the kiddos\r\nand let ’em experience the joys of battling.
We always hold this event around the same time\nas the Festival of Masks...
Problem is, our members don’t know how to hold\nback, so a kid’s never made it to the end before!
I think you might be the first one to defeat me!
So here, congrats! Take this prize!
Keep up your training in the land of Kitakami.\nGrow big and strong in the great outdoors!
Well, if it isn’t the first kid to defeat me! Come\nto pay me a visit? Haha, splendid! Just splendid!

We’re pretty much the most lovey-dovey couple\never, don’tcha think?
You bet! There’s probably not a pair on the\nplanet as perfect together as you and me.
Right?!
Hey, you!
We’re wondering if there are any Pokémon\nthat are lovey-dovey like the two of us.\r\nIf you manage to find any, bring ’em here!
Oh, I’m sure you’ll find one—when Lechonk fly!\nAhaha!
Did you find some lovey-dovey Pokémon that\nare always together?
See? There’s no way a Pokémon could out-lovey\nOR out-dovey us! Ahaha!
This Pokémon...\c\nNope—it’s not even dovey, let alone lovey!\nAhaha!
Wh-what’s this?! A Tandemaus?!\c\nThey’re lovey-dovey, they come in pairs, and\nthey’re always together?!
Wh-what’s this? A Maushold?!\c\nSo lovey-dovey that they ended up with a\nprecious little bundle of joy?!
Wh-what’s this? A Maushold?!\c\nSo lovey-dovey that they have two li’l ones?!\nA happy li’l family?!
So there ARE Pokémon out there that are head\nover heels for each other like we are!
Thank you for showing us that Pokémon! How\nabout we teach you a special pose in return?
You learned the [VAR FF00(0008)]Heart (Right) emote[VAR FF00(0000)] and the\n[VAR FF00(0008)]Heart (Left) emote [VAR FF00(0000)]from the lovey-dovey couple!
You should use that heart pose we taught you\ntogether with someone special!
Pokémon and humans... We both have so much\nlove to share, don’t we?

Congratulations on your victory over Amarys!
Now you can attempt Flying Time Trials as\nmany times as you like, even if you’re not\r\nchallenging the BB League!
Would you like to attempt a Flying Time Trial?
Which course would you like to attempt?
The easy course it is! I hope you have fun!
The normal course it is! Good luck out there!
The hard course it is! Better not blink!
The super-hard course it is! I hope you’re ready\nfor a challenge!
In this game, you’ll ride a flying Pokémon through\nan aerial course we’ve set up around the dome.
If you make it to the goal within the time limit,\nthen you pass.
You’ll earn a little extra time each time you fly\nthrough a Magnemite ring!
Keep trying to beat your own records!
Let’s have a look at your records...
You completed the easy course with a remaining\ntime of [VAR 0201(0001)]:[VAR 0201(0002)].[VAR 0201(0003)]!
As for the normal course, you had a remaining\ntime of [VAR 0201(0001)]:[VAR 0201(0002)].[VAR 0201(0003)]!
And for the hard course, your remaining time\nwas [VAR 0201(0001)]:[VAR 0201(0002)].[VAR 0201(0003)]!
It looks like you haven’t completed the easy\ncourse yet!
As for the normal course, you still need to clear\nthat one.
And for the hard course? Yeah, you’ll need to\ncomplete it before you can get a best time!
I’ll have a go!
Tell me how it works
What are my best times?
Never mind
The easy course
The normal course
The hard course
The super-hard course
This is the first time you’ve completed the easy\ncourse with me! You’ve earned yourself some BP!
You’re now able to attempt the normal course!\nIt’s a bit more difficult, so be ready!
This is the first time you’ve completed the normal\ncourse! You’ve earned yourself some BP!
You’re now able to attempt the hard course!\nI daresay it will be a bit more of a challenge.
That was amazing! Congratulations! This is your\nfirst time completing the hard course! You’ve\r\nearned yourself some BP!
Oh, I see you’ve beaten your personal record!\nYou’ve earned yourself some BP!
Congratulations on finishing the course!\nYou’ve earned yourself some BP!
Too bad you didn’t manage to finish this time...\nI hope you come by again for another go!
Oh, it looks like your Pokémon isn’t ready to be\nridden! Please make sure you’re able to ride your\r\nPokémon when attempting a Flying Time Trial!
Now, for the SUPER-hard course, your remaining\ntime was...[VAR 0201(0001)]:[VAR 0201(0002)].[VAR 0201(0003)]!
Finally, there’s the super-hard course... Looks like\nthat one’s still waiting for you to complete it!
Unbelievable performance! You completed the\nsuper-hard course for the first time!\c\nMy heartfelt congratulations to you, and here’s a\nheaping load of BP to celebrate!
You received [VAR 0204(0001,002C)] BP from the receptionist!

I must thank thee for thine aid during our recent\nstudy session. ’Twas truly of great assistance.[VAR 0114(0023)]
What’re you up to?
“Special garments,” huh?
Ah, I see I have piqued thine interest! ’Tis clear\nthou hast a keen eye for quality.[VAR 0114(0023)]

I labored long into the night fashioning this\ncreation—[VAR 1300(0001,0000)][VAR 01C1(0001)].\c\nI ask for [VAR 0205(0003,002C)] as the starting price. Now,\nbegin thy bidding, noble clientele! Have at ye![VAR 0114(0023)]
The highest bid rests at [VAR 0205(0003,002C)]! Pray tell, who\namongst you hath the spirit to bid again?![VAR 0114(0023)]

Ah, stay thy horses... It would seem thou hast\ninsufficient funds.\c\nPray return after padding thy coin purse some![VAR 0114(0023)]

As thanks, allow me to teach thee a pose that is\nessential for a connoisseur of the fine arts![VAR 0114(0023)]
You learned the [VAR FF00(0008)]Glow Stick Dance emote[VAR FF00(0000)] from\nAtticus![VAR 0114(0023)]

Eri here! But I’m sure that was obvious.[VAR 0114(0022)]

Figured it was about time we started clawin’ back\nall that learnin’ we missed out on while we were\r\nholed up in our bases.[VAR 0114(0021)]
Our Team Star outfits aren’t all that practical\nfor tests and things, so we came in our new\r\nschool uniforms today.[VAR 0114(0022)]

We’ve got a little proposal for ya...[VAR 0114(0021)]
How’d you like to be a tutor?![VAR 0114(0021)]
Geez, one step at a time! Maybe we should start\nby explaining what’s going on?[VAR 0114(0022)]
Whoops. Right you are, Eri.[VAR 0114(0021)]
So, ah, OK. Basically, the other Team Star bosses\nare havin’ a rough time of it...[VAR 0114(0021)]
You remember Mellie, Ortie, and Atticus, right?[VAR 0114(0022)]
Those three, yup. They’ve been takin’ makeup\ntests like us, but they sure ain’t passing ’em...[VAR 0114(0021)]
They might actually have to repeat the year,\nwhich would suck after all the effort they put in\r\nto come back to school.[VAR 0114(0021)]
Before you ask—me an’ Eri have already tried\ntutoring them ourselves...[VAR 0114(0021)]
But it didn’t go well. At all.[VAR 0114(0022)]
Nope. You know, I seriously didn’t think those\nthree’d have such a hard time.\c\nI mean, for me, it feels like all you need to do to\npass tests is learn formulas and memorize stuff.[VAR 0114(0021)]
Guess I just can’t wrap my head around what it is\nthey can’t wrap their heads around...[VAR 0114(0021)]
And I’m only good at teaching people if it’s to\ndo with sports or exercise...[VAR 0114(0022)]
We heard from Penny that your grades are\npretty decent.[VAR 0114(0021)]
I bet even Ortega and the others would perk\ntheir ears up if you dropped by to teach ’em![VAR 0114(0021)]
Which loops us right back to my opening refrain.\nThink you could help tutor for us?[VAR 0114(0021)]
Yeah, I’d be happy to help!

We’ve stressed her out enough for one lifetime—\nthere’s no way we can bother her with this![VAR 0114(0021)]
This’ll be our little secret, OK?[VAR 0114(0022)]
We’ll be right here, so come let us know when\nyou’re ready to start![VAR 0114(0022)]

You all set to tutor the other Team Star bosses\nup to test-bossin’ level?[VAR 0114(0021)]
Hey, don’t sweat it—we’re not goin’ anywhere.\nCome on back whenever you’re ready.[VAR 0114(0021)]
Music to my ears! Let’s go lay down a killer\nstudy sesh![VAR 0114(0021)]
Are you free right now to help us with some\ntutoring, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0022)]
No problem! We’re fine hanging out here for as\nlong as it takes![VAR 0114(0022)]
Fantastic! Come on, then—we’ll show you to the\nclassroom.[VAR 0114(0022)]
’Sup, gang! Studying hard, I hope?[VAR 0114(0021)]
Well, we WERE before you and your big mouth\nshowed up!\c\nHere to check we’re not slacking off, are you?[VAR 0114(0020)]
Pretty much. Your eyes start glazing over the\nsecond I’m out the door. Tell me I’m wrong.[VAR 0114(0021)]
Ah, Lady Eri clad in her academy uniform...[VAR 0114(0023)]
I feel mine eyes sharpen and my mind focus\neach time this vision returns to greet me.[VAR 0114(0023)]
If only that focus were helpful for your studies,\nAtticus... Sorry I keep distracting you.[VAR 0114(0022)]
Oho? What’s this?! My ninja senses detect the\npresence of another behind thee, Lady Eri![VAR 0114(0023)]
Come!!! Step forward, knave, that we might see\nthy face![VAR 0114(0023)]
It’s me—[VAR 0100(0000)]!
It’s your tutor!
YOU?! What the—? Noooooo no no no, why is\nthis happening?![VAR 0114(0020)]
Ah. I should have surmis’d as much. The strength\nof thy spirit precedes thee as ever, good [VAR 1100(00FF,0406)]fellowlady.[VAR 0114(0023)]
Never mind that! Giacomo! EXPLAIN! What’s\n[VAR 0100(0000)] doing here?![VAR 0114(0020)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Hey now, be nice! [VAR 0100(0000)]...\nWait,\r\nno,\r\nProfessor\r\n[VAR 0100(0000)]\r\nis\r\ngonna\r\nbe\r\nyour tutor![VAR 0114(0021)]
O, glad tidings! I am truly grateful to hear it.[VAR 0114(0023)]
[VAR 1100(00FF,0201)]HShe’s gonna be WHAT?! Since when?![VAR 0114(0020)]
You can’t just go stomping around deciding stuff\nlike this without asking anyone, Giacomo![VAR 0114(0020)]
And YOU! We don’t need a tutor! Do us a favor\nand toddle on home, would you?[VAR 0114(0020)]
...Hey, Ortie?[VAR 0114(0022)]
[VAR BD06(0000)][VAR 0100(0000)] kindly agreed to\ncome\r\nhere\r\nand\r\nhelp\r\nus out.[VAR 0114(0022)]
So talking to h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]imer with that kind of attitude...[VAR 0114(0022)]
I S   U N A C C E P T A B L E . . . R I G H T ?[VAR 0114(0022)]
Gah... Y-yeah, no, totally, I... Sorry, Eri.[VAR 0114(0020)]
S O R R Y ,   * W H O * ?[VAR 0114(0022)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Oh... Um, what I meant was: sorry,\n[VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0020)]
Ah, Lady Eri in a menacing mood... What a vision\nof unusual rarity![VAR 0114(0023)]
Hey, don’t worry about Ortega—he just doesn’t\nwant you to see him flounderin’.[VAR 0114(0021)]
Hey guys? We seem to have lost Mellie...\nWhere’d she go?[VAR 0114(0022)]
Lady Mela declared her wish to stretch her legs\nminutes afore your arrival.\c\nShe departed rather suddenly and has not\nreturn’d since.[VAR 0114(0023)]
Well, we all know Mela. She just wandered off\n’cause she doesn’t feel like studying.[VAR 0114(0020)]
I hate to say it, but I guess that’s probably true...[VAR 0114(0022)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Sorry about this, [VAR 0100(0000)], but\nyou\r\nthink\r\nyou\r\ncould\r\ngo\r\nfind Mela for us?\c\nShe’ll be somewhere in the academy for sure![VAR 0114(0021)]
We’ll stay on standby here and get everythin’\nprepped for our killer study sesh.[VAR 0114(0021)]
Sorry to keep relying on you like this. I hope you\nfind Mellie without much trouble![VAR 0114(0022)]
Now, what music is best for hittin’ the books...?\c\nRyme’s beats slap, but I guess they’re kinda\noverkill for studyin’...[VAR 0114(0021)]
Mellie’s been pouring so much into her studies\nrecently... Maybe she just needed some exercise?[VAR 0114(0022)]
If you signed yourself up to tutor us, you must be\npretty confident in your book smarts, huh?\c\nTch. Why does a jerk like you get all the talent?\nYou. Are. The. WORST.[VAR 0114(0020)]
Verily, scholarship is a labyrinth. Thy guidance\nand encouragement will be most welcome.[VAR 0114(0023)]

... ... ...[VAR 0114(002C)]
Huh? Oh...hey, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(002C)]
Mela? Is that you?!
Um, have we met?!
Seriously? You have eyes, don’t you? Obviously\nit’s Mela you’re talkin’ to![VAR 0114(001F)]
Oh, right. I guess I’m not decked out in my usual\ngear today.[VAR 0114(001F)]
Eri made a big fuss about wearin’ our uniforms\nfor this study-group thing.\c\nSo yeah, it’s not like I had much of a choice.[VAR 0114(001F)]
But what’re you doin’ here anyway?[VAR 0114(001F)]
I’ve been looking for you
I came to raid your base
Wow, what’s the occasion? You itchin’ for another\nshowdown or somethin’?[VAR 0114(001F)]
A raid? Sorry, pal. I’m not in the mood for a\nnostalgia trip right now.[VAR 0114(001F)]
...Oh. OK. You came up here to bring me back to\nthe classroom, huh?[VAR 0114(001F)]
Guess time got away from me while I was\nadmirin’ the veggies.[VAR 0114(001F)]
Might as well get goin’, then.[VAR 0114(001F)]
’Sup, amigos![VAR 0114(001F)]
Mellie! Welcome back![VAR 0114(0022)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]And [VAR 0100(0000)]—thanks so much\nfor\r\nfinding\r\nher.[VAR 0114(0022)]
So? Where were you lazing around this time?[VAR 0114(0020)]
Eh, you know... Here ’n’ there.[VAR 0114(001F)]
Lady Mela? Is something amiss?[VAR 0114(0023)]
Nahhh, we’re all good, right? The dream study\nteam’s all here—that’s what counts![VAR 0114(0021)]
Time’s a-wastin’, so I say let’s hit the books![VAR 0114(0021)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Take it away, Professor\n[VAR 0100(0000)]!\r\nThese\r\nthree\r\nare\r\ncountin’\r\non ya![VAR 0114(0021)]
Leave the music to me! I’ll keep a steady stream\nof lo-fi chill beats playin’ for ya.[VAR 0114(0021)]
I hope everyone tries their best![VAR 0114(0022)]
Guh, how am I supposed to know this? I don’t\nget it...[VAR 0114(0020)]
See how it’s going
Back off for now
Don’t think I didn’t see you and your smug face\nhovering there. You’ve got some nerve.[VAR 0114(0020)]
You realize I’m a second-year student, right?\nI’m an entire year ABOVE you.[VAR 0114(0020)]
...Hmph. Eri says we need to let you help, so fine!\nYou can try to tutor me or whatever.\c\nBut I’ll be shocked if you can get this literature\nstuff to sink in.[VAR 0114(0020)]
I mean, how am I supposed to know how some\nmade-up characters in a story are feeling?![VAR 0114(0020)]
See, the protagonist in this book is the mom in a\nMaushold family—her name’s Mama Maushold.\c\nWe’re supposed to analyze why she calls Papa\nMaushold “terrible” in this passage.[VAR 0114(0020)]
Mama Maushold’s eyes glittered with tears.\nIt was clear from the letter Papa Maushold\nhad left: she would never get to see him again.\n“Toying with my feelings right to the end...\nYou really are a [VAR FF00(0006)]terrible [VAR FF00(0000)]thing.”
She must truly think he’s terrible
She must actually love him a lot
We can’t know what’s in her heart
Huh. Maybe you’re not half bad at tutoring after\nall! The answer was staring me right in the face!\r\nWhy did I even bother overthinking this?[VAR 0114(0020)]
OK, no, hold up! Why would they ask you to\nanalyze this if the answer’s written right there?\c\nI just...feel like that’s not the right call...[VAR 0114(0021)]
Hey, Giacomo’s calling you out! Are you sure\nyou really know your stuff?![VAR 0114(0020)]
I’m starting to think you’re as bad as I am at\nunderstanding how people feel...[VAR 0114(0020)]
You know what? I’ve seen all I needed to see.\c\nI think I’ll be better off studying by myself, so\nfeel free to toddle on home, “Professor.”[VAR 0114(0020)]
HUH?! So she calls him terrible, but she actually\nloves him? Why doesn’t she just say that, then?\r\nThere’s no way that’s the right answer![VAR 0114(0020)]
You sure about that, my man? I’d have thought\nyou of all people would relate![VAR 0114(0021)]
What’s that supposed to mean?[VAR 0114(0020)]
Only that you do exactly the same thing with\n[VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nYou’re always snappin’ at h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]imer and bein’ difficult,\nbut you actually respect h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]imer a ton, don’tcha?[VAR 0114(0021)]
WHAT?! You must be JOKING! There’s no\nuniverse in which I respect this oaf even a little!\r\nNuh-uh, no way, NOPE![VAR 0114(0020)]
... ... ...[VAR 0114(0020)]
Fine, OK. I guess people are tempted to say\nthe opposite of what they mean sometimes.[VAR 0114(0020)]
Hmph. This question makes more sense to me\nnow. But just a tiny bit!\c\nThanks for not being entirely useless.[VAR 0114(0020)]
Huh. Didn’t expect such an astute answer from\nthe likes of you!\c\nIt’s so true that we just don’t know what goes on\nin other people’s heads. That’s gotta be it.[VAR 0114(0020)]
OK, no. Hold up! There’s no way the correct\nanswer is somethin’ as lazy as that.\c\nI just...feel like you should rethink this one...[VAR 0114(0021)]
Hey, Giacomo’s calling you out! Are you sure\nyou really know your stuff?![VAR 0114(0020)]
I’m starting to think you’re as bad as I am at\nunderstanding how people feel...[VAR 0114(0020)]
You know what? I’ve seen all I needed to see.\c\nI think I’ll be better off studying by myself, so\nfeel free to toddle on home, “Professor.”[VAR 0114(0020)]
Okaaay, moving on to the next one...\c\n“A tale of three Spidops whose brotherly bonds\nare even more tangled than the webs they\r\nweave.” Huh?! ANOTHER family sob story?[VAR 0114(0020)]
What I know...is that I know naught. I have\nfathom’d the depths of mine own ignorance...[VAR 0114(0023)]
Ah, noble sensei. Comest thou to proffer me a\nhelping hand?[VAR 0114(0023)]
My deepest thanks...[VAR 0114(0023)]
Mathematics is the scourge of my existence—in\nparticular, arithmetic! ’Tis an unsolvable mystery.[VAR 0114(0023)]
But since my true calling lies in garment design,\nI feel I need not concern myself with numbers.\r\nThey have naught to do with fashion, after all![VAR 0114(0023)]
Yeah, I guess they don’t
No, you’ll need numbers
Aha! So our views are in alignment.[VAR 0114(0023)]
Then I shan’t waste a moment more on arithmetic.\nThe ninja arts are where my focus should lie![VAR 0114(0023)]
That’s right!
Hold on a sec
Hrmmm... Skill in mathematics will still be of\nservice to me, you say? I do not quite follow...[VAR 0114(0023)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]I think I know what [VAR 0100(0000)] is\ngetting at.[VAR 0114(0022)]
It’s like with our Team Star outfits, remember?\nWe ended up spending a lot of money on them.[VAR 0114(0022)]
As indeed we should! One must not shy from\nexpense when creating objects of great quality.[VAR 0114(0023)]
But we had reams of fabric left over after the\noutfits were made.\c\nDon’t you think we could have saved more\nmoney there?[VAR 0114(0022)]
I...I cannot deny it. ’Tis a fair point.[VAR 0114(0023)]
Now that I think of it, the garments’ dimensions\nand the cost of materials demand calculation.\c\nAnd if selling one’s creations, profit margins, too,\ncome into play...[VAR 0114(0023)]
A designer who pays heed to such figures and\nsums would surely prove the superior artisan![VAR 0114(0023)]
’Twould seem my thinking was naive... I had\nturn’d mine eyes from the inconvenient truth.[VAR 0114(0023)]
Splendid! I shall fetch my shuriken forthwith and\nretire outdoors for target practice![VAR 0114(0023)]
Don’t even think about it, Atticus! You can’t just\nabandon an entire subject![VAR 0114(0022)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]B-but Lady Eri! [VAR 0100(0000)] hath\nalready\r\napprov’d\r\nmy\r\ntraining\r\nin\r\nthe\r\nninja arts...[VAR 0114(0023)]
Hey, [VAR 0100(0000)]...\c\nI don’t mean to criticize, but could you try not to\nencourage these three to neglect their studies?\r\nIt’s really not in their best interest...[VAR 0114(0022)]
O, Lady Eri, the melancholy upon thy face cuts\nme to the core. Perhaps I judg’d poorly...[VAR 0114(0023)]
Very well. I will return to the joyless embrace of\narithmetic, no matter my wishes to the contrary...[VAR 0114(0023)]
Hrm? Thou meanst to say my desir’d course of\naction would be one step too far?[VAR 0114(0023)]
Curse thee, arithmetic—my foul nemesis. Yet\nagain you thwart my pursuit of joy...[VAR 0114(0023)]
Atticus! You’re making this into a bigger issue\nthan it needs to be.[VAR 0114(0022)]
We all have things we’re bad at, and life will\nalways throw challenges our way.[VAR 0114(0022)]
But, uh...that doesn’t mean we should just quit!\c\nFor me, there’s nothing more inspiring than\nsomeone who tackles their problems head-on\r\nand finds a way through![VAR 0114(0022)]
Lady Eri...[VAR 0114(0023)]
That decides it! My heart is changed and my\nmind made up. From now on...[VAR 0114(0023)]
I will devote myself to the study of mathematics!\nHI-YAAAAAAAAAH!!![VAR 0114(0023)]
Curse thee, fractional division... Why must I\ninvert the numerator and denominator? Why?![VAR 0114(0023)]
Sorry I kinda butted in on your tutoring just now,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nI’m glad it all worked out though. Thanks to you,\nAtticus seems really inspired to study![VAR 0114(0022)]
He’s the type that gets totally absorbed once\nhe’s fired up, so I’m sure he’ll be just fine![VAR 0114(0022)]
Well, it looks like Atticus is a bit more motivated\nto study than before...[VAR 0114(0022)]
But he seems so sad, it doesn’t exactly fill me\nwith confidence that he’ll do well on his tests.\r\nThat’s a real shame...[VAR 0114(0022)]
... ... ...\n... ... ...[VAR 0114(001F)]
Man, this is hard...[VAR 0114(001F)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Huh? What’re you lookin’ at,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]?\c\n...Oh yeah. You’re our tutor now, aren’tcha?[VAR 0114(001F)]
All right, then. I was just doin’ some practice\nquestions.\c\nHere, lemme know if you think this one’s true\nor false.[VAR 0114(001F)]
“You can get new Pokémon only by catching\nthem yourself or trading with other Trainers.”[VAR 0114(001F)]
That’s true
That’s false
Huh?! Did you forget about Eggs? That’s another\nway you can get new Pokémon, ain’t it?\c\nTch. Don’t go counting out Eggs before they’ve\neven hatched. That’s just rude.[VAR 0114(001F)]
Yeah, that’s what I thought, too. Can’t go\nforgettin’ about Pokémon you hatch from Eggs.[VAR 0114(001F)]
... ... ...\n... ... OK, next one.[VAR 0114(001F)]
“What is the name of the gemstone that glows\nover a Pokémon’s head when it Terastallizes?”[VAR 0114(001F)]
Tera Jewel
Tera Rock
Tera Stone
Yeah, that sounds about right!\c\nGuess it makes sense you know about all this,\nseein’ as you have your own Tera Orb.[VAR 0114(001F)]
Tera Rock? You sure about that? I don’t recall\nthat thing havin’ such a stupid-soundin’ name...\r\nNope, not ringin’ any bells.[VAR 0114(001F)]
Tera Stone? That sounds like it could be it...\nBut nah, it’s not actually ringin’ any bells.[VAR 0114(001F)]
Either way, Terastallizing is pretty awesome,\ndon’tcha think?\c\nOnly “outstanding” students get to have a\nTera Orb all for themselves, though...[VAR 0114(001F)]
... ... ...\n... ... OK, next one.[VAR 0114(001F)]
This has zilch to do with tests, but, uh...I wanna\nask you somethin’.[VAR 0114(001F)]
I dunno how to put it though... It’s a tricky one.\nYou gotta promise not to laugh, OK?[VAR 0114(001F)]
So, uh... How important do you think dreams are?[VAR 0114(001F)]
Like, when we sleep?
Like, our future goals?
HAHAHAHAHAHA!!!
No! Obviously not that kinda dream! I’m talkin’\nabout goals! What we wanna do with our lives![VAR 0114(001F)]
Exactly! I’m talkin’ about the future! What we\nwanna be when we’re older—that kinda stuff![VAR 0114(001F)]
HEY! I told you not to laugh!!!\c\nHope it was worth it, ’cause that’s the last time\nI ever ask you about anythin’![VAR 0114(001F)]
I’ve got no idea about all that right now...[VAR 0114(001F)]
Meanwhile, most of Team Star seem like they’ve\ngot it figured out. They’ve got proper dreams.[VAR 0114(001F)]
Even the veggies in the schoolyard are doin’\ntheir best to grow, y’know?\c\nI wish I had their kinda direction...[VAR 0114(001F)]
I mean, what’ll happen if I never figure it out?\nWhat if I never find a dream to chase?\r\nHonestly, I get scared just thinkin’ about it.[VAR 0114(001F)]
You’ll find a dream someday!
You have your art, don’t you?
You’re a hopeless optimist, you know that?[VAR 0114(001F)]
But I guess...yeah. Panicking about it won’t help.\nThanks for the valuable lesson, teach.[VAR 0114(001F)]
Huh? How’d you know I joined the art club?[VAR 0114(001F)]
Well, whatever, that’s just a hobby anyway.\nNot like I’m gonna do art to earn a livin’...[VAR 0114(001F)]
Wait. Now I think about it, Mr. Dragonbrows\ndoes art for HIS job.[VAR 0114(001F)]
He always looks like he’s havin’ a great time at\nschool—it’s like he’s not workin’ at all![VAR 0114(001F)]
If I could do somethin’ like that... If I could paint\nfor a livin’...that’d be crazy fun![VAR 0114(001F)]
Do you think that could be it? Is it really OK to\ncall that my dream?[VAR 0114(001F)]
For sure!
Not really
Oh, come on! You’re supposed to say “for sure”\nto a question like that![VAR 0114(001F)]
You’re right—that’s gotta be it! That’s my dream![VAR 0114(001F)]
Man...I feel like a whole new person! Thanks,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(001F)]
Tch. I’ve heard enough. Lemme get back to\nstudyin’ already, would ya?[VAR 0114(001F)]
I didn’t bust my butt comin’ back to school just\nto get kicked out.[VAR 0114(001F)]
You continued to tutor Team Star for a while...
All right, gang, I’d say it’s about time we cue the\noutro and wrap up today’s study sesh![VAR 0114(0021)]
Yes, great effort all around! Does everyone feel\nlike they made progress today?[VAR 0114(0022)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Totally! I sped through my practice questions\nlike a CHAMP!\c\nI guess [VAR 0100(0000)] wasn’t the\nworld’s\r\nworst\r\ntutor.[VAR 0114(0020)]
I guess I did OK. Sure feels like we didn’t need\na tutor, though.[VAR 0114(0020)]
Well, I learn’d that even arithmetic can be\nenthralling when engaged with in earnest!\c\nThanks to our esteem’d tutor, I feel enliven’d\nas a Revavroom drench’d in poison![VAR 0114(0023)]
Were a thousand lifetimes to pass afore I next\nencounter arithmetic, ’twould still be too soon...[VAR 0114(0023)]
I feel like someone’s used Defog on me, man.\c\nI’m seein’ everythin’ so clearly, the knowledge\nis just pourin’ itself into my brain![VAR 0114(001F)]
I dunno... I managed to cram the makeup test\ntopics into my brain, but that’s about it.[VAR 0114(001F)]
Oh, that’s brilliant, everyone! Well done! It\nsounds like this was our best session yet![VAR 0114(0022)]
It must’ve been thanks to your expert tutoring![VAR 0114(0022)]
Hm, it looks like we had some mixed results. But\nwe should be OK for the makeup tests, at least![VAR 0114(0022)]
So no one made much headway, huh? Oh dear...\nThat doesn’t bode well for your tests...[VAR 0114(0022)]
[VAR BD06(0000)][VAR 0100(0000)], it really was\nkind\r\nof\r\nyou\r\nto\r\nhelp\r\nus out.[VAR 0114(0022)]
We prepared a little thank-you gift from all of\nus, so here you go![VAR 0114(0022)]
You also obtained the [VAR FF00(0008)]Modified Uniform A[VAR FF00(0000)],\n[VAR FF00(0008)]Modified Uniform B[VAR FF00(0000)], [VAR FF00(0008)]Team Star Sunglasses[VAR FF00(0000)],\r\n[VAR FF00(0008)]Team Star Gloves[VAR FF00(0000)], [VAR FF00(0008)]Team Star Heels[VAR FF00(0000)], [VAR FF00(0008)]Team Star[VAR FF00(0000)]\r\n[VAR FF00(0008)]Helmet[VAR FF00(0000)], and [VAR FF00(0008)]Team Star Case[VAR FF00(0000)]!
And let’s do Team Star’s pose together, too!\nHere, I’ll teach you how to do it.[VAR 0114(0022)]
You learned the [VAR FF00(0008)]Hasta la Vistar ☆ emote[VAR FF00(0000)] from Eri!
Wha—? Guys! What are you all doing here?[VAR 0114(0008)]
Penny?![VAR 0114(0021)]
Yeesh. Busted.[VAR 0114(0020)]
Um... I was just walking down the hall and saw\nyou all in here...[VAR 0114(0008)]
B-but that’s fine! No one asked me to join, so I\nshould just leave, shouldn’t I?[VAR 0114(0008)]
S-sorry about that. See you later![VAR 0114(0008)]
Lady Penny, wait![VAR 0114(0023)]
It’s not what you think, Penny! Hear us out![VAR 0114(0022)]
So what happened was...[VAR 0114(0021)]
Phew... I thought you’d all decided not to talk to\nme anymore.[VAR 0114(0008)]
We would never![VAR 0114(0022)]
That’s what it must’ve looked like though, huh.\nSorry we made you worry.[VAR 0114(0022)]
We just didn’t wanna drag you into another one\nof our messes... Our bad, Penny.[VAR 0114(001F)]
Well, apology NOT accepted![VAR 0114(0008)]
...Wait, for real?[VAR 0114(0020)]
Why do YOU guys get to decide that I’d just be\nweighed down by your problems?![VAR 0114(0008)]
I...I’m your friend, right?[VAR 0114(0008)]
So...you should come bother me more. Lean on\nme! That’s what’d actually make me happy...[VAR 0114(0008)]
O, Lady Penny...[VAR 0114(0023)]
A-and if things get really bad, I can just hack into\nthe school system and fix your grades anyway![VAR 0114(0008)]
What?! That’s a terrible idea![VAR 0114(0022)]
Yeah, isn’t that takin’ it a bit far?[VAR 0114(0021)]
Ah... Sorry. That was a joke![VAR 0114(0008)]
I was trying to lighten things up in here, but I\nguess that was pretty out of character...[VAR 0114(0008)]
Glad to hear it! If you were serious, I would’ve\nhad to pummel some sense into ya![VAR 0114(001F)]
B-but about before! I’m actually a pretty good\ntutor, you know.[VAR 0114(0008)]
So feel free to ask me for help with studying\nand stuff anytime![VAR 0114(0008)]
Lady Penny, we are honor’d by thy generosity.[VAR 0114(0023)]
Ugh! Does that mean we gotta get lectured by\n[VAR 0100(0000)] AND Penny now?[VAR 0114(0020)]
Well...I guess there are worse things.[VAR 0114(0020)]
Haha! Careful, my man—that was dangerously\nclose to a straight-up compliment![VAR 0114(0021)]
You can just come right out and say you like the\nidea. We all know you’re thinkin’ it![VAR 0114(0021)]
Indeed! I need not even use my ninja senses,\nso childishly apparent are thy true feelings![VAR 0114(0023)]
WHAT?! As if you know what’s in my head![VAR 0114(0020)]
You guys haven’t got the first clue about me![VAR 0114(0020)]
Try getting to know me better before spouting\nnonsense, huh?! You’re! All! The! WORST!!![VAR 0114(0020)]
Pff. H-hey guys? I...I think we broke Ortega![VAR 0114(001F)]
Ahahahahahahahahaha!

[VAR BD06(0000)]Oh, hey there, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nWhat\r\nbrings\r\nyou\r\nback\r\nup here?[VAR 0114(004B)]
I just wanted to chat!
I could ask you the same
To chat? With me? Well, well—aren’t I the\npopular one![VAR 0114(004B)]
Me? Oh, I’m just enjoying the ocean breeze,\nstaring at the battle court, hoping for an\r\ninteresting match to start up or something.[VAR 0114(004B)]
By the by, how’s that Blueberry Pokédex of yours\ncoming along?[VAR 0114(004B)]
Come show me once you’ve filled it in a bit![VAR 0114(004B)]
And definitely come show me if you complete it!\nI’ll be sure to shower you with praise![VAR 0114(004B)]
Hey there, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(004B)]
It looks like you’ve caught...[VAR 0202(0001)] species of\nPokémon in the Terarium![VAR 0114(004B)]
Just getting started, huh?\c\nWell, don’t get discouraged! You only just arrived\nhere, after all.[VAR 0114(004B)]
You’re starting to make some headway, I see.\c\nDon’t be afraid to explore all the Terarium’s\nbiomes! Each one is unique from the others![VAR 0114(004B)]
That’s a pretty good collection you’ve got going!\c\nLots of different Pokémon in the Terarium, right?\nIt takes serious cash to keep the temperatures\r\nregulated throughout that whole thing![VAR 0114(004B)]
Wow, you’ve really got a knack for this!\c\nSince you’ve come this far already, you might as\nwell go all the way and complete the ’Dex![VAR 0114(004B)]
Hold on—does that mean you’ve filled in the\nentire thing?![VAR 0114(004B)]
Yes! Yes, it does! You’ve completed the Blueberry\nPokédex! Congratulations![VAR 0114(004B)]
We should have all the data we need on the\nPokémon living in the dome now, thanks to you![VAR 0114(004B)]
This is really impressive, you know. Not a single\nBlueberry Academy student has managed it yet![VAR 0114(004B)]
Here, you deserve a special something to\ncelebrate. I’m pretty sure this counts as special...[VAR 0114(004B)]
Why, hello, Director Cyrano. And hello to you\ntoo, M[VAR 1100(00FF,0305)]asteriss [VAR 0100(0000)].\c\nYour studies are going well, I hope?[VAR 0114(000A)]
Welcome, Velly! You’re not going to believe what\n[VAR 0100(0000)] just accomplished![VAR 0114(004B)]
Upon my word![VAR 0114(000A)]
It seems you’re making quite the splash here at\nBlueberry Academy, as you have elsewhere.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Heh heh heh... I knew I’d picked the right student\nfor this program.[VAR 0114(004B)]
While Director Cyrano is giving himself a hearty\npat on the back, allow me to reward you with a\r\nsmall gift.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Students who achieve great feats such as this\ndeserve to be recognized for their hard work.\c\nThis congratulatory message, penned by the\ncompany that certifies Pokédex completion,\r\nis for you.[VAR 0114(000A)]
I reconfigured your Pokédex app so that you may\nview your diploma there anytime you like.[VAR 0114(000A)]
You haven’t changed, have you, Velly? You’ve\nalways been good at this sort of thing.[VAR 0114(004B)]
Oh no, this really is nothing...[VAR 0114(000A)]
Also, Director, once again I must insist that you\naddress me properly in front of our studen—[VAR 0114(000A)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]I’m just glad your Treasure Hunt at my academy\nhas been such a success,\r\n[VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(004B)]
I hope you keep spending some quality time with\nall the Pokémon in the Terarium![VAR 0114(004B)]
Er, Director Cyrano? I do appreciate your kind\nwords, and I hate to interrupt...[VAR 0114(000A)]
But I would like you to confirm that you will no\nlonger refer to me as “Velly” in front...of...[VAR 0114(000A)]
...Director Cyrano? Are you even listening to me?[VAR 0114(000A)]
Good morning there! You’re certainly an early\nriser!\c\nMe, I just don’t sleep all that long anymore. It’s\nsomething that happens as you get older.[VAR 0114(004B)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Hello there, [VAR 0100(0000)]! I hope\nyou’re\r\nenjoying\r\nyour\r\ntime\r\nat\r\nBlueberry\r\nAcademy.\c\nYou’re free to do as you please, really—catch\nlots of Pokémon, do a bunch of BBQs...whatever![VAR 0114(004B)]
This really is the best place to enjoy a view of the\nsunset, don’t you think?\c\nWhy, it was worth building a school smack in the\nmiddle of the ocean just for this view![VAR 0114(004B)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Good evening, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nYou’re\r\nfull\r\nof\r\nenergy\r\neven\r\nat\r\nthis\r\nhour, eh?\c\nI think I’ll call it a day soon, though. Old guys like\nme need to go to bed early![VAR 0114(004B)]
Wonderful morning, isn’t it? If you like the rain,\nthat is!\c\nOf course, here at Blueberry Academy, it doesn’t\nmatter if you get wet—people will just think you\r\ngot a splash of ocean spray![VAR 0114(004B)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Howdy, [VAR 0100(0000)]! The rain just\nkeeps\r\ncoming\r\ndown,\r\ndoesn’t\r\nit?\c\nWe could have put a roof over the entrance area,\nbut I decided against it. So many Pokémon like\r\nthe rain, after all![VAR 0114(004B)]
We won’t be getting a view of the sunset tonight.\nThat’s too bad!\c\nI guess I’ll just go enjoy the artificial sunset in the\nTerarium![VAR 0114(004B)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Good evening there, [VAR 0100(0000)].\nI\r\nsee\r\nit\r\ntakes\r\nmore\r\nthan\r\njust\r\nrain\r\nto\r\nstop\r\nyou!\c\nJust be careful—the floors can get slippery. Don’t\nlose your footing and slip into the ocean![VAR 0114(004B)]
If you’ve completed the Blueberry Pokédex,\npress the [VAR FF00(0006)]X Button[VAR FF00(0000)] in the Pokédex app to\r\nmark it as done, and then come show me![VAR 0114(004B)]

Alola, friend! I’m a big fan of Pokémon from the\nAlola region!
Do you have an Alolan Golem in your party\nor Boxes? If so, I’d sure love to see it!
I just can’t seem to find an Alolan Golem...
That...that’s not a Golem at all!
That’s a Golem, yes, but...it’s a regular one!\nWhat I’m looking for is an ALOLAN Golem!
Why, that...that’s an Alolan Golem!
Just look at those curious protrusions above its\nhead! And its handsome eyebrows—its full beard!
It evolves when it’s traded, you know. I suppose\nthat’s why it’s not often found in the wild...
As thanks, let me teach you a pose that’s just\nperfect to show your love for Alolan Golem!
You learned the [VAR FF00(0008)]Electrium Z emote[VAR FF00(0000)] from the girl!
The hand positions are KEY for the pose I taught\nyou. And you gotta say “Alola” nice and loud!

Ohoho! Would you look at the cut of your jib!\nYou must be the one everyone’s talking ’bout.
[VAR BD06(0000)]You’re the Paldean exchange student,\n[VAR 0100(0000)],\r\nor\r\nmy\r\nname’s\r\nnot\r\nSnacksworth!
You got me!
Your name’s what?
Yes, indeed! Call me Snacksworth!
I do love to see the young students putting some\nreal effort into their self-improvement.
Especially the kids who really give their all for\nthe ol’ BBQs. I reward them with snacks!
These snacks I make are very special treats—\nmade just to the tastes of certain Pokémon!
With one of my snacks in hand, you may find\nyourself running into quite spectacular Pokémon!
So come give ol’ Snacksworth the latest whenever\nyou’ve been hard at work on those BBQs!
Now, let’s see if you’ve been chipping away at\nthose BBQs or not, [VAR 0100(0000)]...
Heavens to Betsy! You’ve gone and completed\na group quest!
Heavens to Betsy! You’ve gone and completed\n[VAR 0202(0001)] group quest[VAR 1101(0001,0100)]s!
Heavens to Betsy! You’ve gone and completed\n[VAR 0202(0001)] solo quest[VAR 1101(0001,0100)]s!
Well, shucks. It looks like it’s a bit early for you\nto be getting any of my special snacks.
I reckon you could earn one of my special snacks\nif you did [VAR 0202(0002)] more quest[VAR 1101(0002,0100)]s on your own...or\r\nmaybe [VAR 0202(0003)] more group quest[VAR 1101(0003,0100)]s.
I reckon you could earn one of my special snacks\nif you did, say, [VAR 0202(0003)] more group quest[VAR 1101(0003,0100)]s.\c\nYou’re doing fine work on those solo quests!
I reckon you could earn one of my special snacks\nif you did, say, [VAR 0202(0002)] more solo quest[VAR 1101(0002,0100)]s.\c\nYou’re doing fine work on those group quests!
You know about group quests, right? They’ll start\nappearing once you tackle a whole heap of BBQs\r\nwith your pals using the Union Circle.
Or are you just here because you’d like to hear\nmy ol’ tales about rare and wondrous Pokémon?
All right, then! What Pokémon would you like to\nhear me yammer on about? Show me their snack!
Well, friend, I don’t rightly know what to tell you.\nThat there’s no snack of mine...
You sure you want to mosey on without hearing\none of my tales? No need to be shy!
I’d say you’ve earned yourself one of my special\nsnacks, [VAR 0100(0000)].
That there’s [VAR 1302(0004,0000)][VAR 0109(0004)]!
[VAR BD06(0000)]You know [VAR 0101(0005)]? Frightfully rare,\nthat\r\none!\r\nNot\r\nyour\r\nrun-of-the-mill\r\nPokémon!
Speaking of Articuno...I do recall this one\nparticular encounter when I was a younger feller.\c\nSee, I’d found this lovely pond up in the snowy\npeaks of Paldea and had decided to go for a dip,\r\nhankering for a bit of cold-water swimming...
when—would you believe it!—Articuno comes\nswooping down along the nearby waterfall and\r\nstarts flying about above me, singing away!
I was tickled pink, I was. Went on merrily singing\nwith Articuno even as the sun set and the moon\r\nrose. Before I knew it, it was morning again!
Speaking of Zapdos...I do recall this one\nparticular encounter when I was a younger feller.\c\nI’d climbed right up to the tippy-top of one of\nthose lighthouses you’ve got in Paldea, and I was\r\ntaking in the view, looking over a distant city...
when—would you believe it!—the heavens broke\nwide open, and rain started pouring down on me!\c\nI thought I’d better get out of that mess in a\nhurry, so I turned to head down again.
Then the whole sky lit up like a huge crash of\nlightning, and Zapdos came flying outta nowhere!\r\nIt blew right by me, quick as a flash!
Speaking of Moltres...I do recall this one\nparticular encounter when I was a younger feller.\c\nI was off doing a spot of rock-climbing over in\nwestern Paldea at the time.
The weather was sure something else that day!\c\nSandstorms were kicking up the whole desert—\nmy mouth was as sandy as the ground!\c\nI was about ready to call it quits when...
Moltres appeared in a blaze of glory, so bright\nyou could see it through the blowing sands!\c\nI don’t know if it meant to cheer me on, but it\ncertainly did, and I completed my climb that day.
Speaking of Raikou...I do recall this one\nparticular encounter when I was a younger feller.\c\nYes, there was a day me and ol’ Raikou went\nracing up a mountain together.
That Raikou—it’s no slouch, that’s for sure!\nKept dashing past me and taking the lead.\c\nI was huffing and puffing and muttering some\ncolorful things as I chased that wily Pokémon.
But in the end, we were sitting side by side atop\nthat peak, gazing out upon the massive and\r\nmajestic desert that covers the land to the north.
Speaking of Entei...I do recall this one particular\nencounter when I was a younger feller.\c\nWould you believe it—I simply ran smack dab\ninto Entei while out adventuring in Paldea!
You know that stretch that’s dotted with mines,\nand everywhere you look, there’s another hole?\c\nWell, there was Entei, popping through those\ncaves like it was having a grand ol’ time!
I don’t like to be outshone, so I did my best to\nkeep up with the feller. Whoo-ee, what a chase!\c\nWe ended up all the way at the coast, side by\nside as we gazed out over the endless blue.
Speaking of Suicune...I do recall this one\nparticular encounter when I was a younger feller.\c\nSee, I spotted Suicune once, while I was out\nenjoying that famous lake you’ve got in Paldea.
We ended up having a little contest of skill,\nseeing which one of us could get all the way\r\nto shore fastest.
We were off like a shot, but that Suicune—well,\nit runs right over the water, now don’t it?\c\nMe being just your everyday human, the best\nI could manage was a nice, solid backstroke.\c\nIt was a fine race, though. Mighty fine. Even if\nthat Suicune did end up beating me by a whisker.
Speaking of Lugia...I do recall this one\nparticular encounter when I was a younger feller.\c\nI was paddling in the sea off Paldea, enjoying a\nleisurely backstroke through those crystal waters.
But it was a real frigid stretch of sea, you\nunderstand. Didn’t take long in that water before\r\nI’d started to lose all the warmth in my body!\c\nI was shaking like a leaf by the time I found an\nisland and crawled ashore.
What should appear before me but a great\nwhirlpool heaving in the sea, and—bwoosh!\r\nOut of it comes Lugia itself!\c\nI was knocked flat on my backside in the shock\nof it all, so delighted I forgot I was even cold!
Speaking of Ho-Oh...I do recall this one\nparticular encounter when I was a younger feller.\c\nNow this is a real old tale, from those long ago\ndays when I’d just started out as a Trainer...
I was down in the southwest of Paldea, near the\ncascading waterfalls down there.\c\nI’d been up through the night, training without\nrest to try to make my Pokémon stronger.
Then Ho-Oh appears in the sky above me,\nglittering and sparkling bright as you ever saw!\c\nI’d sure like to believe that it appeared there to\ncheer me on when I was trying so hard.
Speaking of Latias...I do recall this one\nparticular encounter when I was a younger feller.\c\nI was off enjoying a spot of backstroke in the\nsea to the south of Paldea at the time.
I’d been going on for a good while, so I’d come\nto feel a bit tuckered out and in need of a rest.\c\nCame ashore to rest on the sand in the shadow\nof some cliffs...
when—you won’t even believe it—there’s Latias!\nJust right there before me!\c\nOur eyes met, and it gave me a jolly little smile.\nThen it flew off again out of sight.
Speaking of Latios...I do recall this one\nparticular encounter when I was a younger feller.\c\nOne day I ran smack dab into it, brazen as you\nplease, while I was up in northeast Paldea, see.
We couldn’t speak each other’s language, but\nI got the feeling it was telling me to follow it.\c\nSo I gave chase when Latios flew off, and I\nended up climbing these mighty steep cliffs.
Next time I looked up, I realized I’d come to a\nsmall lake, nestled in between some jagged cliffs.\r\nIt was a secret spot, all right.
Speaking of Kyogre...I do recall this one\nparticular encounter when I was a younger feller.\c\nI was on another one of my adventures around\nPaldea when I spotted these odd rocks in the sea.
I thought to myself, “Now, Snacksworth, those’ve\ngot to be those famous rocks said to bring riches!”\c\nSo I figured I might as well squeeze my eyes shut\nreal tight and make a wish on ’em.
After a few seconds, I opened my eyes, and what\nshould appear in front of those rocks but Kyogre!\c\nJust big and blue and brazen as you please!\nNow that was a shocking day, make no mistake!
Speaking of Groudon...I do recall this one\nparticular encounter when I was a younger feller.\c\nI did spy ol’ Groudon once, back in the days\nwhen I was adventuring around Paldea.
You know the huge cave system under that\none town? I never can remember the name...\c\nAnyway, the name don’t matter, except to say\nthat that’s the place where I saw that feller!
I thought to myself, “Well, if that ain’t Groudon!”\nAnd I gave a big wave of my arms to say hello.\c\nWhat else are you supposed to do when faced\nwith the Continent Pokémon, I ask you?\c\nSo anyway, I did that. And then it showed me its\nhuge, fearsome claws, that it did.
Speaking of Rayquaza...I do recall this one\nparticular encounter when I was a younger feller.\c\nI was doing a bit of mountain climbing—hauling\nmyself up some mighty steep Paldean cliffs.
When I made it up to the top—now that was the\nkind of sight a man lives for!\c\nI looked down over the edge into a sea of white\nmist, unbroken as far as the eye could see!\r\nThere was something truly mystical about it all.
And what came bursting right outta that dense\nfog but ol’ Rayquaza, like a cork outta a bottle!\r\nI nearly fell back down the mountain in shock!
Speaking of Cobalion...I do recall this one\nparticular encounter when I was a younger feller.\c\nI was on one of my adventures in Paldea when\nCobalion just pranced on down from a cliff.
I was real flummoxed at first when it stopped\nright before me. Maybe it was just pausing to\r\nstare because my face looked so funny?\c\nAnyway, that ol’ Cobalion started to stroll away,\nso I followed, and it led me to a famed waterfall.
I tried to say thanks, but ol’ Cobalion just dashed\noff into the bamboo grove, cool as you please.
Speaking of Terrakion...I do recall this one\nparticular encounter when I was a younger feller.\c\nIt was just a regular day, and I was out doing a\nbit of my beloved rock-climbing, as I’m wont to.
I’d made it up quite high. When I turned around\nfor a breath, I could just make out Cortondo in\r\nthe distance, off to the south.\c\nI was simply standing there, admiring that view...\nwhen next thing I knew, Terrakion had plonked\r\ndown for a sit right beside me!
Perhaps it was simply at loose ends? It sat with\nme for a time, and we ate some snacks together.
Speaking of Virizion...I do recall this one\nparticular encounter when I was a younger feller.\c\nI tell you no lies: I simply came across Virizion\nresting among the trees one day while I was on\r\none of my adventures around Paldea!
And what trees they were! All done up in these\nmysterious patterns like I’ve never seen.\c\nWe stayed there a good while, me and Virizion,\ngazing at one another twixt those fanciful trees.
But that ol’ Virizion, it didn’t run off. Just gave\nme this curious look, you know?\c\nSo I sat there and told it about my adventures,\nand it listened with a kindly air the whole time.
Speaking of Reshiram...I do recall this one\nparticular encounter when I was a younger feller.\c\nSee, I saw Reshiram with my own eyes, out near\na town that I’d passed through in Paldea.
It was a town where a lot of hardworking folk\nlive—the type that get their hands dirty.\c\nI’d climbed up to a nice height to look out upon\nall their hard work, carved into the landscape.
I was just remarking to myself what a fine show\nof effort it was, when I seemed to feel a presence\r\nbehind me. And when I turned—bam!\c\nThere was Reshiram, right at my shoulder! I figure\nit must like good ol’-fashioned hard work, too.
Speaking of Zekrom...I do recall this one\nparticular encounter when I was a younger feller.\c\nI’d set out from Mesagoza, thinking I would walk\nall the way out to Artazon from there.
I was making fine progress, when this great black\nshadow streaks across the sky to the east.\c\nI was consumed with curiosity—that’s for sure—so\nI climbed real high to try to catch a better look...\r\nand wouldn’t you know it—there was Zekrom!
I stared up at it like a country lad seeing his first\ncity, and it came down to land right near me.\c\nWe watched one another for a time. I couldn’t\nhelp but bask in how magnificent Zekrom is.
Speaking of Kyurem...I do recall this one\nparticular encounter when I was a younger feller.\c\nSee, I was up climbing the snowy mountains when\na terrible storm blew in, and I had no choice\r\nreally but to hunker down in a cave underground.
Don’t even rightly know if I should call that place\na cave. It was all soaring heights and wide\r\npassages—befuddling as any labyrinth too.\c\nI was having a grand time exploring its many\nnooks and crannies when this sheet of ice near\r\nme suddenly up and moved!
I rubbed my eyes, not believing what I was\nseeing, once I realized—it was no ice sheet!\r\nIt was Kyurem, right there in front of me!\c\nWho would believe it, right?
Speaking of Solgaleo...I do recall this one\nparticular encounter when I was a younger feller.\c\nI’d gone to pay Paldea’s Pokémon League a little\nvisit at that fine building they’ve got there.
I was just admiring the structure from the outside\nwhen one of the staffers noticed me and invited\r\nme in for a better look.\c\nThey took me up to the observation deck,\nall done up with that logo of theirs.\c\nI was looking toward the academy and enjoying\nthe view when a shadow fell across us.
I kid you not, young friend. It was Solgaleo itself!\c\nIt was only there a moment before it dashed right\noff again in a flash, so I couldn’t even get in a\r\nhow-do-you-do. But it was magnificent!
Speaking of Lunala...I do recall this one particular\nencounter when I was a younger feller.\c\nI was on a fine sandy beach in Paldea, gazing out\nat the sun as it set into the sea.
Looking at the sun really reminds you just how\nsmall you are as one person, you know?\c\nI was getting all sentimental as I watched the\nlight slipping away.\c\nIt hadn’t yet disappeared when suddenly this\ngreat crescent moon bloomed before my eyes!
It was only there for an instant, so it was hard\nto get a good look.\c\nBut I’m sure that silhouette belonged to Lunala,\nor my name’s not Snacksworth.
Speaking of Necrozma...I do recall this one\nparticular encounter when I was a younger feller.\c\nI was sitting in the stream of one of Paldea’s\nwaterfalls, letting the pounding water cleanse\r\nmy mind...\c\nwhen I looked up and saw Necrozma sat right\nup above, giving me the ugliest glare!
I thought it’d be unwise of me not to stand my\nground, so I squared up and roared as loud as\r\nthe water! That had ol’ Necrozma off like a shot.
And it wasn’t just Necrozma either! That shout\nof mine sent all the nearby Sawsbuck scattering,\r\ntoo, wouldn’t you know it! Hahahaha!
Speaking of Kubfu...I do recall this one particular\nencounter when I was a younger feller.\c\nI was adventuring off in Paldea when I saw Kubfu\ntraining! I ambled right up to it and asked,\r\n“Ohoho, hard at work training, are you?”\c\nWhy, the two of us got on like a house on fire!
We trained together for a time, till Kubfu seemed\nto be itching to move on.
But it left me a gift—it plucked up a haul of the\nbamboo sprouts that grew nearby, just for me.
Speaking of Glastrier...I do recall this one\nparticular encounter when I was a younger feller.\c\nI was off hiking among Paldea’s peaks for a bit\nof fun, mountain climbing being a bit of a hobby.
I was trekking up and up those snowy hillsides,\nand I figured I must have been nearly to the\r\nsummit when I came across some ruins.\c\nPerhaps they’d been a house once? The walls\nstill looked sound enough that I thought I could\r\ntake shelter and have myself a little rest.
I’d no sooner drawn close for a look than this\nPokémon appeared, white as the driven snow!\c\nGlastrier’d been sleeping inside! When it popped\nits long face out, the fright nearly froze my heart!
Speaking of Spectrier...I do recall this one\nparticular encounter when I was a younger feller.\c\nI was off hiking among Paldea’s peaks for a bit\nof fun, mountain climbing being a bit of a hobby.
I was taking my sweet time meandering up some\nmountain paths dotted sparsely with trees.\c\nI came upon this old ruin on the path, covered\nin vines, and I thought to myself, “Now, doesn’t\r\nthat seem as good a place as any to take a rest?”
I’d no sooner drawn close for a look than this\nblack shadow of a Pokémon appeared!\c\nSpectrier’d been sleeping inside! It popped its\nlong face out and scared the spirit outta me!
It loves that snack you have there, so you might\njust have a shot at meeting it too!
[VAR BD06(0000)]If you run into ol’ [VAR 0101(0005)], you be sure\nto\r\ngive\r\nit\r\nmy best!
Huh? Well, knock me over with a feather! Looks\nlike you’ve completely cleared me out of snacks!
Simply goes to show how much hard work you’ve\nput into those BBQs, [VAR 0100(0000)].
I’m afraid I’ve no more snacks, but please stop\nby and lend an ear to my old tales now and then!
[VAR BD06(0000)][VAR 0100(0000)]! You back for another\nround\r\nof\r\nol’\r\nSnacksworth’s\r\ntales\r\nof glory?
Ol’ Snacksworth’s been all over the world. I’ve\nwalked many routes—and not only in Paldea.\c\nThere are so many lands to explore and so many\ntasty snacks to discover in each one...
I’ve got a knack for Pokémon battles myself,\nI’d say. Or I did in my glory days.\c\nMe and my partner Arbok were known to be\nunbeatable back in the parts where I came from.
[VAR BD06(0000)][VAR 0100(0000)]! What a delight to\nsee\r\nyou\r\nagain.\c\nSure puts a smile on my face—and a tune to my\nlips! Here, I reckon you know this one...\c\n“Oh, give me a home where the Bouffalant roam,\nwhere the Deerling and Sawsbuck still play”... ♪
My snacks are actually made using fairly\nordinary ingredients.\c\nThe Pokémon must love ’em so much because of\nthe care I put into making ’em. I imagine how\r\nhappy the Pokémon’ll be as I craft each treat.
[VAR BD06(0000)]’Course I can’t understand the tongues of\nPokémon, but when our eyes meet, it still feels\r\nas though I can guess what they’re thinking.\r\nDon’t you find that to be the case,\r\n[VAR 0100(0000)]?\c\nHahaha! Life’s a real mystery sometimes, ain’t it!

[VAR BD06(0000)]Hello, hello, [VAR 0100(0000)].\nThis is Jacq.[VAR 0114(002A)]
Hi, Mr. Jacq!
What is it?
Sorry to bother you while you’re probably out\nsearching for some nice treasure...[VAR 0114(002A)]
You see, we have a school trip every year around\nthis time.\c\nIt’s a special collaboration between our academy\nand another school.[VAR 0114(002A)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]And would you believe it,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]?\r\nYour\r\nname\r\nwas\r\none\r\nof\r\nthe\r\nones\r\nchosen\r\nto\r\nattend![VAR 0114(002A)]
You’ll get to go study and experience the great\noutdoors off to the east—in the [VAR FF00(0006)]land of Kitakami[VAR FF00(0000)]![VAR 0114(002A)]
It’s a long trip to get to this year’s destination,\nso we can’t send too many students this time.\c\nYou really are a lucky one, getting selected as\none of the participants![VAR 0114(002A)]
Come to the school’s [VAR FF00(0006)]entrance hall[VAR FF00(0000)] when you’re\nready to hear all the details.[VAR 0114(002A)]
Of course, you don’t HAVE to take part. But this\nkind of chance isn’t likely to come again, so you\r\nshould really give it a shot if you’re interested![VAR 0114(002A)]
Hope to see you soon![VAR 0114(002A)]

Hm? Are you...? Oh, you must be![VAR 0114(002C)]
You’re one of the students chosen for the school\ntrip, aren’t you? And your name was...?[VAR 0114(002C)]
[VAR 0100(0000)]!
[VAR 0100(0000)], ma’am
[VAR 0100(0000)], huh?\c\nWell, aren’t you full of fire. You’re positively\ndazzling![VAR 0114(002C)]
[VAR 0100(0000)], huh?\c\nWell, aren’t you a polite one. You’re positively\ndazzling![VAR 0114(002C)]
Oh, and you even have a Tera Orb![VAR 0114(002C)]
I guess Paldea is rich enough in resources for that\nsort of thing to be a common sight at school...\c\nUnless that’s not the case? Are you perhaps an\nespecially exceptional student?[VAR 0114(002C)]
Oh, but here I go on and on, and I haven’t even\nintroduced myself! Call me—[VAR 0114(002C)]
Ms. Briiiar! I’m so sorry I’m late![VAR 0114(002A)]
Oh, hello to you too, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nWhat a lucky scamp you are, getting to take part\nin a school trip so soon after transferring here![VAR 0114(002A)]
I sure am happy for you! I wish I could go too...[VAR 0114(002A)]
Ahem![VAR 0114(0042)]
Huh? Oh! I’m sorry, Ms. Briar. I got a bit carried\naway...[VAR 0114(002A)]
Well, as Mr. Jacq so kindly stated for me, my\nname is Briar.\c\nI’m a teacher over at Blueberry Academy.[VAR 0114(0042)]
That’s a school in the Unova region, you know.\nMs. Briar helps set the curriculum there.[VAR 0114(002A)]
This year is Blueberry Academy’s turn to run our\njoint school trip and supervise the students.\r\nThat’s why I came here to collect you.[VAR 0114(0042)]
We’ll be heading to Kitakami, a land known for\nits picturesque fields and rice paddies.\c\nThe place has a rustic feel, but there’s also\nsomething rather mysterious about it.[VAR 0114(0042)]
You see, the same energy present in Paldea’s\nTerastal phenomenon has been detected there![VAR 0114(0042)]
I’m hoping to do some digging into the matter\nmyself—in between my supervising duties.[VAR 0114(0042)]
Though I’d ALSO appreciate the chance to take a\ngood look around the Great Crater of Paldea...[VAR 0114(0042)]
Ah yes, well, there’s...not much I can do about\nthat without permission from the Pokémon\r\nLeague and Director Clavell...[VAR 0114(002A)]
Oh, I know.[VAR 0114(0042)]
I’ve already put in all the proper applications.\nI trust that I’ll get a favorable response soon?[VAR 0114(0042)]
Ah...well... Hmmm...[VAR 0114(002A)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Oh! Sorry, [VAR 0100(0000)]! Forgot all\nabout\r\nyou\r\nfor\r\na\r\nmoment\r\nthere![VAR 0114(002A)]
Anyway, the school trip. Think of it as a chance to\ncontinue your Treasure Hunt on a grander scale—\r\nto search BEYOND Paldea’s borders![VAR 0114(002A)]
I’ll even provide you with a special update to\nyour Pokédex app. If you’d get out your phone?[VAR 0114(002A)]
The [VAR FF00(0006)]Kitakami Pokédex[VAR FF00(0000)] has been added to\nyour Pokédex app!
And there we go! All done!\c\nNow you can go wild registering all the Pokémon\nyou find around Kitakami too![VAR 0114(002A)]
Oh, and don’t worry about a permission slip for\nthe trip—I already cleared things with your mom!\r\nYou just go and have fun![VAR 0114(002A)]
Haha! Your Mr. Jacq is quite charming, isn’t he?\nDelightfully direct when he wants to be.[VAR 0114(0042)]
Now then, [VAR 0100(0000)]...\c\nIt’s quite a trip to the land of Kitakami. I hope\nyou don’t mind flying. Or long bus rides.[VAR 0114(0042)]
Let me know as soon as you’re ready to set out,\nwon’t you?[VAR 0114(0042)]

[VAR BD06(0000)]Are you ready to set out for Kitakami,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0042)]
You’ll be able to come back to Paldea whenever\nyou want, so don’t worry too much, OK?[VAR 0114(0042)]
Great! We’ll set out together as a group once the\nother students arrive.\c\nI hear you were all chosen for this trip by lottery,\nso this may be the first time you meet![VAR 0114(0042)]
I know my role is to chaperone you kids around,\nbut I fully intend to have some fun of my own\r\nwhile I’m at it—just so you’re aware![VAR 0114(0042)]
By the way...\c\nDo you know of the Scarlet Book?[VAR 0114(0042)]
By the way...\c\nDo you know of the Violet Book?[VAR 0114(0042)]
I know it
Never heard of it
As you should. It was the most influential book\nof the century on the subject of the paranormal.[VAR 0114(0042)]
Really? Well, that’s unexpected. I’m quite sure\nat least one copy was donated to this school.[VAR 0114(0042)]
The author of the [VAR 1107(00FF,0304)]ScarViolet Book, Heath, was in\nfact an ancestor of mine.[VAR 0114(0042)]
I even have his original manuscript.[VAR 0114(0042)]
Look here—these are the pages that were\nblacked out and made illegible in the published\r\nversion of the book.[VAR 0114(0042)]
The Pokémon depicted on these pages is\ncalled [VAR FF00(0006)]Terapagos[VAR FF00(0000)].[VAR 0114(0042)]
It’s a mysterious Pokémon that Heath allegedly\nencountered when he delved even further into\r\nthe depths of Area Zero...\c\nNot that the general public believed him.[VAR 0114(0042)]
It’s my dream to find Terapagos and prove that\nHeath’s records were all true.[VAR 0114(0042)]
Though I haven’t yet been able to secure\npermission to enter Area Zero, unfortunately...[VAR 0114(0042)]
But that’s fine! It’ll all be fine. All I need to do\nnow is focus on the work that’s in front of me.[VAR 0114(0042)]
Ms. Briar! We’re ready to go!
Looks like the gang’s all here.[VAR 0114(0042)]

And we haven’t lost anyone along the way?[VAR 0114(0042)]
All here!
Then welcome to the land of Kitakami![VAR 0114(0042)]
This is the stage for all the new experiences and\nlearning opportunities you’ll have out in nature![VAR 0114(0042)]
It’s actually my first time here too. Why, the rice\nfields really are just dazzling![VAR 0114(0042)]
Up ahead is Mossui Town. That will be our base\nof operations for the duration of the trip![VAR 0114(0042)]
M-Ms. Briar... I don’t feel so good...
Uh-oh! All that travel must have given you a dose\nof motion sickness, hm?[VAR 0114(0042)]
Why don’t we pause here for a moment and take\nin the sight of these fields?[VAR 0114(0042)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Now, [VAR 0100(0000)]... I have a little\nrequest\r\nfor you.[VAR 0114(0042)]
Could you run ahead to the community center in\nMossui and let the caretaker know we’re here?[VAR 0114(0042)]
It would also be great if you could explain that\none of our students is feeling unwell.[VAR 0114(0042)]
I can do that
I’m on it!
I knew I’d be able to count on you.\c\nOn your way, then! I’ll look after your poor travel\nbuddy here.[VAR 0114(0042)]
This is my first time in another region! It even\nSMELLS different here!
Do you think he’s all right? That was one bumpy\nbus ride.
Ugh... My head... So this is how Psyduck\nmust feel...

I’m Carmine.[VAR 0114(0044)]
Sorry, but I can’t just let an outsider like you\nwander into Mossui Town.[VAR 0114(0044)]

C-c’mon, Sis... You just wanna battle. Makin’ this\nbig fuss over nothing...[VAR 0114(0043)]
I told you to hush, Kiki![VAR 0114(0044)]
Just ignore my little brother.[VAR 0114(0044)]

All right, let’s do this. Get in position.[VAR 0114(0044)]
I’m going to have some real good fun with you.[VAR 0114(0044)]
Wowzers! You went and beat my sis?![VAR 0114(0043)]
Wowzers! You’re almost as strong as my sis![VAR 0114(0043)]
I can’t believe it... There’s no way you should’ve\nbeen able to beat me![VAR 0114(0044)]
Huh... Didn’t expect you to put up such a fight\nagainst me.[VAR 0114(0044)]
...Fine, I guess you pass. Barely.[VAR 0114(0044)]
Seems I’ve got no choice. I’ll let you into town,\nbut only if you become one of my grunts and do\r\nevery little thing I—[VAR 0114(0044)]
Oi! What’re you doing, causing a ruckus out here![VAR 0114(002C)]

Why, hello there, stranger! You must be one of\nthe students from that Paldean academy, right?[VAR 0114(002C)]
I help run the community center here in Mossui\nTown—and a fair few other things besides!\r\nI’ll be looking after your group during your visit.[VAR 0114(0045)]
I hope those two kids weren’t giving you any\ngrief just now...were they?[VAR 0114(0045)]
I hardly know what to do with the two of them...\nEspecially that Carmine. Always been a handful,\r\nthat one. I apologize if she gave you a hard time.[VAR 0114(0045)]
What’s that?! A member of your group fell ill\ndown by the bus stop?![VAR 0114(0045)]
I’d better get over there and give them a hand\nso they can make it into town![VAR 0114(0045)]
I’ll take care of everything. You go ahead and get\nyourself settled in at the community center.[VAR 0114(0045)]
We’ll catch up with you soon![VAR 0114(0045)]
The road to this town is awful pitted and bumpy.\nIt’s not unusual for folks to get carsick from it.[VAR 0114(0045)]
Motion sickness happens when something upsets\nthe sensory system in your ears that helps you\r\nmaintain balance. All that shaking will do it![VAR 0114(0042)]
Better head to the community center!

All right, everyone! This is the community center![VAR 0114(0045)]
This is where you’ll be staying while you’re here\nin Kitakami.[VAR 0114(0045)]
The plan was to have you and the students from\nBlueberry Academy stay here together...[VAR 0114(0045)]

Oh, no need to worry about your shoes or\nanything. You can leave them on in here.\c\nIf they’re extra dirty, just try to rinse off the worst\nof the mud using the washing station by the door.[VAR 0114(0045)]
Nice and clean inside, don’t you think? It’s all\nnewly built, so it’s as good as anything you’d\r\nfind in one of your big, fancy cities![VAR 0114(0045)]
This here is the lounge. You can watch TV, chat,\nor relax however you like.[VAR 0114(0045)]
And, well, let’s see... Over there is the cafeteria.\nAnd toilets will be down that way...[VAR 0114(0045)]
When you want to get some sleep, please use\nthe rooms down the hall there.[VAR 0114(0045)]
We’ve got enough space that each of you can\nhave a private room to yourself.[VAR 0114(0045)]
So I think...that about covers everything![VAR 0114(0045)]
But if you run into any trouble at all, don’t you\nhesitate to talk to our fine staff at the desk![VAR 0114(0045)]
Thank you for the tour, sir.[VAR 0114(0042)]
All right, kids, do you have anything to say to\nthe staff who’ll be taking such good care of us?[VAR 0114(0042)]
We’re glad to be here!
Thanks for having us!
GLAD TO BE HEEERE!!!
THANK YOU FOR HAVING UUUS!!!
What a bunch of well-mannered students! I can\nalready tell you’re going to be wonderful visitors.[VAR 0114(0045)]
So you just think of this place as your own home\naway from home, and relax![VAR 0114(0045)]
You must all be tired after such a long day.[VAR 0114(0042)]
I know it’s a bit early still, but why don’t we\nhave dinner, then call it a night?[VAR 0114(0042)]
We’ve got plenty of food ready for you all,\nso I hope you’ve brought your appetites![VAR 0114(0045)]
All right!
Thanks for dinner!
You’re free to spend the rest of the evening as\nyou like in the community center.\c\nBut remember that tomorrow, the program will\nbe officially kicking off.[VAR 0114(0042)]
Don’t stay up too late, or you might oversleep![VAR 0114(0042)]
Did you enjoy the taste of our local Kitakami\nfare?[VAR 0114(0045)]
The Blueberry students will join us tomorrow.\nI hope you all get along![VAR 0114(0042)]
I wonder what’s scheduled for tomorrow... I’m so\nexcited, I don’t think I can sleep!

Morning, everyone! Did you sleep well?[VAR 0114(0042)]
Starting today, you’ll be joined by our two\nstudents from Blueberry Academy.[VAR 0114(0042)]
Go on, kids! Time to introduce yourselves.[VAR 0114(0042)]
Hi! I’m Carmine![VAR 0114(0044)]
It’s a pleasure to meet all you outsiders—I mean,\nvisitors from Paldea! Hee hee![VAR 0114(0044)]
I-I’m...Kieran...[VAR 0114(0043)]
Carmine and Kieran actually grew up here, so ask\nthem for help if you need anything.[VAR 0114(0045)]
And you two had better be of real help, you\nhear me?[VAR 0114(0045)]
Aye-aye.[VAR 0114(0044)]
R-right...[VAR 0114(0043)]
Now that that’s settled... Why don’t I tell you all\na bit about what we have planned for you?[VAR 0114(0045)]
This school trip of yours will be an exercise in\norienteering![VAR 0114(0045)]
First, we’ll have you split into pairs. Then each\npair will be tasked with finding [VAR FF00(0006)]three signboards[VAR FF00(0000)]\r\nlocated around the land of Kitakami.[VAR 0114(0045)]
On each signboard, you’ll find snippets of an\nold folktale passed down here in Kitakami.\r\nRead them all and learn a bit about our home.[VAR 0114(0045)]
To prove you’ve completed the task, we ask that\neach pair take a snapshot together in front of\r\nthese signboards with their phone or camera.[VAR 0114(0045)]
Take a photo together in front of each of the\nthree signboards to complete your mission![VAR 0114(0045)]
It’s a self-guided tour of Kitakami! Learn all\nabout its rich history![VAR 0114(0045)]
Much more fun than sitting around and listening\nto me ramble on and on, eh?[VAR 0114(0045)]
Wonderful! What an innovative idea for a group\nactivity![VAR 0114(0042)]
Oh, and I’ve got a gift for each of you as well![VAR 0114(0045)]
I hear these things’re all the rage in the big cities.\nUse them when you take those photos![VAR 0114(0045)]
I’ll even teach you a rad pose I came up with all\non my own.[VAR 0114(0045)]
You learned the [VAR FF00(0008)]Eureka emote[VAR FF00(0000)] from the\ncaretaker!
Ah, yes. Real...rad...[VAR 0114(0042)]
Remember that one of the goals of this trip is to\ndeepen the ties between our two schools.[VAR 0114(0042)]
It seems like having someone who knows the\narea well would be a big help. That being said...[VAR 0114(0042)]
Let’s try to maximize the number of interschool\npairs, OK? Time to mingle![VAR 0114(0042)]
Be sure to tell me if Carmine or Kieran cause\nyou any trouble during your stay.[VAR 0114(0045)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]We’ve got four students from [VAR 1107(00FF,0206)]NaranjUva Academy\nand\r\nonly two from Blueberry...\c\nSo that means at least one pair will be made up\nof just kids from our school, right?
That girl, Carmine... I’m not sure I trust that\ncheery greeting from her.
What?! I don’t want to have to pair up with\nsomeone I don’t even know!
Aw man...[VAR 0114(0043)]
Try talking to the other kids! It’s time to make\nsome new friends!

You’re [VAR 0100(0000)] or whatever, right?[VAR 0114(0044)]
Let me guess—you want to pair up with one of us\npoor, lonely Blueberry students?[VAR 0114(0044)]
Gosh, it’s so sweet of you to go out of your way\nlike that. What would we ever do without you?[VAR 0114(0044)]
Wait, but you’re the one who came to talk to us.\nWhat are you, some kinda weirdo?[VAR 0114(0044)]
Oh yeah. So my little brother here has been\nall googly-eyed over you since yesterday.[VAR 0114(0044)]
He wouldn’t stop talking about you—even at\nhome. I seriously couldn’t get him to shut up.[VAR 0114(0044)]
S-Sis! What’re you tellin’ h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]imer that for, dummy![VAR 0114(0043)]
HEY! Watch who you call “dummy,” if you know\nwhat’s good for you![VAR 0114(0044)]
Aw man...[VAR 0114(0043)]
Look at him, being all shy...[VAR 0114(0044)]
See, my brother’s no good at talking to people.[VAR 0114(0044)]
He’d probably never work up the nerve to ask\nyou himself, but he’d really like a battle with you.[VAR 0114(0044)]
C’mon, please? Just have a battle with my\nbrother, would you?[VAR 0114(0044)]
Huh? What’s that? I couldn’t hear you.\c\nWhen you’ve cleared your throat of whatever\nthat was and are ready to say yes, lemme know.[VAR 0114(0044)]
Well, what do you know—turns out you’re sorta\nnice. This’ll make my brother real happy.[VAR 0114(0044)]
Chin up, Kiki!\c\n[VAR 0100(0000)] says [VAR 1100(00FF,0100)]she’ll battle you![VAR 0114(0044)]
What?![VAR 0114(0043)]
W-wowzers, really?! You don’t mind?![VAR 0114(0043)]
[VAR 1100(00FF,0201)]HShe doesn’t mind a bit.[VAR 0114(0044)]
Get to your positions, you two. Everybody else,\nclear out. Make some space![VAR 0114(0044)]
I-I got this![VAR 0114(0043)]
Good show!
Nicely done, kids! Nothing like a friendly battle\nto get to know someone![VAR 0114(0042)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]W-wowzers! You sure are strong,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0043)]
That was some kinda battle!\c\nI bet you’re something else when you’re not\nholdin’ back, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0043)]
You really aren’t half bad. Kiki’s nearly as strong\nas I am, you know.[VAR 0114(0044)]
I dunno about that...[VAR 0114(0043)]
This orienteering thing... We’re supposed to\ngroup up in pairs, right?[VAR 0114(0044)]
You should go ahead and pair up with Kiki, then.[VAR 0114(0044)]
What?! No, Sis, don’t—![VAR 0114(0043)]
Don’t what? It’s not like we can pair up. Or were\nyou hoping to partner with some other rando\r\noutsider instead of [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0044)]
Well...no, but... Aw man...[VAR 0114(0043)]
Don’t worry. He’s just being shy.[VAR 0114(0044)]
I’ll go find some chump to pair up with too.\nWatch out for my little bro, you.[VAR 0114(0044)]
Looks like you’ve all paired up![VAR 0114(0045)]
Let’s go ahead and mark where you’ll be going\non those Rotom Phones of yours.[VAR 0114(0045)]
Now then, off you go to do some exploring![VAR 0114(0045)]
Oh, and if you find yourself in need of any\nPotions or Poké Balls or the like...[VAR 0114(0045)]
head on over thataway and stop by Peachy’s!\nThey’d be happy to set you to rights.[VAR 0114(0045)]
U-um...[VAR 0114(0043)]
So it looks like...we should probably start with\nthe signboard at...[VAR FF00(0006)]Loyalty Plaza[VAR FF00(0000)]...\c\nThat’s out past the apple orchards on the west\nside of the village...[VAR 0114(0043)]
It’s close by. And I figure it might, um, make\nsense to...y’know...visit them all in order...[VAR 0114(0043)]
I’ll probably just get in your way if I stick too\nclose, so I’ll just...follow you from a safe distance![VAR 0114(0043)]
Welcome to Kitakami Hall! We’re glad to have\nyou here. Relax and enjoy yourself![VAR 0114(0045)]
Nice to meet you, Carmine!
I felt bad leaving this kid on his own, so I guess\nI’ll partner up with him.
I can’t wait to see what Pokémon we discover\nwhile looking for those signboards!
Let’s do this, outsider—I mean, uh, totally\nordinary guy![VAR 0114(0044)]
Finally time to kick off this school trip in earnest.\nGet out there and do some orienteering!\c\nYou’ve come all the way here to Kitakami, so you\nshould see everything it’s got to offer![VAR 0114(0042)]

[VAR BD06(0000)][VAR 0100(0000)]! Didja have trouble\ngetting\r\nacross\r\nthat\r\nnarrow\r\npath?[VAR 0114(0043)]
There it is...the Dreaded Den. This is s’posed to\nbe the ogre’s home...[VAR 0114(0043)]
At least, that’s what everyone says. I come here\nall the time, but I’VE never seen it...[VAR 0114(0043)]
Maybe a powerful ogre like that would only show\nup if it heard some kinda battle goin’ on...[VAR 0114(0043)]
O-oh yeah... I think I’ve gotten a bit stronger\nsince the last time we battled, so...y’know...\r\nif you wanted to...we could battle?[VAR 0114(0043)]
Let’s do it!
I don’t know...
All right! Though, uh, we should heal up our\nteams first.[VAR 0114(0043)]
C’mon... I’ll even heal up your Pokémon for you\nfirst, [VAR 0100(0000)]. So please...[VAR 0114(0043)]
I’ll give it all I got. I-I got this![VAR 0114(0043)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]I knew it... You really are strong,\n[VAR 0100(0000)].\r\nHow\r\nam\r\nI\r\never\r\ngonna\r\nbe\r\nable\r\nto\r\nbeat\r\nyou?[VAR 0114(0043)]
If the ogre saw that battle, I’m sure it’d be\nthinking, “That kid’s got real strength...”[VAR 0114(0043)]
See, my school...Blueberry Academy...[VAR 0114(0043)]
It’s a school that specializes in teachin’ the art of\nPokémon battlin’.[VAR 0114(0043)]
If I was as strong as you...maybe I could aim to\nbe the best Trainer there.[VAR 0114(0043)]
Let’s go have a look at the ogre’s den.[VAR 0114(0043)]
Watch your head.[VAR 0114(0043)]
See how dark it is in here? And cramped...\nEven the floor’s all rough and uneven.[VAR 0114(0043)]
Living all alone in a place like this would get\npretty miserable, don’t you think?[VAR 0114(0043)]
Poor ogre... We have plenty of room at our\nhouse. I would’ve totally let it stay with us...[VAR 0114(0043)]
You’re a sweet kid, Kieran
When can I move in?
N-no, I’m not! I’ve just...always liked the stories\nabout the ogre, that’s all...[VAR 0114(0043)]
I don’t know if we’d have room for the both of\nyou, [VAR 0100(0000)]...[VAR 0114(0043)]
B-but...if the ogre really did show up to stay at\nour place, I’m sure the whole town would freak.[VAR 0114(0043)]
Whoa, no way... The sun’s already gone down?[VAR 0114(0043)]
I guess we’ll have to save the last signboard for\ntomorrow...[VAR 0114(0043)]
Oh! I almost forgot!\c\nToday’s the first day of the Festival of Masks\nover at Kitakami Hall.[VAR 0114(0043)]
It’s this big event where everyone puts on masks\nand runs around celebratin’...[VAR 0114(0043)]
I mean, it’s not like you’ve gotta go or anything,\nbut if you wanted to...y’know...check it out...\r\nwell, it’d be fun.[VAR 0114(0043)]
Let’s go together!
It does sound fun
Y-yeah! Why not![VAR 0114(0043)]
I, um...I can show you to it![VAR 0114(0043)]
It’d be great to go together...[VAR 0114(0043)]
There’s just a few things we’d have to get ready\nfirst, so we should swing by my house before\r\nheading to the festival.[VAR 0114(0043)]
[~ 43]
We live in the northwest corner of the village.\nIt’s...um...let’s see, I could maybe draw a map...[VAR 0114(0043)]
Oh, your Rotom Phone has a map in it, huh?[VAR 0114(0043)]
You want me to register it on your map? Yeah,\nI could give that a try...[VAR 0114(0043)]
Wowzers! It sure is handy having a map that\nshows you everything right there in your phone...[VAR 0114(0043)]
I’m gonna ask if I can get a Rotom Phone\nsomeday too![VAR 0114(0043)]
I’ll be right behind you, if you wanna head to my\nfamily’s place first. See you there![VAR 0114(0043)]

I sure am!
I’d say so
What?! R-really?! We’re friends?[VAR 0114(0043)]
F-friends... I feel all tingly and funny hearing\nthat... Ehehe...[VAR 0114(0043)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Thank you for befriending our Kieran here,\n[VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0030)]

Come now, Kieran. You too, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0037)]
I’ll get out some jinbei for you both so you can\ngo to the festival all gussied up.[VAR 0114(0037)]

[VAR BD06(0000)]I imagine a stylish young thing like yourself could\nmake good use of this too,\r\n[VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0037)]
Having that card should open up all sorts of new\nlooks for you at the big-city shops and salons.[VAR 0114(0037)]
Hey, Gran, d’you know where my—?[VAR 0114(0044)]
Gah! What’re YOU doing here?[VAR 0114(0044)]

What’s it matter anyway! What’re YOU doin’\nback here?![VAR 0114(0043)]
Oh, right. Gran, I couldn’t find my mask for the\nfestival.[VAR 0114(0044)]
Oh, the masks? They should be in the shed.\nI put them there after last year’s festival.[VAR 0114(0037)]
It shouldn’t be locked, so you three can go have\na rummage and see what you find.[VAR 0114(0030)]
All right! To the shed! First one there wins![VAR 0114(0044)]
Wait—Sis! You’re such a cheater![VAR 0114(0043)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Please forgive those two,\n[VAR 0100(0000)].\r\nThey\r\ncan\r\nbe\r\na\r\nbit\r\nrambunctious.[VAR 0114(0030)]

Tch! Just rolling up like you own the place.[VAR 0114(0044)]
Well, it looks like there’re only two masks in the\nshed.[VAR 0114(0044)]
Too bad, right? There’s nothing I can do ’bout it![VAR 0114(0044)]
Guess you’ll just have to do without a mask, eh?\nFirst come, first served, and all that![VAR 0114(0044)]
Seriously?
That’s fine...
C’mon now, don’t look so glum![VAR 0114(0044)]
How about instead of a mask, I give you a battle\nin style? Festival style![VAR 0114(0044)]
Come on! Get in position![VAR 0114(0044)]
...Oh well! It’s not like beating me was gonna\ncause another mask to magically appear.[VAR 0114(0044)]
Now then, let me get MY mask...[VAR 0114(0044)]
How’s that? Look good, don’t I?[VAR 0114(0044)]

I know my sis seems kinda harsh, b-but she’s\nreally not all that bad...[VAR 0114(0043)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Actually, she was tearin’ the shed apart, tryin’ to\nfind a third mask for you before you got there...\c\nO-oh, but, uh, don’t tell her I told you that,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0043)]
The Festival of Masks is held up at Kitakami Hall.[VAR 0114(0043)]
W-we should probably get going...[VAR 0114(0043)]
Carmine went to the festival?! W-we’re supposed\nto be partners, but she didn’t even invite me...
The guidebook I read said that the Festival of\nMasks has a really long history.
We got to Kitakami just in time for a festival?!\nHow lucky is that!
The Festival of Masks begins tonight at Kitakami\nHall. Take your time and enjoy yourself![VAR 0114(0045)]

This is the Festival of Masks! Today’s just the first\nday. It’ll keep going for a while...[VAR 0114(0043)]
I bet you don’t have any festivals this big over\nin Paldea or wherever, right?[VAR 0114(0044)]
That’s true!
... ... ...
Heh... Knew it. See, Kitakami’s just as good as\nany of your big, shiny cities.[VAR 0114(0044)]
Oh no! Guess it’s so incredible you’re at a loss\nfor words, huh?[VAR 0114(0044)]
It’s OK, [VAR 0100(0000)]. Just ignore her...[VAR 0114(0043)]

C’mon, you two. Scooch in closer![VAR 0114(0044)]
Ow! You’re steppin’ on my toe, Sis![VAR 0114(0043)]
Oh, stop complaining! This’ll only take a second![VAR 0114(0044)]
OK, are you all ready? Say Chansey![VAR 0114(0044)]
Now that’s what I call a nice festival vibe![VAR 0114(0044)]
The Festival of Masks is held so we can all honor\nthe [VAR FF00(0006)]Loyal Three[VAR FF00(0000)], the brave heroes of Kitakami![VAR 0114(0044)]
The Loyal Three are the Pokémon that once\nprotected this land from the evil ogre, you know.[VAR 0114(0044)]
Most of the kids in town wear masks of the Loyal\nThree, like me. Did I mention they’re our heroes?[VAR 0114(0044)]
Hehehe...[VAR 0114(0043)]
What? What’re you laughin’ at?[VAR 0114(0044)]
N-nothin’! I was just thinkin’ it was funny that,\nlike...you don’t know anything about the ogre...[VAR 0114(0043)]
What?! I know the legends of Kitakami better\nthan anybody!\c\nPretty gutsy of you to laugh at your big sis![VAR 0114(0044)]
S-sorry...[VAR 0114(0043)]
Kiki’s still a little baby, so of course he thinks\nsome kind of terrible monster’s cool. He likes\r\nthe ogre more than the Loyal Three.[VAR 0114(0044)]
Oh, look! They’ve got candy apples! Let’s go\ncheck out the stalls![VAR 0114(0043)]
That brother of mine’s awfully quick to run away\nwhen he doesn’t like what’s being said.[VAR 0114(0044)]
You should check out the festival before you go!
H-heeey! Over here![VAR 0114(0043)]

You sure?
Grandma gave me some pocket money, so it’s no\nbig deal.[VAR 0114(0043)]
I love candy apples. You don’t get to eat ’em\nevery day, y’know?[VAR 0114(0043)]
Grandma always just makes us mochi as a snack...[VAR 0114(0043)]
There’s even a Pokémon in Kitakami that looks\nlike a little ol’ candy apple—didja know that?[VAR 0114(0043)]
Hey, let’s check that out over there![VAR 0114(0043)]

Kiki’s no use at all! Zero talent for oustin’ ogres,\nI’m telling you![VAR 0114(0044)]
!!!
Hey, who was that?[VAR 0114(0044)]
Was that someone from Paldea? Definitely not a\nkid from the village.[VAR 0114(0044)]
I don’t wanna pop the Ogre Balloons, but my sis\nkeeps insistin’ I do it...[VAR 0114(0043)]
You should follow the mysterious child!

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Wait, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0044)]
You shouldn’t run off on your own.[VAR 0114(0044)]
Hey, new kid! That goes for you too![VAR 0114(0044)]
You should come back! The mountain’s\ndangerous at night![VAR 0114(0044)]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Text File : sdc01_0190
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You found the [VAR FF00(0008)]Teal Mask[VAR FF00(0000)]!
You put the Teal Mask in your Bag’s [VAR FF00(0008)]Key Items[VAR FF00(0000)]\npocket.
Who was that? Where’d that kid come from...?[VAR 0114(0044)]
I don’t think it’s a kid
Was it a Pokémon...?
What’re you talking about? Wait, do you mean...?[VAR 0114(0044)]
That kid we just saw... They ran off toward the\nmountain...[VAR 0114(0044)]
C-could that have been the ogre?! From the story\non all the signboards?[VAR 0114(0044)]
Are you saying that story was TRUE?![VAR 0114(0044)]
I mean, they did drop a mask...so they really\nmust be...[VAR 0114(0044)]
[VAR 0100(0000)]! Sis![VAR 0114(0043)]
What’re you guys doin’ over here?[VAR 0114(0043)]
Oh, we just bumped into the ogre!
There was an ogre here, and—
HEY! Wait—stop stop stop![VAR 0114(0044)]
Wh-what? Why’re you yellin’ all of a sudden, Sis?[VAR 0114(0043)]
It’s nothing! It’s nothing you’d be interested in at\nall, I swear![VAR 0114(0044)]
Huh.[VAR 0114(0043)]
Oh, I get it. I bet you were makin’ fun of me\nbehind my back...[VAR 0114(0043)]
I’m just...gonna head back to the festival...[VAR 0114(0043)]
Whew. At least he didn’t figure out what we were\nreally talking about.[VAR 0114(0044)]
Don’t scare me like that—blabbing for the whole\nworld to hear! Don’t you have any filter?[VAR 0114(0044)]
See, Kiki really likes the ogre. Like, really, really,\nREALLY likes it.[VAR 0114(0044)]
So, if he found out we’d seen the ogre without\nhim... I guess I was afraid he’d feel bad, y’know?\r\nFeel left out or something... Am I overthinking it?[VAR 0114(0044)]
’Sides, I didn’t want him running up the mountain\nto follow the ogre at this hour, either.[VAR 0114(0044)]
Well...in any case, we already lied about it, and\nthat’s that.[VAR 0114(0044)]
Let’s keep this whole thing our little secret, OK?[VAR 0114(0044)]
And maybe hold off on showing Kiki that mask\nyou just picked up, too.[VAR 0114(0044)]
Hee hee... The festival’s so much fun! And\nabsolutely NOTHING weird happened, right?[VAR 0114(0044)]
You’d better not go up the mountain...
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Text File : sdc01_0200
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Had enough of the festival?[VAR 0114(0043)]
The festival isn’t gonna end anytime soon.\nDon’t overdo it, ’K?[VAR 0114(0043)]
Well then, guess we should head home. I’ll walk\nyou back to the community center.[VAR 0114(0043)]
The next day...
The candy fruits at the Festival of Masks had such\nan interesting flavor...[VAR 0114(0042)]
Today I’m definitely going to get started on\norienteering with Carmine! My heart’s pounding...
You already found two signs, huh? We’ve only\nfound one, but there’s no harm in going at our\r\nown pace.
I’m starting to like bug Pokémon! Yanma’s so cool!

There you are, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nJust because we didn’t agree to meet doesn’t\nmean you get to keep me waiting![VAR 0114(0044)]
So, uh, y’see...I wanted to talk to you a bit.[VAR 0114(0044)]
You haven’t told anybody about the, y’know...\nthe thing that happened yesterday? Right?![VAR 0114(0044)]
No, I haven’t!
What thing?
You better not be lying! If I find out you blabbed,\nI’m gonna make you swallow a Koffing whole![VAR 0114(0044)]
Come on—you know exactly what I’m talking\nabout! We bumped into the oguuur...t. Yogurt.\r\nYes, yogurt! So don’t play dumb, got it?![VAR 0114(0044)]
You still have that thing we picked up at the\nstairs, right?[VAR 0114(0044)]
My grandpa knows a lot about the village’s\nhistory. We should go talk to him about what\r\nhappened yesterday![VAR 0114(0044)]
You know where my house is, right? See you\nthere. Don’t keep me waiting.[VAR 0114(0044)]
Let’s show Grandpa the...y’know...the thing\nwe found.[VAR 0114(0044)]
I’ve only been able to visit one sign! Carmine’s\njust nowhere to be found!\c\nThe way she marches to the beat of her own\ndrum sure is something, though...
Kieran’s pretty shy, huh? Though he seems to\nhave opened up to you.
The humid heat is still bugging me, but I’ve\ngotten used to being around bug Pokémon!
The Festival of Masks will go on for a while, so\nplease enjoy it to your heart’s content![VAR 0114(0045)]

Good morning to you, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0030)]
Hey, [VAR 0100(0000)]! G’mornin’![VAR 0114(0043)]
Tsk, he’s awake, huh.[VAR 0114(0044)]
Wanna go see the last signboard?[VAR 0114(0043)]
Kiki, go find someplace else to be![VAR 0114(0044)]
[VAR 0100(0000)]’s got business with me![VAR 0114(0044)]
Seriously? [VAR 1100(00FF,0201)]HShe’s spending all h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]iser time with you...\nThat’s so unfair! You can be such a jerk...[VAR 0114(0043)]
What’d you just call me?![VAR 0114(0044)]
Hmph![VAR 0114(0043)]
What’s his deal? Kiki should know better than\nto talk back to me like that.[VAR 0114(0044)]
That’s enough, Carmine! Be kind to your\nyounger brother.[VAR 0114(0030)]
I WAS being kind! It’s not like I hit him\nor anything![VAR 0114(0044)]
... ... ...[VAR 0114(0030)]
Anyway, we’ve got more important things to\ndiscuss, right, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0044)]
C’mon! You gotta show Grandpa that thing\nyou have![VAR 0114(0044)]
Hm. And this is...?[VAR 0114(0030)]
No, not that! I’m talkin’ about that thing we\nfound yesterday![VAR 0114(0044)]
Could this be...?[VAR 0114(0030)]
This mask—it belongs to that poor ogre!\nWhere did you find this?![VAR 0114(0030)]
We bumped into it! The ogre, I mean!\nYesterday, at the Festival of Masks![VAR 0114(0044)]
I tried talking to it all nice and everything, but it\ndropped that mask and... Yeah.[VAR 0114(0044)]
I never would have thought that the ogre would\nstill be gracing our festival with its presence...[VAR 0114(0030)]
Huh? What do you mean “still”? I thought the\nogre was a scoundrel that attacked the village.[VAR 0114(0044)]
I suppose it’s time I told you, Carmine...[VAR 0114(0030)]
You see, the truth of what happened with that\nogre...is the other way around.[VAR 0114(0030)]
The other way around? What do you mean?![VAR 0114(0044)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]You should hear this too, [VAR 0100(0000)]. You\nalso\r\nmet\r\nthe\r\npoor\r\nogre...\r\nOr\r\n[VAR FF00(0001)]Ogerpon[VAR FF00(0000)],\r\nas\r\nit’s\r\nrightly named.[VAR 0114(0030)]
Let me tell you the true story, as passed down\nthrough our family for generations...[VAR 0114(0030)]
The ogre is called Ogerpon?! And the real story’s\n“the other way around”? What does that even\r\nmean?! Come on, we need to hear this out![VAR 0114(0044)]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Text File : sdc01_0230
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This is going to be a bit of a long story to tell...\nIs that all right?[VAR 0114(0030)]
Well, do let me know when it is all right, then.[VAR 0114(0030)]
This story has been passed down in our family by\nword of mouth. I learned it from my father.[VAR 0114(0030)]
It’s a story of truths... A story that must never\nbe told to the rest of the village.[VAR 0114(0030)]
You must never speak of it to others.[VAR 0114(0030)]
OK...[VAR 0114(0044)]
A long, long time ago, a man and an ogre came\nto Kitakami from a foreign land.[VAR 0114(0030)]
The people of the village feared the man and the\nogre, who looked so different from them...[VAR 0114(0030)]
And so they refused to let the travelers come\nanywhere near the village.[VAR 0114(0030)]
The man and the ogre were saddened that the\nvillagers did not welcome them...[VAR 0114(0030)]
But they were happy just to have each other.\nThey settled quietly in a cave on the mountain.[VAR 0114(0030)]
There was only one villager who pitied the two\ntravelers: the village mask maker.[VAR 0114(0030)]
He made several masks for the man and the ogre.[VAR 0114(0030)]
The masks were brilliant works, adorned with\ngems the man brought from somewhere far away.[VAR 0114(0030)]
By wearing these masks, the travelers could hide\ntheir true faces and mingle with the villagers.[VAR 0114(0030)]
The man and the ogre were overjoyed.\nThey thanked the mask maker for his kindness.[VAR 0114(0030)]
Wearing the masks, the man and the ogre started\nsecretly joining the village festival.[VAR 0114(0030)]
The mysterious pair soon became the talk of the\nvillage because of their brilliant masks.[VAR 0114(0030)]
In fact, rumors about them quickly spread far and\nwide, even to distant lands.[VAR 0114(0030)]
But rumors of exquisite, shining masks attract\nmore than just innocent curiosity...[VAR 0114(0030)]
A group of greedy Pokémon soon made their way\nto the land of Kitakami.[VAR 0114(0030)]
These Pokémon sneaked into the cave in which\nthe man and the ogre lived...[VAR 0114(0030)]
and tried to make off with the masks, which were\ncarefully stored away.[VAR 0114(0030)]
The man happened to be there. He managed to\nhold on to one of the masks...[VAR 0114(0030)]
but he was not strong enough to protect them all.\nThe Pokémon stole the other three masks.[VAR 0114(0030)]
Several hours later, when the ogre returned to\nthe cave...[VAR 0114(0030)]
it found its beloved home in ruin. All that was left\nwere the signs of a struggle and a teal mask.[VAR 0114(0030)]
The ogre donned that mask and went down to\nthe village, perhaps to search for its friend.[VAR 0114(0030)]
It found the greedy Pokémon there, gloating over\ntheir stolen masks, and defeated them.[VAR 0114(0030)]
The villagers, of course, had no idea what was\nhappening nor why.[VAR 0114(0030)]
All they saw was the raging ogre. And they felt\ngreat fear.[VAR 0114(0030)]
The villagers thought the three Pokémon had\nfallen trying to protect the village from the ogre.[VAR 0114(0030)]
To honor their sacrifice, the villagers named them\nthe Loyal Three and interred them with care.[VAR 0114(0030)]
Wounded and weak, the ogre returned to its\ncave—alone and with great sadness.[VAR 0114(0030)]

Text File : sdc01_0260
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
That’s terrible...[VAR 0114(0044)]
Ogerpon didn’t deserve that! And the Loyal\nThree—they’re the worst![VAR 0114(0044)]
The story everyone’s been told is the complete\nopposite of the truth! They gotta hear about this![VAR 0114(0044)]
Calm yourself, Carmine! I told you already to\nkeep it to yourself![VAR 0114(0030)]
But, Grandpa—[VAR 0114(0044)]
The villagers believe their own version of history.[VAR 0114(0030)]
They revere the Loyal Three—so how would they\nreact to being told that they’ve got it all wrong?[VAR 0114(0030)]
They’d probably get...angry?[VAR 0114(0044)]
Exactly.[VAR 0114(0030)]
Back when this all first occurred, the mask\nmaker—that is to say, our ancestor—tried\r\ndesperately to tell the truth of the matter.[VAR 0114(0030)]
But nobody would take him seriously. In fact, it’s\nsaid he was persecuted as a heretic.[VAR 0114(0030)]
Oooh, that REALLY gets my blood boiling![VAR 0114(0044)]
In the end, the mask maker chose to protect his\ndescendants—us—by keeping his mouth shut.[VAR 0114(0030)]
However, he kept the truth alive—passed down\nfrom generation to generation as a family secret.[VAR 0114(0030)]
I see...[VAR 0114(0044)]
Kiki doesn’t know the whole story yet, does he?[VAR 0114(0044)]
He shouldn’t, no—I’ve certainly never spoken to\nhim about it. Why do you ask?[VAR 0114(0030)]
I dunno. He just really seems to like the ogre...\nHe’s practically obsessed.[VAR 0114(0044)]
And he’s been trying to one-up me—as if he\nknows more about Ogerpon than I do.[VAR 0114(0044)]
Well, I can’t say what’s going on with the boy...\nbut he always was a sensitive child. It wouldn’t\r\nsurprise me if he’s somehow intuited the truth.[VAR 0114(0030)]
I promise to tell Kieran the whole story when the\ntime is right.[VAR 0114(0030)]
Until then, take care not to breathe a word of the\ntruth to anybody![VAR 0114(0030)]
OK, Grandpa...[VAR 0114(0044)]
Now I REALLY can’t tell Kiki we met the ogre...[VAR 0114(0044)]
About that mask you showed me...I noticed the\njewel on its forehead was chipped.[VAR 0114(0030)]
I might be able to fix it. Would you mind leaving\nthe mask with me for a little while?[VAR 0114(0030)]
Oh, huh. Maybe it got chipped when it fell down\nthe stairs?[VAR 0114(0044)]
Since Grandpa’s offering, let’s get it all nice and\nfixed up before we give it back to Ogerpon![VAR 0114(0044)]
You gave the Teal Mask to Carmine’s grandfather!
Don’t you worry. I’ll be sure to take good care\nof this.[VAR 0114(0030)]
I wanna see Ogerpon again, but getting its mask\nfixed will have to come first.[VAR 0114(0044)]
For now, we should carry on with the orienteering\nbefore Kiki gets suspicious.[VAR 0114(0044)]
I bet we’ll find Kiki just killing time somewhere\nin town![VAR 0114(0044)]
The boy I partnered up with is so...ordinary.\nPretty underwhelming, if I’m being honest.[VAR 0114(0044)]
You mustn’t tell anybody about the true history\nof our village.\c\nNow, I’d better get everything ready to fix the\nogre’s mask![VAR 0114(0030)]

Oh, uh... H-hey, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0043)]
So, I...I was gonna ask. What were you and my\nsis just, uh...talkin’ about?[VAR 0114(0043)]
This and that, I guess
Nothing much...
Oh, I-I see...[VAR 0114(0043)]
S-so! About those signs! The last one’s a bit of a\nhike away.[VAR 0114(0043)]
It’s in the [VAR FF00(0006)]Paradise Barrens[VAR FF00(0000)] on the other side of\nOni Mountain.\c\nWe’ll need to head over the mountain and down\ntoward the northwest...[VAR 0114(0043)]
You go on ahead. I’ll catch up.[VAR 0114(0043)]
Why...why’d you lie to me...?[VAR 0114(0043)]
Don’t worry, I’ll do the whole orienteering thing\nlike a good li’l student. Keep a low profile, OK?[VAR 0114(0044)]
Carmine’s actually taking this orienteering thing\nseriously! FINALLY!

Ready to call it a night?
The next day...
Good morning, [VAR 0100(0000)].
Carmine wanted me to tell you that she’s waiting\nat her place. She said, “You’d better get a move\r\non—and don’t keep me waiting!”
I’m her partner, and yet you’re the one who gets\ninvited to her house... What exactly is going on\r\nwith you two, anyway?
The caretaker showed us some really cool masks\nyesterday!
You’re already done with the assignment?!\nWow, that was fast!\c\nThe girl I’m paired with is taking it slow for me—\nshe’s making sure I don’t overexert myself.
Some student pairs haven’t finished the\norienteering assignment yet.\c\nIn the meantime, why not do some exploring?\nEnjoy Kitakami to your heart’s content![VAR 0114(0042)]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Text File : sdc01_0290

[VAR BD06(0000)][VAR 0100(0000)]!\nYou\r\ntook\r\nyour\r\nsweet\r\ntime![VAR 0114(0044)]
We wanted to talk to you before Kiki wakes up.[VAR 0114(0044)]
I wanted to fix dear Ogerpon’s mask, but...[VAR 0114(0030)]
I’ll need one more material if I want to do a\nproper job of it.[VAR 0114(0030)]
Yeah...[VAR 0114(0044)]
According to Grandpa, we need to get a [VAR FF00(0006)]Crystal[VAR FF00(0000)]\n[VAR FF00(0006)]Cluster[VAR FF00(0000)] from the bottom of the Crystal Pool.[VAR 0114(0044)]
I mean, we COULD just return the mask as it is.[VAR 0114(0044)]
But I think it would make Ogerpon real happy if\nwe fixed it up first![VAR 0114(0044)]
Yeah, I bet it would!
That’s a nice thing to do
Especially now that I’ve heard the real story...\nI just want Ogerpon to be happy, you know?[VAR 0114(0044)]
I’m sure Ogerpon will be pleased to know you\ncare so much for it.[VAR 0114(0030)]
Right?[VAR 0114(0044)]
Mornin’, Grandpa.[VAR 0114(0043)]
Ah, good morning, Kieran.[VAR 0114(0030)]
Kiki! You’d better go kill time somewhere—[VAR 0114(0044)]
Yeah, yeah. Do whatever you want, Sis.[VAR 0114(0043)]
E-excuse me?! I don’t need that kinda attitude\nfrom you![VAR 0114(0044)]
I got stuff to do, OK?[VAR 0114(0043)]
What’s his problem? He’s been all bent out of\nshape since yesterday.[VAR 0114(0044)]
I don’t know... He spent the evening in his room\nwithout so much as a bite of dinner.[VAR 0114(0030)]
Must be teen angst or something. It happens![VAR 0114(0044)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]It woulda been hard to get stuff done with Kiki\nclinging to you, [VAR 0100(0000)].\r\nGuess\r\nthings\r\nworked\r\nout\r\nin\r\nour\r\nfavor![VAR 0114(0044)]
The Crystal Pool’s at the top of Oni Mountain.[VAR 0114(0044)]
I’m usually not too keen on outsiders heading\nup the mountain, but I think we can make an\r\nexception for you![VAR 0114(0044)]
What say you and I go for a hike to find\nourselves a Crystal Cluster?[VAR 0114(0044)]
The Pokémon around the Crystal Pool are strong.\nYou be careful out there.[VAR 0114(0030)]
You already found all three signs?! Me and\nCarmine only just made it to one!
Is Kieran upset about something? I said hi, but I\ndon’t think he even noticed me...
I wish I could spend all my time at the festival!\nBut I guess I need to work on the assignment...
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Text File : sdc01_0300

[VAR BD06(0000)]There you are, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nCome on,\r\nget\r\na\r\nload\r\nof\r\nthis\r\nview![VAR 0114(0044)]
This is the Crystal Pool. Bet you didn’t expect it\nto be so pretty, huh?[VAR 0114(0044)]
The crystals here are always shining. Isn’t that\nstrange? There’s even a weird rumor that you\r\ncan meet people here who’ve passed away.[VAR 0114(0044)]
Now we’ll just need to get a little bit of the\ncrystal from the bottom of the pool so we can\r\nfix the mask properly![VAR 0114(0044)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]And that’s where you come in,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]!\r\nGo on,\r\nthen!\r\nJump in!\r\nDon’t\r\nbe\r\nscared![VAR 0114(0044)]
Wait, you want ME to jump in?!
Jump in? Like, into the pool?!
Well, yeah. I can’t swim. And besides, my clothes\nwould get soaked if I did it.[VAR 0114(0044)]
You’ve got a real nifty Pokémon to ride on, right?\nYou’ll be fiiiiiine![VAR 0114(0044)]
*rumble rumble*
What in the—?! An earthquake?![VAR 0114(0044)]
Mi-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo!
Sheesh, that surprised me![VAR 0114(0044)]
Now that I think about it, Pokémon like that one\ndo show up here from time to time...[VAR 0114(0044)]
Y’know, you’re pretty handy to have around in a\nbattle, aren’t you?[VAR 0114(0044)]
Hey, is that...?[VAR 0114(0044)]
Maybe it was stuck to that Pokémon you fought?[VAR 0114(0044)]
The energy coming from those crystals at the\nbottom of the pool... I knew it![VAR 0114(0042)]
Ms. Briar![VAR 0114(0044)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Hi there, Carmine. And\n[VAR 0100(0000)],\r\ntoo!\c\nI thought you were paired with other students.\nDid you decide to switch things up?[VAR 0114(0042)]
Uh... I’m sorry, Ms. Briar, but this place is\nactually pretty special. I’m not a big fan of\r\noutsiders just wandering around up here.[VAR 0114(0044)]
I’m aware that this is sacred ground, yes.[VAR 0114(0042)]
I did get permission from the caretaker, though.\nWas that not sufficient?[VAR 0114(0042)]
...Why did you come here?[VAR 0114(0044)]
Oh, just doing a bit of field research. I was\ninterested in the properties of the water here.[VAR 0114(0042)]
And, well...my hunch was on the money![VAR 0114(0042)]
You see, the Crystal Pool’s waters emit energy\nof the same wavelength as Terastal energy.\r\nThough I have no idea why that is...[VAR 0114(0042)]
Once I figure that out, I might be able to\nstabilize the Terastal phenomenon in regions\r\nother than Paldea![VAR 0114(0042)]
Uh, I see...[VAR 0114(0044)]
Well, um... We’ve got somewhere to be, so...[VAR 0114(0044)]
Let’s head back, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0044)]
If I can just get the Terastal phenomenon to\nreliably occur in regions other than Paldea, that\r\nshould bring me one step closer to Terapagos...[VAR 0114(0042)]

Hey, Grandpa! We got the Crystal Cluster you\nneeded![VAR 0114(0044)]

Huh? Did something happen?[VAR 0114(0044)]
Kieran, he...[VAR 0114(0030)]
He ran off with the mask.[VAR 0114(0030)]
What? Why would Kiki do that?![VAR 0114(0044)]
Did you tell him about the ogre or something?![VAR 0114(0044)]
I haven’t said a word
I would never!
Right, I’m sorry... I know you wouldn’t just go\nblabbing to him like that.[VAR 0114(0044)]
Kieran seemed to be headed to Loyalty Plaza\nwith the mask.[VAR 0114(0030)]
I think...it would be best for you two to go\nafter him.[VAR 0114(0030)]
Kieran has been brooding about something for\nthe past few days.[VAR 0114(0030)]
We should head to Loyalty Plaza and figure out\nwhat’s gotten into Kieran.[VAR 0114(0044)]
Have you seen crystals like the ones in the\nCrystal Pool back home in Paldea?[VAR 0114(0042)]

[VAR 0100(0000)]...[VAR 0114(0043)]
Kiki! What in the world do you think you’re\ndoing?[VAR 0114(0044)]
You two knew, didn’t you?[VAR 0114(0043)]
You knew that the ogre wasn’t the real bad\nguy in the stories...[VAR 0114(0043)]
The Loyal Three were the real bad guys, but the\nogre’s the one that gets treated like an outcast![VAR 0114(0043)]
You...you knew?[VAR 0114(0044)]
And you two did the same thing to me![VAR 0114(0043)]
You treated ME like an outcast when you went\nan’ met with the ogre![VAR 0114(0043)]
I-I’m sorry! I didn’t mean—[VAR 0114(0044)]
You’re no different than those villagers back\nthen...[VAR 0114(0043)]
You know how much I love the ogre![VAR 0114(0043)]
You acted like you didn’t know anything, but you\nwere laughing at me behind my back all along![VAR 0114(0043)]
That’s not what happened at all![VAR 0114(0044)]
Liar! You’re a LIAR!!![VAR 0114(0043)]
What’s gotten into you, Kiki?![VAR 0114(0044)]
You’re acting real off today...[VAR 0114(0044)]
[VAR 0100(0000)]...\c\nBattle me.[VAR 0114(0043)]
If you win, I’ll give you back the mask.[VAR 0114(0043)]
So c’mon... Battle me already![VAR 0114(0043)]
OK, I will
Are you sure...?
OK... Let’s do this, then.[VAR 0114(0043)]
I...I need this battle.[VAR 0114(0043)]
Get to your position.[VAR 0114(0043)]
I’m not gonna hold anything back, you hear me![VAR 0114(0043)]
Aw...man...[VAR 0114(0043)]
Aaaagh![VAR 0114(0043)]
Owww...[VAR 0114(0043)]
Kiki, are you all right...?[VAR 0114(0044)]
Here. I promised.[VAR 0114(0043)]
Kieran returned the [VAR FF00(0008)]Teal Mask[VAR FF00(0000)] to you!
You put the Teal Mask in your Bag’s [VAR FF00(0008)]Key Items[VAR FF00(0000)]\npocket.
Say hi to the ogre for me.[VAR 0114(0043)]
Hey, listen, Kiki... I should apologize for—[VAR 0114(0044)]
I’m goin’ home.[VAR 0114(0043)]
I’m sorry about all that. He’s normally not like\nthis at all.[VAR 0114(0044)]
Do you think most people act up like that around\nKieran’s age?[VAR 0114(0044)]
The way he’s acting is a bit scary, honestly...\nIs that just me, or did you feel it too?[VAR 0114(0044)]
I don’t know...
I don’t think so
It was kinda scary...
I hope he’s OK...
Right...[VAR 0114(0044)]
I sure never let teenage angst get to my head\nlike that. I don’t know what to do with him...[VAR 0114(0044)]
*click* *clack clack clack clack*
Hey, can you hear something? ...Is it coming from\nthe Loyal Three Monument?[VAR 0114(0044)]

Huh? Huh?![VAR 0114(0044)]
What in the world?![VAR 0114(0044)]
Grrrific!

Yip-ip-ippy...
Wh-what d’you want?[VAR 0114(0044)]

What are they doing...?[VAR 0114(0044)]
Mmmkay?                                        Yip-ip-ippy...\n                           Grrrific!
Seriously, WHAT is going on?![VAR 0114(0044)]
What was that all about?[VAR 0114(0044)]
Were they the Loyal Three?
The Pokémon from the old folktale!
Hey, you’re right! There were three of ’em, and\nthey looked all sinister! That’s gotta be them![VAR 0114(0044)]
The story said they were laid to rest under the\nstatues, right?[VAR 0114(0044)]
What brought them back to life?[VAR 0114(0044)]
Wait, they ran off toward Kitakami Hall![VAR 0114(0044)]
That can’t be good! Let’s go after ’em! Come\non, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0044)]
Kieran came back not too long ago, but...I think\nyou should leave him be for now.[VAR 0114(0030)]
The Loyal Three have come back to life! How\nauspicious!
Did you see them?! The Loyal Three came here\nto Kitakami Hall!
The Loyal Three look kinda sinister, don’t they?\nThey must be what’s called antiheroes!
Ooh ooh! I locked eyes with the real Munkidori!

[VAR BD06(0000)]Ah, if it isn’t [VAR 0100(0000)]! If only you’d\nbeen\r\nhere\r\na few\r\nminutes\r\nearlier![VAR 0114(0045)]
Hey, did those lousy three Pokémon come here?![VAR 0114(0044)]
I believe you mean the LOYAL Three, Carmine.[VAR 0114(0045)]
Forget about that silly title![VAR 0114(0044)]
Always with your attitude...[VAR 0114(0045)]
But yes, you did miss out on an incredible treat!\c\nThe Loyal Three were just visiting our humble\nlittle hall![VAR 0114(0045)]
It seemed they wished to collect the shining\nmasks we’ve kept safe here at Kitakami Hall...[VAR 0114(0045)]
so naturally we representatives of the hall were\nhappy to return the masks to them with all haste![VAR 0114(0045)]
You gave them the masks?![VAR 0114(0044)]
And we offered them a platter of our special\nKitakami Mochi, packed full of our best herbs!\r\nThe Loyal Three gobbled them up in a flash![VAR 0114(0045)]
And you FED them?![VAR 0114(0044)]
Kitakami Mochi are full of nutrition! The Loyal\nThree are bigger and stronger now, I’m sure!
But those lousy three are the bad guys! The masks\nbelong to Ogerpon!\c\nUgh, I really wish I could tell them everything...[VAR 0114(0044)]
So, where did those three go?[VAR 0114(0044)]
They went at once to ascend Oni Mountain![VAR 0114(0045)]
Perhaps they have it in mind to finish off the\nterrible ogre that lurks in the Dreaded Den.[VAR 0114(0045)]
No wonder they were dubbed the Loyal Three!\nSuch hardworking heroes they are! Hahaha!
This isn’t the time to be laughing at all![VAR 0114(0044)]
If the story we heard is true, then those three\nmust’ve gone to get revenge on Ogerpon.[VAR 0114(0044)]
They say the ogre fought using the powers of its\nmasks.[VAR 0114(0044)]
But Ogerpon doesn’t have any masks right now,\nright?! It won’t stand a chance![VAR 0114(0044)]
We should help it!
Let’s return its mask!
Yeah, we’re on the same page! But we should\nsplit up![VAR 0114(0044)]
You head to the Dreaded Den and help\nOgerpon![VAR 0114(0044)]
I’ll go back home to get the mask fixed up! Give\nme the mask and the crystal![VAR 0114(0044)]
You gave Carmine the Teal Mask and the Crystal\nCluster.
Thanks![VAR 0114(0044)]
I’ll head your way the moment the mask’s fixed!\nUntil then, make sure Ogerpon’s safe![VAR 0114(0044)]
The Loyal Three were headed up Oni Mountain\nwhen we last saw them.[VAR 0114(0045)]

Mmm-kiii!

Mm-kay! Mm-kay!
		Grrrif!\n				 Yip-ippy!
Knock it off, all of you![VAR 0114(0044)]
They were trying to go three against one on you,\nhuh? I guess a fair fight’s too much to expect![VAR 0114(0044)]
But now that we’re here...[VAR 0114(0044)]
We’ll make you regret ever coming back to life![VAR 0114(0044)]
Mmm-ki-ki...
Ah—they ran away![VAR 0114(0043)]
Hmph! I guess I’m just too much for them to\nhandle![VAR 0114(0044)]
[VAR 0100(0000)]... I... Uh...[VAR 0114(0043)]
Go on, say it properly![VAR 0114(0044)]
A-about the mask. I just got so angry, and...[VAR 0114(0043)]
What I did was real dumb...[VAR 0114(0043)]
So... I’m sorry.[VAR 0114(0043)]
Don’t mention it!
I’m sorry too
Thanks, [VAR 0100(0000)]...[VAR 0114(0043)]
He was sulkin’ around, so I grabbed him by the\ncollar and dragged him here![VAR 0114(0044)]
And, well...I’m glad I did![VAR 0114(0044)]
Pon pon.
It’s really you... The real-life ogre...[VAR 0114(0043)]
Wowzers... You’re really something![VAR 0114(0043)]
You wanted to be the one to give the mask back\nto Ogerpon, right, Kiki?[VAR 0114(0044)]
This is...for you, dear ogre.[VAR 0114(0043)]
Gah... Grrr...
It seems scared... Maybe it’s not good with new\npeople, Kiki.[VAR 0114(0044)]
... ... ...[VAR 0114(0043)]
I don’t think it’ll take the mask if I’m the one\ngiving it back. You should be the one to do it,\r\n[VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0043)]
You returned the Teal Mask to Ogerpon!
Pon! Pon-yo!
Hee hee, it seems so happy![VAR 0114(0044)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]It seems pretty comfortable around you,\n[VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0044)]
... ... ...[VAR 0114(0043)]
It’d be nice if we could give the other three\nmasks back to Ogerpon too, don’t you think?[VAR 0114(0044)]
Did those... Did those three Pokémon take the\nmasks that were in Kitakami Hall?[VAR 0114(0043)]
Yeah! Never mind that the masks rightfully belong\nto poor Ogerpon here![VAR 0114(0044)]
I wouldn’t put it past the so-called Loyal Three\nto plot a second ambush, either. We need to\r\nkeep Ogerpon safe while we deal with them![VAR 0114(0044)]
That means the three of us are gonna form a\nteam—the Mask Retrieval Squad![VAR 0114(0044)]
Count me in!
Are you serious?
Good idea, isn’t it? And you get to be my\nsecond-in-command![VAR 0114(0044)]
You got a problem with the name? Think carefully\nor I may demote you from second-in-command![VAR 0114(0044)]
I can come too?[VAR 0114(0043)]
Of course you can!\c\nAnd now that that’s settled, let’s go gather\nintel about those “Loyal” Three in Mossui![VAR 0114(0044)]
We’re gonna get those masks back![VAR 0114(0044)]
We can do this!
Ogerpon will now follow you around!
With the Loyal Three walking among us again,\nthis might be a good chance to capitalize on\r\nsome new merch and souvenirs for the town![VAR 0114(0045)]

Gah... Grah...
What’s wrong, Ogerpon?[VAR 0114(0044)]
I bet it doesn’t wanna go into the village.[VAR 0114(0043)]
The villagers did a pretty good job of chasin’ it\naway back then, so...[VAR 0114(0043)]
Yeah, you’re right...[VAR 0114(0044)]
OK, well, maybe Ogerpon can wait for us here.[VAR 0114(0044)]
We can go gather information while it waits.[VAR 0114(0044)]
D-do you think it’ll be OK?[VAR 0114(0043)]
Pay attention now, Ogerpon...[VAR 0114(0044)]
We go in village! You stay here! Ogerpon stay!\nDo you understand?[VAR 0114(0044)]
Po...?
...I’m gonna take that as a no.[VAR 0114(0044)]
Wait for us here till we come back, OK?
Be good and stay out of trouble, all right?
Poniii!
Looks like it understood that![VAR 0114(0043)]
What was wrong with what I said?![VAR 0114(0044)]

I saw Fezandipiti zoom through the sky over\nOni Mountain!\c\nIt was so much cooler than the stories say!
Have you seen Okidogi of the Loyal Three?\nThat purple scarf it wears is so lovely!\c\nI saw it wandering around in the barrens!
I thought someone had collapsed, so I went to\ncheck on them, but it was just Munkidori taking\r\na nap! It can be so peaceful around that pond\r\nout there. What an ideal place for a snooze!
You got a clue to the Loyal Three’s whereabouts!
You got a second clue to the Loyal Three’s\nwhereabouts!
You got clues to all of the Loyal Three’s\nwhereabouts! Time to compare notes!
We need to gather every scrap of info we can\nget about any sightings of the Lousy Three!\r\nLet’s meet up once we’re done![VAR 0114(0044)]
I-I’m not big on goin’ up and just talkin’ to\npeople, even if we’re all from the same village...[VAR 0114(0043)]

We’re back, Ogerpon![VAR 0114(0044)]
... ... ...[VAR 0114(0043)]
All right! Let’s combine the info we’ve gathered![VAR 0114(0044)]
You go first, Kiki![VAR 0114(0044)]
OK, well, here’s what I heard...[VAR 0114(0043)]
Hmm, I see. Interesting...[VAR 0114(0044)]
Thanks to the information you two brought,\nI think we know exactly where each of those\r\nLousy Three is hiding![VAR 0114(0044)]
That’s great news!
What’d you learn, Carmine?
I knew the Mask Retrieval Squad I assembled\nwouldn’t let me down![VAR 0114(0044)]
Rest assured, your fearless leader—that’s\nme—sees your hard work and effort![VAR 0114(0044)]
Look, I’m the leader here. Mundane work like\ngathering info just doesn’t suit me.[VAR 0114(0044)]
Besides, I tried talking to a few people here and\nthere, but they got all nervous and stuff!\c\nI’m just too pretty for my own good.[VAR 0114(0044)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]I’ll record everything we found out about those\nthree to your Rotom Phone,\r\n[VAR 0100(0000)].\r\nThat way\r\nwe\r\nwon’t\r\nforget\r\nany\r\nof it![VAR 0114(0044)]
Now then, let’s go retrieve those masks![VAR 0114(0044)]
We can do this![VAR 0114(0044)]
I’m...I’m not goin’.[VAR 0114(0043)]
What? You’re part of the team! You need to\ncome along![VAR 0114(0044)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]As long as [VAR 0100(0000)]’s around,\nI’m\r\nsure\r\nOgerpon\r\nwill\r\nfeel\r\nsafe...[VAR 0114(0043)]
’Sides, I got things to do...[VAR 0114(0043)]
Sorry![VAR 0114(0043)]
Huh. I wonder if he’s still upset?[VAR 0114(0044)]
Oh well! I can’t force him to tag along. Let’s just\ntake care of this ourselves![VAR 0114(0044)]
You can decide where we head first![VAR 0114(0044)]
Let’s get all of Ogerpon’s masks back, all right?[VAR 0114(0044)]
Pon-yo-pon!

We did it! We got the first mask back![VAR 0114(0044)]
Pon-yooo!
Heehee... It sure is happy![VAR 0114(0044)]
You know, I felt this way at the Crystal Pool too,\nbut we make a good team, don’t we?[VAR 0114(0044)]
Two masks left! Let’s take the rest of the Loyal\nThree down![VAR 0114(0044)]

That makes two masks back where they belong![VAR 0114(0044)]
Pon-yooo!
We did it, Ogerpon![VAR 0114(0044)]
No opponent’s gonna give us any trouble so long\nas we’re a team![VAR 0114(0044)]
Kiki really shoulda come with us...[VAR 0114(0044)]
Well, one more mask remaining! Let’s make this\nLoyal One a Loyal None![VAR 0114(0044)]

We’re like the ogre and its masks—we help bring\nout each other’s full power![VAR 0114(0044)]
And there it is! We got the last mask![VAR 0114(0044)]
Pon-yooo!
Congratulations, Ogerpon! And good work,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]! We’ve got all the masks![VAR 0114(0044)]
Pon-yooo!
Thank goodness... It all worked out—right,\nOgerpon?[VAR 0114(0044)]
[VAR 0100(0000)]! Sis![VAR 0114(0043)]
Huh? Kiki? What’s up?[VAR 0114(0044)]
Well, uh...I...I wanted to ask a favor...[VAR 0114(0043)]
I wanted you to come to the village. An’ bring\nthe ogre with you...[VAR 0114(0043)]
But the villagers...
Are you sure it’s safe?
You gotta trust me. It’ll be OK. I promise...[VAR 0114(0043)]
Th-that’s all I wanted to ask! Just come![VAR 0114(0043)]
I wonder what’s gotten into him. Everyone in the\nvillage thinks that Ogerpon’s a menace, right?\r\nI hope he knows what he’s doing...[VAR 0114(0044)]
Pon...?
But he did have a confident look in his eyes![VAR 0114(0044)]
Let’s trust Kiki and head to the village.[VAR 0114(0044)]
If things go south, I’ll use my natural charm to\nsmooth things over![VAR 0114(0044)]

D-don’t worry! It’ll be fine![VAR 0114(0043)]
Kiki! What’s this all about, really?[VAR 0114(0044)]
I-I know you must be scared, Ogerpon, but I\ndid my best...[VAR 0114(0043)]
So...just trust me and come with me, OK?[VAR 0114(0043)]
So that’s the ogre, Ogerpon...
It’s actually real?!
Gah... Grah...
Don’t worry
Let’s trust Kieran
So this is the ogre of Oni Mountain...[VAR 0114(0045)]
This is the true face of Ogerpon, whom we’ve so\nsorely wronged![VAR 0114(0045)]
For far too long, we’ve told tales casting you as\nthe villain here in Kitakami...[VAR 0114(0045)]
We all owe you a great apology.[VAR 0114(0045)]
Poni?!
Hey, what’s going on?! Why the sudden\nabout-face?![VAR 0114(0044)]
Kieran’s been running around the whole village,\ntelling everyone the true story of what happened.[VAR 0114(0030)]
I was worried he’d stir up a lot of resentment,\nso I told him to stop, but...[VAR 0114(0030)]
We’re so sorry, dear ogre!
Ogerpon’s so cute!
Seems that I was wrong to worry so much.[VAR 0114(0030)]
Who knew Kiki had it in him! Especially since he\nusually hates talking to people![VAR 0114(0044)]
From now on, you can come to the village\nwhenever you want...[VAR 0114(0043)]
and you don’t need to hide your face when\nyou do![VAR 0114(0043)]
Pon-yo!
The three masks we kept at Kitakami Hall\nrightfully belonged to you all along.[VAR 0114(0045)]
If you’ve managed to get them back from those\nthree villains, please feel welcome to keep them.[VAR 0114(0045)]
We got the masks back, and we managed to\nclear Ogerpon’s name![VAR 0114(0044)]
Now that’s what I call a happy ending![VAR 0114(0044)]
One last thing to do—let’s escort Ogerpon back\nto its home![VAR 0114(0044)]
We truly wronged Ogerpon...\c\nFrom now on, we’ll be sure to pass down the true\nversion of events in our town.[VAR 0114(0045)]

Bye-bye, Ogerpon!
Take care—OK, Ogerpon?
Po?
Ponooo!
Hey, you know what?[VAR 0114(0044)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]I think Ogerpon might want to go with you,\n[VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0044)]

Hey, hold up![VAR 0114(0043)]
If it’s not gonna stay here, then I...I wanna...[VAR 0114(0043)]
I want Ogerpon to come with me![VAR 0114(0043)]
Kiki...[VAR 0114(0044)]
I know I’m bein’ real selfish...[VAR 0114(0043)]
But, [VAR 0100(0000)]! Please![VAR 0114(0043)]
Let me battle you! I want to see which one of us\nshould get to keep Ogerpon with them![VAR 0114(0043)]
Hey, Kiki...[VAR 0114(0044)]
I know you really love Ogerpon. I really, honestly\nunderstand.[VAR 0114(0044)]
But...you have to think about Ogerpon’s\nfeelings too.[VAR 0114(0044)]
Pon?
...I want to battle anyway.[VAR 0114(0043)]
So let me know once you’re ready.[VAR 0114(0043)]

Well then, let’s get started...[VAR 0114(0043)]
Whoever wins gets to be Ogerpon’s partner...[VAR 0114(0043)]
So don’t...don’t you dare hold back![VAR 0114(0043)]

But I just couldn’t give up...[VAR 0114(0043)]
I’m sorry...[VAR 0114(0043)]
Oh, Kiki...[VAR 0114(0044)]
Pon?
[VAR BD06(0000)]I think it’s time for you to catch Ogerpon,\n[VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0044)]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Text File : sdc01_0460
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
It seems Ogerpon wants to test its strength\nagainst you!
Do you want to battle Ogerpon so that you can\ncatch it?
Pon-yooo!
Ogerpon entrusted you with the [VAR FF00(0008)]Cornerstone[VAR FF00(0000)]\n[VAR FF00(0008)]Mask[VAR FF00(0000)], [VAR FF00(0008)]Wellspring Mask[VAR FF00(0000)], and [VAR FF00(0008)]Hearthflame Mask[VAR FF00(0000)]!
You put the masks in your Bag’s [VAR FF00(0008)]Other Items[VAR FF00(0000)]\npocket.
[VAR BD06(0000)]Hey, well done, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nThat\r\nwas\r\npretty\r\nimpressive![VAR 0114(0044)]
Con...congratulations...[VAR 0114(0043)]
Thanks, Kieran
I’ll take good care of it
Yeah...[VAR 0114(0043)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Why...why can’t I be like you,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0043)]
Uwaaaaaaaaah![VAR 0114(0043)]
Ugh. I hate when he gets like that...[VAR 0114(0044)]
Don’t worry ’bout him.[VAR 0114(0044)]
He’s the one who said the winner gets to become\nOgerpon’s partner.[VAR 0114(0044)]

The next day...
Hey, [VAR 0100(0000)]. Good morning.
I’ve got a message from Carmine. She says she’s\nwaiting for you at Loyalty Plaza and that you\r\nshould hurry up and meet her there.
Say, why do you two always use me as your\nmessenger boy, huh?!

There you are! You took your time![VAR 0114(0044)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]You really battled great yesterday,\n[VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0044)]
I guess the Mask Retrieval Squad has completed\nits mission.[VAR 0114(0044)]
Though Kiki...\c\nWell, he’s shut himself in his room ever since he\ngot home yesterday.[VAR 0114(0044)]
That’s worrying...
He won’t come out?
Yeah...[VAR 0114(0044)]
Oh, but you don’t need to feel guilty or anything,\n[VAR 0100(0000)].\c\nIt all started ’cause I said we should keep the\nwhole Ogerpon thing a secret...[VAR 0114(0044)]
And you wouldn’t think it, but...Kiki’s got a bit\nof an ego too! He doesn’t take losing well.[VAR 0114(0044)]
Anyway, how’s Ogerpon doing?[VAR 0114(0044)]
I’ll be honest, I’ve grown real fond of Ogerpon\nmyself! Guess Kiki’s rubbed off on me a bit.[VAR 0114(0044)]
Do you think you could let me have a battle\nwith Ogerpon?[VAR 0114(0044)]
You’re not still angry about me giving you a\nhard time when you first got here, are you?\r\nC’mon, I just wanna make some memories![VAR 0114(0044)]
I knew you’d say yes! You’re not one to turn down\na good battle. Let me know when you’re ready![VAR 0114(0044)]
I see you’ve got Ogerpon on your team! I think\nits battle style changes depending on its mask,\r\nso is it all set and ready to go?[VAR 0114(0044)]
Hey, you gotta have Ogerpon on your team!\nTalk to me once you’ve got it, OK?[VAR 0114(0044)]
Ogerpon isn’t in your team OR in your Boxes?\nOh well... Do you still wanna battle?[VAR 0114(0044)]
Come talk to me when you’re ready to say yes.[VAR 0114(0044)]
Right. Let’s get to our positions.[VAR 0114(0044)]
Aaagh, I lost! But I’m also not surprised![VAR 0114(0044)]
You and Ogerpon really do get along, don’t you?\nIt’s almost making me jealous.[VAR 0114(0044)]
I wanted to see what Ogerpon could do in battle,\nbut oh well...[VAR 0114(0044)]
Pon pon!

Ah, yes. Thank you for coming.[VAR 0114(0045)]
I’ve been told that our student pairs have now\nfinished visiting all the signboards in Kitakami...\r\nwhich means your self-guided tour is at an end![VAR 0114(0045)]
Hear that? We did it! We found ’em all!
That was so much fun!
Why, thank you for saying so! And thanks for\ntaking part![VAR 0114(0045)]
On that note, I’ve got a little gift for each of you.[VAR 0114(0045)]
You received the [VAR FF00(0008)]Kitakami Mochi Set[VAR FF00(0000)] from the\ncaretaker!
You put the Kitakami Mochi Set in your Bag’s\n[VAR FF00(0008)]Other Items[VAR FF00(0000)] pocket.
Truth be told, I didn’t think you’d wrap up the\ntour this quickly. You’re quite the prodigies![VAR 0114(0045)]
Our visitors from Paldea still have heaps of time\nleft to enjoy Kitakami and all it has to offer.[VAR 0114(0045)]
Continue to make yourselves at home and\nexplore as you please.[VAR 0114(0045)]
However...[VAR 0114(0045)]
I’m sorry for suddenly springing this on you, but\nCarmine, Kieran, and I will need to return to\r\nBlueberry Academy a little early.[VAR 0114(0042)]
Oh no!
But why?
Again, truly sorry, but there have been some\ndevelopments concerning the Great Crater.\c\nI’m afraid we really must be heading back.[VAR 0114(0042)]
I realize I was here as your chaperone, but you\nkids have all proven to be very capable.\c\nI’m sure you’ll be fine without me.[VAR 0114(0042)]
Thank you so much for looking after them in\nmy stead.[VAR 0114(0042)]
Don’t mention it. You can leave these kids to me![VAR 0114(0045)]
Now then... Carmine, I believe you had\nsomething you wanted to say?[VAR 0114(0042)]
Yes...[VAR 0114(0044)]
Unfortunately my brother’s not feeling well, so\nit’s just me here to speak...[VAR 0114(0044)]
Anyway, as you all know, this village is where I\nwas born.[VAR 0114(0044)]
And I’ll be honest—I didn’t want any outsiders\ncoming here at all![VAR 0114(0044)]
Yikes...
It felt like our home was being turned into a\ntourist trap for a buncha ignorant strangers...[VAR 0114(0044)]
But then we spent some time together, and none\nof you were the way I imagined you’d be at all...[VAR 0114(0044)]

Especially you, [VAR 0100(0000)]...[VAR 0114(0044)]
I’m glad you came to visit.[VAR 0114(0044)]
I mean, it’s not like this is good-bye forever...[VAR 0114(0044)]
Blueberry Academy has tons of strong Trainers!\nYou’d better come visit soon![VAR 0114(0044)]
Oh, I almost forgot—I still need to get packed\nand everything![VAR 0114(0044)]
This is NOT good-bye, OK? We’re definitely\ngonna see each other again![VAR 0114(0044)]
That’s Carmine for you, I suppose... You never\nknow quite what to expect from her.[VAR 0114(0045)]
Each moment spent with you kids is just dazzling.\nFor an adult like me? Heh... It’s almost blinding.[VAR 0114(0042)]

This is actually just the entrance—the school itself\nis mostly underwater! Isn’t that amazing?[VAR 0114(004B)]
Oh—and did you notice?[VAR 0114(004B)]
Look at how blue the place is! I can’t tell you how\nlong I spent picking the perfect blueberry color![VAR 0114(004B)]
Let’s see... What else?[VAR 0114(004B)]
Uh...perhaps you have something you’d like to\nask me?[VAR 0114(004B)]
Why’s the rest of the school underwater?
Why did you pick “blueberry” for the name?
How do you know Director Clavell?
Really? That’s what you’re curious about?[VAR 0114(004B)]
Well, it’s very simple. You see, it’s...uh...[VAR 0114(004B)]
It’s because the school building is attached to an\nundersea plant that develops natural resources.\r\nRight? That’s what I’ve heard![VAR 0114(002C)]
It’s because, in the language of flowers, the\nblueberry is said to represent a fruitful life.\r\nI think that’s where it came from, right?[VAR 0114(002C)]
Director Cyrano and Director Clavell got to know\neach other through their postgraduate work at\r\nthe same university.\c\nOr at least that’s what I’ve heard![VAR 0114(002C)]
Yes! Right! Exactly! Took the words right out of\nmy mouth.[VAR 0114(004B)]
Always on point, aren’t you, Lacey?[VAR 0114(004B)]
Oh, no, it was nothing...[VAR 0114(0049)]

I suppose I didn’t introduce myself, did I?\nI’m Lacey—one of the second-year students here![VAR 0114(0049)]
You must really be something special, you know.\c\nIt’s rare for Director Cyrano to remember the\nname of a new student.[VAR 0114(0049)]
Hah! Just call me out, why don’t you![VAR 0114(004B)]
Actually, I’ve got an idea! Why don’t YOU explain\nhow things work around here, Lacey?[VAR 0114(004B)]
You...you want ME to do it?![VAR 0114(0049)]
Well, yeah. You know this tour-guide stuff isn’t\nmy strong suit![VAR 0114(004B)]
Well, that’s certainly true... But still, I imagine\nthere must be someone more suitable than me.[VAR 0114(0049)]
Oh! Please, don’t take it like— It’s not that I\ndon’t want to show you around or anything![VAR 0114(0049)]
Director Cyrano just has this bad habit of pushing\nhis duties onto me, you see.[VAR 0114(0049)]
And it’s just not right![VAR 0114(0049)]
Really letting me have it today, aren’t you?[VAR 0114(004B)]
That said...this might be my chance to get to\nknow the new student everyone’s talking about\r\nbefore anyone else can...[VAR 0114(0049)]
That decides it! I will take on this task![VAR 0114(0049)]
Excellent![VAR 0114(004B)]
Now then, let’s head straight down this bridge\nand to the entrance! On you go![VAR 0114(0049)]
You can get a gorgeous view of the sunset from\nthis walkway, you know![VAR 0114(004B)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Just head straight to the entrance,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0049)]

This is the entrance to Blueberry Academy.[VAR 0114(0049)]
Our school puts a great deal of emphasis on the\nart of Pokémon battling.[VAR 0114(0049)]
We hold official matches on this central court\nright here at the entrance—and any student can\r\nfreely utilize this court if it’s not otherwise in use.[VAR 0114(0049)]
I think it’s safe to say that you’ll be battling more\nhere than in any other school![VAR 0114(0049)]
Exactly! Couldn’t have said it better myself![VAR 0114(004B)]
Director Cyrano... I think perhaps it’s fine if you\njust leave the tour to me.[VAR 0114(0049)]
Still...it’s really relaxing here, with the sea breeze\nblowing over you. Even when no one is battling,\r\nyou often see students lazing about in the stands.[VAR 0114(0049)]
Oh, oh, oh! And there’s one other quality of our\nschool that you’ll likely find very surprising![VAR 0114(0049)]
Wild Pokémon sometimes Terastallize here![VAR 0114(0049)]
Really!
Yeah...?
Oh. I suppose that’s not anything special to\nsomeone from Paldea, is it?[VAR 0114(0049)]
The Terastal phenomenon was first discovered\nin the Paldea region, after all.[VAR 0114(004B)]
But we’ve taken things a step further than you\nand your Tera Orbs.\c\nWe’ve developed some neat tech ourselves—\nsomething that lets us control the Terastal\r\nphenomenon on our own turf![VAR 0114(004B)]
I bet that piques your interest, doesn’t it?[VAR 0114(004B)]
Um, sir, I think it will be easier to understand\nhow all that works after we go to the lower level.\r\nIf you could put a little pin in that thought?[VAR 0114(0049)]
Always thinking ahead—that’s our Lacey![VAR 0114(004B)]
Oh! You know what? I think it’d be great if the\ntwo of you had a battle![VAR 0114(004B)]
Wha—?! Right now?![VAR 0114(0049)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Why not? I’d like to see what\n[VAR 0100(0000)]\r\nhere\r\nis\r\ncapable\r\nof.[VAR 0114(004B)]
And our Lacey is a member of the Elite Four in\nthe League Club we have going here.\c\nTo say nothing of the influence of her father—\none of the Unova region’s famed Gym Leaders!\r\nI bet you’ll learn a thing or two![VAR 0114(004B)]
Oh, I wish you wouldn’t go spreading personal\ninformation without asking first![VAR 0114(0049)]
It’s just not right![VAR 0114(0049)]
Give me a good show now, you two![VAR 0114(004B)]
I’m sorry, but...there’s no negotiating with\nDirector Cyrano once he gets an idea in his head.\c\nThere’s no way that he’ll move on with the tour\nuntil we’ve given him his battle.[VAR 0114(0049)]
Besides, I have to admit I’m a little excited\nmyself at the chance to battle you![VAR 0114(0049)]
Here at Blueberry Academy, we tend to go for\nDouble Battles.\c\nLet’s give one a try to get to know each other\na little better![VAR 0114(0049)]
Spectacular! You really are quite skilled.\c\nAnd the way you Terastallized your Pokémon—\nI can see that living in the home of the Terastal\r\nphenomenon taught you much.[VAR 0114(0049)]
Spectacular! You really are quite skilled.\c\nI wish I could have seen you Terastallize one\nof your Pokémon, though. I’d love to see how\r\nsomeone from Paldea does it![VAR 0114(0049)]
I’m relieved I could pull out a win... It was a\npositively white-hot battle, after all![VAR 0114(0049)]
The students here at Blueberry Academy were\nonly recently issued Tera Orbs, so I hope you’ll\r\nbe able to teach us more about them.[VAR 0114(0049)]
Well done to the both of you! You really battled\nit out Blueberry-style.[VAR 0114(004B)]
Speaking of style...\c\nI forgot I had a uniform for you! You’ll feel like\nyou fit right in as soon as you’re dressing the part![VAR 0114(004B)]
It suits you beautifully![VAR 0114(0049)]
Now that’s what I call fashion! Oh, and you can\ntake this as well.[VAR 0114(004B)]
That should give you a few more options when\nyou visit shops and salons and such in Paldea![VAR 0114(004B)]
Now that you look the part—and hopefully feel\nit too—why don’t we head into the school?[VAR 0114(0049)]
You can pick where you want to go from the\ngates over there.[VAR 0114(0049)]
Come on! I can show you the pride of Blueberry\nAcademy: our world-famous [VAR FF00(0006)]Terarium[VAR FF00(0000)]![VAR 0114(0049)]
We should visit the [VAR FF00(0006)]Terarium [VAR FF00(0000)]next! Just select\nit at the gate, and we’ll be off.[VAR 0114(0049)]
You’re a strong one. Excadrill is a lot speedier\nthan it looks, but you handled yourself well![VAR 0114(004B)]

This is it. The park beneath the sea that has\ngained renown around the world...[VAR 0114(0049)]
Our very own [VAR FF00(0006)]Terarium[VAR FF00(0000)]![VAR 0114(0049)]
We may be underwater, but the projectors built\ninto the walls and ceiling make it feel like we’re\r\nactually outside, don’t they?[VAR 0114(0049)]
We’ve been able to create a comfortable\nenvironment for Pokémon through technology![VAR 0114(0049)]
I designed all this myself! And believe me—it\nwasn’t cheap.[VAR 0114(004B)]
Within this dome, there are four distinct biomes.[VAR 0114(0049)]
Here we have the nice and toasty subtropical\nSavanna Biome.[VAR 0114(0049)]
Then, off to your right, you can see the breezy,\ntropical Coastal Biome.[VAR 0114(0049)]
Further out to your left, you’ll see the craggy,\ncrunchy, rugged Canyon Biome.[VAR 0114(0049)]
Last but not least, waaay out in the distance, we\nhave the arctic and snowy Polar Biome![VAR 0114(0049)]
Each biome’s air temperature and humidity levels\nare regulated with the utmost care.[VAR 0114(0049)]
That’s why you can find completely different\nPokémon species living in each area![VAR 0114(0049)]
We sure put a lot of effort into it![VAR 0114(004B)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Tell me, [VAR 0100(0000)], which biome\ntickles\r\nyour\r\nfancy\r\noff\r\nthe bat?[VAR 0114(0049)]
The subtropical Savanna Biome
The tropical Coastal Biome
The craggy Canyon Biome
The snowy Polar Biome
It’s a very familiar sort of environment, isn’t it?\c\nThe open stretches of land make it very easy to\nobserve how the Pokémon are living.[VAR 0114(0049)]
Goodness, really? It seems you and I will get\nalong just great, then—that’s my favorite, too!\r\nThe breezy atmosphere is just so calming![VAR 0114(0049)]
Oh, so you like things that are a bit rough and\nrugged, do you?\c\nYou can also find a mysterious ore in that biome\nthat we call “chargestone”![VAR 0114(0049)]
Oh, so you like it cold, do you?\c\nI’m not very good with the cold myself, but Ice-\ntype Pokémon can be awfully cute![VAR 0114(0049)]
If you need to heal up your team while you’re\ndown here, feel free to use the [VAR FF00(0006)]self-serve healing[VAR FF00(0000)]\r\n[VAR FF00(0006)]machines[VAR FF00(0000)] we’ve installed around the Terarium.[VAR 0114(0049)]
Now then. Director Cyrano...[VAR 0114(0049)]
Can you explain to us why crystals form here, and\nhow the wild Pokémon are able to Terastallize?[VAR 0114(0049)]
I—huh? But don’t you know already, Lacey, that...\nOooh, I get it! You want me to do the talking.[VAR 0114(004B)]
In that case, let me show you—the reason is\nactually right above our heads![VAR 0114(004B)]
That there is the [VAR FF00(0006)]Terarium Core[VAR FF00(0000)], which presides\nover all that happens in the Terarium.[VAR 0114(004B)]
It contains a fluid that we’ve jam-packed full of\na special material from Paldea.[VAR 0114(004B)]
It’s constantly emitting Terastal energy—that’s\nwhat allows Pokémon to Terastallize in the dome![VAR 0114(004B)]
Wonderful! Well said, sir! That’s exactly right![VAR 0114(0049)]
Though...I still don’t know what that “special\nmaterial” is, within the Terarium Core itself.\r\nIt’s never been shared publicly, has it?[VAR 0114(0049)]
Ohoho, you want to know? Well, in fact, it’s...\c\nIt’s...[VAR 0114(004B)]
Now what was it? I’ve plumb forgotten.[VAR 0114(004B)]
Briar put all of it together, so I’m not certain\nmyself.[VAR 0114(004B)]
That’s...what I thought you might say.[VAR 0114(0049)]
*bing-bong-bong-bing* ♪
Practical battle class will commence shortly in\nthe Coastal Biome.
Students participating in this class should make\ntheir way to the Coastal Biome now.
*bong-bing-bing-bong* ♪
Oh! It looks like you’re just in time to see a class\nsession too![VAR 0114(0049)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]This is too good of a chance to pass up. Won’t\nyou join us, [VAR 0100(0000)]?\r\nYou\r\ncan\r\nget\r\nyour\r\nfirst\r\ntaste\r\nof\r\nour\r\nschool’s\r\nclasses.[VAR 0114(0049)]
Teehee! I do love to see that sort of passion for\neducation![VAR 0114(0049)]
B-but it’s such a great opportunity to learn!\nYou can’t tell me you don’t like studying![VAR 0114(0049)]
I’ll go ahead and register the Terarium map to\nyour Rotom Phone for you.[VAR 0114(0049)]
The [VAR FF00(0006)]Terarium map [VAR FF00(0000)]has been added to your\nmap app!
It’s fun to take a stroll through the Terarium on\nyour own, and I think I’d be more of a hassle\r\nthan anything if you had me holding your hand...[VAR 0114(0049)]
So, yup, that settles it! Please find your way to\nthe class site in the Coastal Biome on your own![VAR 0114(0049)]
Well, doesn’t seem like I’m needed here.[VAR 0114(004B)]
Wait, sir, you don’t—[VAR 0114(0049)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]But I’ve made sure that a dorm room has been\nall set up for you,\r\n[VAR 0100(0000)],\r\nso\r\ndon’t\r\nforget\r\nto\r\ngive\r\nit\r\na\r\nvisit\r\nlater![VAR 0114(004B)]
Oh yes, and one other thing: Could you open\nyour Pokédex app for me?[VAR 0114(004B)]
The [VAR FF00(0006)]Blueberry Pokédex[VAR FF00(0000)] has been added to\nyour Pokédex app!
Catch as many Pokémon here in the Terarium as\nyou please—don’t be afraid to go Sawsbuck-wild![VAR 0114(004B)]
It’s your student life here at Blueberry Academy,\nso remember to live it up to the fullest![VAR 0114(004B)]
And there he goes...[VAR 0114(0049)]
Well, you can at least count on me to be around\nwhen you need me, so there’s no call for concern![VAR 0114(0049)]
It’s probably time we both head to class! I’ll be\nwaiting for you to join us in the Coastal Biome![VAR 0114(0049)]

Oh! [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0049)]
*whisper whisper*\nYou didn’t have any trouble finding the place?[VAR 0114(0049)]
It was fine!
*whisper whisper*
*whisper whisper*\nI’m so glad to hear it![VAR 0114(0049)]
*whisper whisper*\nSay again? I didn’t quite catch that![VAR 0114(0049)]
Alola, everybody! Shall we get started?
Looks like we have a new face here with us\ntoday!
I’m sure you’re all enjoying the tropical clime\nwe’ve re-created here at the Coastal Biome.
But remember—it’s really for the many Pokémon\nyou’ll find living here, adapted for such weather!
One such species has even grown exceptionally\nlarger than it might in other regions, thanks to all\r\nthe light it’s exposed to here!
That’s right, certain species of Pokémon can have\ncompletely different appearances depending on\r\nthe region! We call this variation a [VAR FF00(0006)]regional form[VAR FF00(0000)].
And that brings us to today’s task.\c\nI’d like each of you to catch one of these\nPokémon—specifically, an [VAR FF00(0006)]Alolan Form[VAR FF00(0000)] Pokémon!
When you’ve got one, come and report to me.
Now, get catching!
Many of our classes here at Blueberry Academy\nare practical ones like this.[VAR 0114(0049)]
So off you go! Don’t overthink it and just do your\nbest for this first class![VAR 0114(0049)]
Do you know what kind of Pokémon it is you’re\nsupposed to be looking for?\c\nI suppose the best-known Alolan form might be\nAlolan Exeggutor, with its long, long neck![VAR 0114(0049)]
Do you know about the Dugtrio in Alola?\nThey’ve got these, like, crazy whiskers?!\r\nFeels weird to call them that, though.
In the tropical Alola region, it’s quite common\nto greet people by calling out “Alola!”
Now, which Pokémon had Alolan forms...? I think\nI remember a couple...
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Text File : sdc02_0080
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Did you manage to catch an Alolan Form\nPokémon for me?
Keep searching and I’m sure you’ll find one.\nJust imagine you’re out on a nice stroll in Alola!
Ahhh, regrettably, that is not an Alolan Form\nPokémon...
That’s one, all right! You have, without a doubt,\ngot yourself an Alolan [VAR 0101(0001)]!
It’s able to glide about by concentrating its\npsychic power in its tail. This Pokémon has\r\nsometimes been called “hodad” as well!
It wobbles the metallic whiskers that sprout from\nits head to communicate with its comrades!
Its shining gold whiskers are advanced sensors\nthat can detect sounds from miles away!
It’s impulsive, selfish, and fickle—but it’s popular\nwith Trainers who like pouring affection on it.
It’s got formidable physical strength, but it’s also\ngot an adorable round face and silky-smooth\r\ncoat that make it mighty popular in Alola!
See, Grimer were brought over to Alola to solve\nthe garbage disposal problems there. Over time,\r\nthe Grimer ended up in this form!
This is a dangerous one! Those things that look\nlike fangs and claws are actually crystallized\r\npoison—touch one, and it’ll afflict you at once!
They say that as Exeggutor grew taller and taller,\nit outgrew its reliance on psychic abilities, and\r\nthe power of the sleeping dragon within it awoke!
It exhales air colder than −58 degrees\nFahrenheit! It’s also sometimes known by\r\nan older name: Keokeo.
It lives deep in the snowy mountains and creates\ndrops of ice in its coat. It even used to be\r\nworshiped as a deity incarnate!
It lives deep in mountainous areas that are\nburied in snow. It’s got a soft belly, but the ice\r\non its back is as hard as steel!
It has developed thick, sharp claws that allow it\nto dash at high speeds even across snowy plains!
Its body is actually a magnetic stone! Iron sand\ngets stuck to the bits that have especially\r\nstrong magnetism.
The stones it likes to eat have caused its whole\nbody to become electrified. It’s got a real\r\ntemper too!
It’s grumpy and stubborn. Upset it, and it’ll let\nout an electric charge and thunder-like growl!
[VAR BD06(0000)]Wait—[VAR 0100(0000)],\nyou\r\nalready\r\nfinished\r\nthe\r\nassignment?![VAR 0114(0049)]
I was really motivated!
It was a walk in the park!
So battling isn’t your only talent, then—you’ve\ngot a knack for catching Pokémon too![VAR 0114(0049)]
It’s easy to see how high level the students must\nbe at Naranja Academy![VAR 0114(0049)]
It’s easy to see how high level the students must\nbe at Uva Academy![VAR 0114(0049)]
All right, everyone! Gather round!
We’re all out of time for today, so that’ll have to\nbe it for this class session.
If you didn’t manage to catch a Pokémon in time,\nthat’ll be your homework to complete before our\r\nnext session. Class dismissed!
Maaan, really? Guess I’m stuck with homework.
[VAR BD06(0000)]So, [VAR 0100(0000)],\nwhat\r\ndid\r\nyou\r\nthink\r\nof\r\nyour\r\nfirst\r\nBlueberry\r\nclass?[VAR 0114(0049)]
It was fun!
It was easy!
Really?! It makes me so happy to hear that![VAR 0114(0049)]
My word, so the classes at your academy are\neven more demanding?[VAR 0114(0049)]
Oh! I was supposed to go make an appearance\nat the clubroom! Shoot![VAR 0114(0049)]
I’m afraid this will have to be the end of our little\ntour, but let me leave you with one more tip![VAR 0114(0049)]
Here at Blueberry, we have lots of extracurricular\ntasks you can do called [VAR FF00(0006)]Blueberry Quests[VAR FF00(0000)], or just\r\n[VAR FF00(0006)]BBQs[VAR FF00(0000)] for short![VAR 0114(0049)]
They’re sort of like missions that the school\nassigns to students out and about in the Terarium.[VAR 0114(0049)]
You might be asked to have your Pokémon do\nsome Auto Battles or to catch specific Pokémon.\r\nThose sorts of things![VAR 0114(0049)]
You never know what the next BBQ might be or\nwhere you’ll need to go to carry it out.[VAR 0114(0049)]
But if you can do what’s asked of you, you’ll earn\n[VAR FF00(0006)]Blueberry Points[VAR FF00(0000)], also called [VAR FF00(0006)]BP[VAR FF00(0000)]![VAR 0114(0049)]
BP is a kind of school currency you can use in the\n[VAR FF00(0006)]cafeteria[VAR FF00(0000)] or at the [VAR FF00(0006)]school store[VAR FF00(0000)].\c\nYou might be able to use it for [VAR FF00(0006)]club activities [VAR FF00(0000)]in\nthe future too...[VAR 0114(0049)]
Anyway! The long and the short of it is that you\nshould do BBQs and get yourself BP![VAR 0114(0049)]
And that’s it from me![VAR 0114(0049)]
Sorry for having to dash, but I really must be off\nnow—enjoy your time at Blueberry Academy![VAR 0114(0049)]
You aren’t quite ready to progress further in the\nadventure awaiting you at Blueberry Academy!\c\nTo do so, you’ll need to have first completed\nyour main adventure in the [VAR FF00(0006)]Paldea region[VAR FF00(0000)] by\r\ncompleting the professor’s last task, as well as\r\nconclude the assignment you were given during\r\nyour school trip to the [VAR FF00(0006)]land of Kitakami[VAR FF00(0000)]!

As for me, well, I’ve been helping Ms. Briar\nwith her research. We’ve been to all sorts of\r\ndifferent regions![VAR 0114(0044)]

Ehehe, you wanna see? Oh, you totally wanna\nsee.\c\nWell, we have a battle court right here, so...\nGet into position![VAR 0114(0044)]
OK, you ready for a Double Battle? You won’t\nknow what hit you![VAR 0114(0044)]

You still don’t hold back in battles, huh? Another\nthing that hasn’t changed a bit...[VAR 0114(0044)]
Hey, by the way...have you, uh, run into Kiki yet?[VAR 0114(0044)]

You’re not wrong, but seriously? That’s how you\nexplain it to new people?[VAR 0114(0044)]
Yup. Though I guess we’re having less of a good\nol’ rowdy time than usual lately.[VAR 0114(004A)]
I’m a member of the club too. I don’t show up to\nthe clubroom very much, though.[VAR 0114(0044)]
Just FYI, the top four Pokémon Trainers in the\nBB League are called the [VAR FF00(0006)]BB League Elite Four[VAR FF00(0000)].[VAR 0114(0044)]
And this annoying toothpaste-haired bozo is one\nof them. So is that girl you saw with me at the\r\nTerarium earlier.[VAR 0114(0044)]
Too bad you didn’t make the cut, Carmine.[VAR 0114(004A)]
I’ve just been too busy with extracurricular\nstuff! Haven’t had time for League matches.[VAR 0114(0044)]
If we’re talking actual skill, I’m WAY above any\nof the Elite Four![VAR 0114(0044)]
Heh heh. That’s no lie.[VAR 0114(004A)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Whatcha think, [VAR 0100(0000)]?\nFun\r\nclub,\r\nhuh?[VAR 0114(004A)]
Oooh, I can feel the enthusiasm! That’s what I’m\ntalkin’ about![VAR 0114(004A)]
I have a feeling you’re more into the idea than\nyou’re letting on![VAR 0114(004A)]
Aaanyway, think that takes care of it. You’re in—\non a trial basis![VAR 0114(004A)]
Huh? What do you mean, “trial basis”?![VAR 0114(0044)]
You heard me! Far as the Drayster’s concerned,\nwe’re clubmates now! Trial-basis clubmates![VAR 0114(004A)]
So now you can use this clubroom freely, and do\nwhatever with the stuff here.[VAR 0114(004A)]
Check out the computer over there, too. It’s\nsuper helpful.[VAR 0114(004A)]
It lets you use your BP to support kids in other\nclubs. They’ll return the favor in different ways.[VAR 0114(004A)]
Here—give it a shot, and you’ll see what I mean.[VAR 0114(004A)]
You received [VAR 0204(0001,0000)] BP from Drayton!
Try sending that to Mitch in the baseball club.\nHe can help you out with your throwing form.[VAR 0114(004A)]
Where you going? You gotta use the computer\nand send Mitch some BP.[VAR 0114(004A)]
Use the computer to help Mitch out with some\nBP. Just give it a shot, and you’ll see what I mean.[VAR 0114(004A)]
It looks like Drayton’s set on you doing this. Just\nplay along, OK?[VAR 0114(0044)]
Oh, whoa—you did it.[VAR 0114(004A)]
Not bad for your first time. That’ll teach me to\ndoubt your skills![VAR 0114(004A)]
Here, I’ve got a really nice present for you—from\none charming catch to another![VAR 0114(004A)]
You can have this too. Put it on, and you’ll look\njust like the Drayster![VAR 0114(004A)]
You received the [VAR FF00(0008)]League Club Uniform[VAR FF00(0000)] from\nDrayton!
Anyway, feel free to computer it up any way you\nwant! Like I said, we’re trial-basis clubmates now.[VAR 0114(004A)]
And that’s not all! For a limited time, you can\nhave as many of these snacks as you want![VAR 0114(004A)]
Those snacks are all yours, Drayton—snacks you\nleave around opened and half-finished.[VAR 0114(0044)]
I wouldn’t go near any of ’em. Who knows how\nlong they’ve been sitting around.[VAR 0114(0044)]
All that explaining left me starving.[VAR 0114(004A)]
Think I’m gonna head on over to the cafeteria.[VAR 0114(004A)]
If you wanna officially join us, maybe we can\nhave a cafeteria date to talk details![VAR 0114(004A)]
A wha—?![VAR 0114(0044)]
Be seein’ ya![VAR 0114(004A)]
Aaagh! That bozo! Seriously, what is his problem?[VAR 0114(0044)]
And a cafeteria date? What does he even mean\nby that?![VAR 0114(0044)]
Calm down, Carmine
Well, a date is...
Just so you know, this is not excitement over the\ndate thing. It’s anger.[VAR 0114(0044)]
No, I KNOW what a date is... Were you seriously\nabout to explain it to me?[VAR 0114(0044)]
*sigh* Sorry. Being in here puts me on edge.[VAR 0114(0044)]
Let’s go somewhere else.[VAR 0114(0044)]
Someplace people won’t bother us... I know!\nLet’s go to your room.[VAR 0114(0044)]
You don’t know where your room is? Just wander\naround, and you’ll find it eventually.[VAR 0114(0044)]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Text File : sdc02_0090
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Well, it looks like this is your room.[VAR 0114(0044)]
Most BB students live in the dorms, you know.[VAR 0114(0044)]
So, what do you think? How’s it compare to\nthe dorm rooms back at your school?[VAR 0114(0044)]
So blue!
So new!
About the same!
Well, we’re at BLUEberry Academy... ’Course\nit’s blue!\c\nYou can come have a look at my room later, too,\nif you want.[VAR 0114(0044)]
Heh, you bet it’s new! State of the art, in fact!\nYou can come have a look at my room later, too,\r\nif you want.[VAR 0114(0044)]
Whaaat? Psh, that’s no fun... Well, you can come\nhave a look at my room later, too, if you want.[VAR 0114(0044)]
Oh, but I got distracted. There’s something I\nneed to tell you![VAR 0114(0044)]
It’s about Drayton and...well, Kiki.[VAR 0114(0044)]
About Drayton?
About Kieran?
And there’s one more thing I need to tell you\nabout![VAR 0114(0044)]
Ugh, Drayton... Don’t trust that knucklehead![VAR 0114(0044)]
He might seem like a slacker, but don’t let him\nfool you! He’s up to something![VAR 0114(0044)]
He’s a real annoying super jerk![VAR 0114(0044)]
He barely even goes to class! He’s had to repeat\nthe same year three times![VAR 0114(0044)]
Point is, don’t let your guard down around him...\never![VAR 0114(0044)]
Kiki is... Well, you saw how he is. He’s scaring\nme nowadays.[VAR 0114(0044)]
Ever since we got back from Kitakami, it’s like\nhe’s become a totally different person.[VAR 0114(0044)]
He’s been battling and training every day... He’s\neven cutting back on sleep.[VAR 0114(0044)]
He’s...he’s definitely gotten stronger.[VAR 0114(0044)]
Drayton used to be the strongest student here,\nbut Kiki beat him.[VAR 0114(0044)]
Now Kiki’s the president of the League Club\nAND the BB League Champion.[VAR 0114(0044)]
I guess he must be pretty busy... He barely talks\nto me anymore.[VAR 0114(0044)]
Oh well! He’s probably just going through a\nrebellious phase.[VAR 0114(0044)]
Kieran’s changed...but you? You’ve stayed the\nsame.[VAR 0114(0044)]
If Kieran’s down to just one friend these days, I’m\nglad it’s you. Keep sticking with him, would you?[VAR 0114(0044)]
Thank you![VAR 0114(0044)]
Can’t you read the room? You were supposed to\nsay yes![VAR 0114(0044)]
You’re going on your date—I mean, you’re\ngonna go hang out with Drayton later, right?[VAR 0114(0044)]
I’d go with, but if I don’t finish up this report\ntoday, I’m really gonna be in trouble...[VAR 0114(0044)]
I’d love for you to join the League Club...[VAR 0114(0044)]
But if Drayton gives you any trouble, don’t be\nafraid to give him a good Sucker Punch![VAR 0114(0044)]
If Drayton says anything stupid, just hit him with\na Sucker Punch![VAR 0114(0044)]

Hey, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(004A)]
No need to stand there. Grab a seat.[VAR 0114(004A)]
Here’s the Drayster take: The Academy Special’s\nthe best thing on the menu.[VAR 0114(004A)]
It’s all so soft, you can basically just gulp it down.\nBarely even need to chew.[VAR 0114(004A)]
Wow, that sounds tasty!
...Chew your food, Drayton
Heh heh! You know what’s up.[VAR 0114(004A)]
Heh heh! You and my ma would get along.[VAR 0114(004A)]
So listen—your Pokémon are pretty strong, yeah?[VAR 0114(004A)]
With a team like that, you’ve got a shot at\nbecoming the BB League Champion.[VAR 0114(004A)]
Wouldn’t that be wild? An exchange student just\nrolling up here and snatching the crown?[VAR 0114(004A)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]I wanna see you join the BB League,\n[VAR 0100(0000)].\r\nYou in?[VAR 0114(004A)]
Sure, I’ll—
I don’t kno—
Whoa, it’s the Champion!
And the rest of the Elite Four, too!
Look who’s decided to grace us with their\npresence.[VAR 0114(004A)]
...What did you want to talk to me about?[VAR 0114(0043)]
Nothing special. Just thought we could grab\na bite.[VAR 0114(004A)]
Where better to do that than the cafeteria?[VAR 0114(004A)]
What a waste of time...[VAR 0114(0043)]
If you’ve got so much time to goof off, why don’t\nyou go train your Pokémon?[VAR 0114(0043)]
You think maybe this is why you always lose\nto me?[VAR 0114(0043)]
I’ll take that as a no.[VAR 0114(004A)]
So I can’t swing a lunch date with you, even if\nI’ve got your ol’ pal with me?[VAR 0114(004A)]
Huh—?! [VAR 0100(0000)]?![VAR 0114(0043)]
Long time no see!
You look different
Wh-why...?[VAR 0114(0043)]
You didn’t hear that [VAR 1100(00FF,0100)]she was coming to study\nabroad here?[VAR 0114(004A)]
For real?[VAR 0114(0043)]
Yes, it’s true.[VAR 0114(0049)]
Director Cyrano himself introduced h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]imer to me\nwhen we met at the school’s entrance.[VAR 0114(0049)]
... ... ...[VAR 0114(0043)]
We’re already tight, us two.[VAR 0114(004A)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]In fact, I was just asking\n[VAR 0100(0000)]\r\nto\r\njoin\r\nthe\r\nBB League![VAR 0114(004A)]
Ooh, I like it! That’d be fire![VAR 0114(002C)]
Wha—?![VAR 0114(0049)]
A student from another school joining the\nBB League? Unprecedented.[VAR 0114(002C)]
Th-that’s right![VAR 0114(0049)]
[VAR BD06(0000)][VAR 0100(0000)] may be wonderfully\ncapable\r\nin\r\nbattle,\r\nbut\r\nthat\r\ndoesn’t\r\nmean\r\n[VAR 1100(00FF,0100)]she\r\nbelongs\r\nin\r\nthe\r\nBB League...[VAR 0114(0049)]
Aw, c’mon. Do you all hate fun and friendship or\nsomething?[VAR 0114(004A)]
You wanna exclude someone who’s taking our\nsame classes and living in our same dorms?\r\nHow’s [VAR 1100(00FF,0100)]she not one of us?![VAR 0114(004A)]
And isn’t this place supposed to be all about\nstudents having autonomy?[VAR 0114(004A)]
I think we should vote on it.[VAR 0114(004A)]
I’m a yes, obviously. How ’bout you, Lacey?[VAR 0114(004A)]
I...I’m sorry, but considering the rules, it’s a no\nfrom me.[VAR 0114(0049)]
What about you, Crispin?[VAR 0114(0049)]
Huh? Yeah, why not![VAR 0114(0047)]
[VAR 1100(00FF,0201)]HShe’s at our school. That makes h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]imer a student\nlike us, right?[VAR 0114(0047)]
How ’bout you, Amarys? Whaddya say?[VAR 0114(0047)]
I abide by the rules of this institution. Proposition\ndeclined.[VAR 0114(0048)]
Two against two, huh.[VAR 0114(004A)]
All right, then! What says the reigning BB League\nChampion, our mighty Kieran?[VAR 0114(004A)]
... ... ...[VAR 0114(0043)]
It doesn’t matter who I’m facing...[VAR 0114(0043)]
I don’t lose.[VAR 0114(0043)]
Heh. Guess we’ve got our answer.[VAR 0114(004A)]
... ... ...[VAR 0114(0043)]
Ah! Kieran, wait—![VAR 0114(0049)]
Drayton! Manipulating people to get what you\nwant—it’s just not right![VAR 0114(0049)]
Sorry, [VAR 0100(0000)]...[VAR 0114(004A)]
Guess you’ll be joining the BB League, huh?[VAR 0114(004A)]
Well, let’s look on the bright side! Maybe you\nand Kieran’ll come out of this better friends![VAR 0114(004A)]
Don’t worry, I’ll be right behind you. Every step\nof the way.[VAR 0114(004A)]
But now that the decision’s been made, we better\nget you officially signed up.[VAR 0114(004A)]
Meet me at the reception desk in the school’s\nentrance area![VAR 0114(004A)]
There you are! This is where we can get you\nsigned up for the BB League.[VAR 0114(004A)]

How can I help you today?
I want to join the BB League!
Never mind, I’m good...
Ah. It says here that you’re an exchange student,\nwhich means you’re not technically enrolled here\r\nat our academy...
Oh, don’t mind that![VAR 0114(004A)]
We Elite Four talked it over real quick. My friend\nhere’s good to join.[VAR 0114(004A)]
I don’t mean to sound rude, but I’m not sure if I\ncan take what you say at face value, Drayton...
No, he’s telling the truth.[VAR 0114(0043)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]I’m allowing [VAR 0100(0000)]\nto\r\njoin\r\nthe\r\nBB League.[VAR 0114(0043)]
Yes, Champion! One moment, please...
Didn’t expect you to ride up in shining armor and\nsave the day.[VAR 0114(004A)]
I’ve got a feeling you’re trying to play puppet\nmaster...[VAR 0114(0043)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]But if I get a shot at battling\n[VAR 0100(0000)],\r\nthen\r\nthat’s\r\nfine\r\nwith me.[VAR 0114(0043)]
Heh heh. That’s just peachy.[VAR 0114(004A)]
[VAR 0100(0000)]...[VAR 0114(0043)]
You better not go losing to anyone until our\nbattle.[VAR 0114(0043)]
I’ll try my best!
Like I’d lose!
Good.[VAR 0114(0043)]
I’m not a little kid anymore. And you’ll know it\nwhen I show you how the best of the best battle.[VAR 0114(0043)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Kiki! You shouldn’t talk to\n[VAR 0100(0000)]\r\nlike\r\nthat...[VAR 0114(0044)]
Shut it, Sis.[VAR 0114(0043)]
Looking forward to seeing you climb the ranks.[VAR 0114(0043)]
... ... ...[VAR 0114(0044)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]I’m sorry, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nKiki\r\nwas\r\nreally\r\nacting\r\nout,\r\nwasn’t he?[VAR 0114(0044)]
That was my first time talking to him in a while,\ntoo. Man, such an attitude...[VAR 0114(0044)]
Well, he’s Mr. Big-Deal Mighty Champion,\nafter all.[VAR 0114(004A)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Drayton, you’re the one who dragged\n[VAR 0100(0000)]\r\ninto\r\nall\r\nthis\r\nBB\r\nLeague\r\ndrama,\r\naren’t you?![VAR 0114(0044)]
Me? No way. This was all h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]iser idea![VAR 0114(004A)]
Right, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(004A)]
That’s the spirit. Feeling that human urge to do\ngreat things, right?[VAR 0114(004A)]
“No...doubt about it!”\nHear that, Carmine? [VAR 1100(00FF,0201)]HShe’s hungry for action![VAR 0114(004A)]
I dunno, I think something fishy’s going on...[VAR 0114(0044)]
But, well...if you’re gonna do this, you might as\nwell do your best. I’ll be cheering for you.[VAR 0114(0044)]
And please...keep an eye on Kiki for me.[VAR 0114(0044)]
Thank you for waiting! Your entry into the\nBB League is complete!
Great timing.[VAR 0114(004A)]
[VAR BD06(0000)][VAR 0100(0000)] is cleared to compete\nin\r\nthe\r\nBB League!
Usually, you’d start by battling regular students\nand climbing the ranks...
But seeing as how you’ve got recommendations\nfrom several Elite Four members and Director\r\nCyrano, you’ll start from a higher rank.
You’ll skip straight to challenging the Elite Four\nat their respective bases in the Terarium. Once\r\nyou clear their trials, that is.
I’ll go ahead and mark their locations in your\nRotom Phone now!
To challenge the Elite Four, you’ll need [VAR FF00(0006)]BP[VAR FF00(0000)], which\nyou can earn by doing [VAR FF00(0006)]BBQs[VAR FF00(0000)].\c\nThen, if you defeat all the members of the Elite\nFour, you can challenge the Champion.
All right, then! Best of luck in the BB League!
You can start with whichever of us you want.\nYour call.[VAR 0114(004A)]
Any time you want to battle one of us, you’ll\nhave to do a fun little trial we cooked up first.\r\nSounds good, right?[VAR 0114(004A)]
Catch you in the Terarium, bud![VAR 0114(004A)]
Best of luck in the BB League!

Yo, Champ in the making.[VAR 0114(004A)]
Sorry for the holdup. I’m back.[VAR 0114(004A)]
That’s one Elite Four member beat. Things are\nlookin’ good for you![VAR 0114(004A)]
Crispin’s no pushover—he’s just super\nstraightforward.[VAR 0114(004A)]
I think that’s kinda part of his charm, y’know?[VAR 0114(004A)]
We used to all chow down on Crispin’s cooking\nafter club activities let out. Those were the days.[VAR 0114(004A)]
Guess he’s been worrying about the way things\nare, too, in his own way.[VAR 0114(004A)]
Amarys sure leaves an impression, huh?[VAR 0114(004A)]
It’s wild seeing her and Carmine talk. You’d never\nguess it, but they click in a weird way. It’s pretty\r\nfunny to watch.[VAR 0114(004A)]
The thing about Amarys is, as rigid as she looks,\nshe’s got a sensitive streak a mile wide.[VAR 0114(004A)]
Remember that about her, OK? Even if it’s hard\nto tell from outside.[VAR 0114(004A)]
Lacey’s all about cuteness—and that’s what helps\nher make her Pokémon stronger.[VAR 0114(004A)]
She’s so into her team, training the little cuties\ndoesn’t even feel like work to her. Wild, right?[VAR 0114(004A)]
I bet it’s the same for you, huh? You work so hard\nat it ’cause you like it![VAR 0114(004A)]
Unlike a certain someone who seems busy\nrunning himself and everyone around him into\r\nthe ground just to get a bit stronger.[VAR 0114(004A)]
Y’know, Lacey’s polite to everyone else, but\nshe’s really blunt with me... I wonder why?[VAR 0114(004A)]
Here’s your reward, like I said.[VAR 0114(004A)]
Guess I should’ve cleaned it, but what’s a little\ndust between friends?[VAR 0114(004A)]
You just might be the one we need to shake\nthings up in the League Club.[VAR 0114(004A)]

That’s three of the Elite Four you’ve trounced\nnow. Seeing how far you’re getting is making me\r\nsweat a little.[VAR 0114(004A)]
Crispin’s no pushover—he’s just super\nstraightforward.[VAR 0114(004A)]
I think that’s kinda part of his charm, y’know?[VAR 0114(004A)]
We used to all chow down on Crispin’s cooking\nafter club activities let out. Those were the days.[VAR 0114(004A)]
Guess he’s been worrying about the way things\nare, too, in his own way.[VAR 0114(004A)]
Amarys sure leaves an impression, huh?[VAR 0114(004A)]
It’s wild seeing her and Carmine talk. You’d never\nguess it, but they click in a weird way. It’s pretty\r\nfunny to watch.[VAR 0114(004A)]
The thing about Amarys is, as rigid as she looks,\nshe’s got a sensitive streak a mile wide.[VAR 0114(004A)]
Remember that about her, OK? Even if it’s hard\nto tell from outside.[VAR 0114(004A)]
Lacey’s all about cuteness—and that’s what helps\nher make her Pokémon stronger.[VAR 0114(004A)]
She’s so into her team, training the little cuties\ndoesn’t even feel like work to her. Wild, right?[VAR 0114(004A)]
I bet it’s the same for you, huh? You work so hard\nat it ’cause you like it![VAR 0114(004A)]
Unlike a certain someone who seems busy\nrunning himself and everyone around him into\r\nthe ground just to get a bit stronger.[VAR 0114(004A)]
Y’know, Lacey’s polite to everyone else, but\nshe’s really blunt with me... I wonder why?[VAR 0114(004A)]
Here’s your reward, like I said.[VAR 0114(004A)]
Guess I should’ve cleaned it, but what’s a little\ndust between friends?[VAR 0114(004A)]
Y’know, bud, seeing skills like yours up close and\npersonal really leaves an impression.\c\nNo wonder it had such an effect on Kieran...[VAR 0114(004A)]
But enough about that.[VAR 0114(004A)]
I guess your Elite Fourth match is gonna be\nagainst Crispin.\c\nThat guy runs white hot. Do yourself a favor—\ncool him off with some cold water.[VAR 0114(004A)]
I guess your Elite Fourth match is gonna be\nagainst Amarys.\c\nShe’s cold as steel. You’ll need some burning\nhot flames to melt her.[VAR 0114(004A)]
I guess your Elite Fourth match is gonna be\nagainst Lacey.\c\nShe’s no pushover, tell you what. But you oughta\nbe able to take her, bud.[VAR 0114(004A)]
I guess your Elite Fourth match is gonna be\nagainst me.\c\nNice of you to save the best for last. You gave\nme plenty of time to get ready.[VAR 0114(004A)]
See ya soon. Show us what you got.[VAR 0114(004A)]

Man, it’s like I blinked and you’d plowed through\nthe whole BB League.[VAR 0114(004A)]
You know what’s next for you, right, bud?[VAR 0114(004A)]
You’re good enough to beat all Elite Four of us...[VAR 0114(004A)]
So you, and only you, have the right to challenge\nthe sitting BB League Champion, Kieran![VAR 0114(004A)]
You really kept me waiting.[VAR 0114(0043)]
Took you a while to beat the Elite Four. Kind of\nslow for you, isn’t it?[VAR 0114(0043)]
Nice, Kieran.[VAR 0114(004A)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]You’ve really got [VAR 0100(0000)]\non\r\nthe\r\nbrain, huh?[VAR 0114(004A)]
I could say the same thing about you, Drayton.[VAR 0114(0043)]
You sure are putting a lot of effort into helping\n[VAR 0100(0000)] out.[VAR 0114(0043)]
Who wouldn’t help out a new student?\nGotta be good to our fellow humans.[VAR 0114(004A)]
That’s rich coming from you...[VAR 0114(0043)]
Whatever you’re planning, it’s about to come\nto an end.[VAR 0114(0043)]
[VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0043)]
Let’s settle who’s the strongest between us two,\nonce and for all.[VAR 0114(0043)]
You’ll be battling the best of the best now. I’ll be\nwaiting.[VAR 0114(0043)]
It’s finally time. I’m pumped for you.[VAR 0114(004A)]
We’ll have to go sign you up at the front desk\nto get your Championship match going.[VAR 0114(004A)]

Hey yo, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(004A)]
Ready to sign up for your official match?[VAR 0114(004A)]
You’re [VAR 0100(0000)], yes?
Let me get your Championship match set up.\nThis will just take a moment.
[VAR BD06(0000)]So, [VAR 0100(0000)]...you said you\nand\r\nKieran\r\nare\r\nfriends,\r\nright?[VAR 0114(004A)]
Yeah!
Well, sorta...
Huh. No kidding.[VAR 0114(004A)]
No need to be shy about it. Friend drama’s just\npart of life at your age.[VAR 0114(004A)]
Here’s the Drayster take: I liked Kieran better\nwhen his hair was down.[VAR 0114(004A)]
He used to be this quiet little guy. Trembled like\na leaf. Had all the spine of a Wimpod.\c\nHe’d hide behind Carmine if you so much as\nbreathed too loud. But I tell you what...[VAR 0114(004A)]
When it came to Pokémon battling, I never saw\nso much joy in anyone’s eyes as in his![VAR 0114(004A)]
But then, outta nowhere, he...changed.[VAR 0114(004A)]
Now he’s relentless—pushes himself, pushes\neveryone around him...[VAR 0114(004A)]
Nothing good’s gonna come of this. Someone’s\ngotta snap him out of it.[VAR 0114(004A)]
I tried but couldn’t do it. Guess I’ve gone soft\nfrom the lazy life. So now I guess it falls to you.\r\nSorry, bud.[VAR 0114(004A)]
Sorry to keep you waiting! Everything’s ready.
Are you ready to battle Kieran, the BB League\nChampion?
Please come back when you’re ready.
Understood.\c\nYour Championship match will begin soon.\nPlease make sure you are ready.
[VAR BD06(0000)]Well, it’s all up to you now,\n[VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(004A)]

I put everything into studying and making my\nPokémon stronger...[VAR 0114(0043)]

Proceed with what?[VAR 0114(004A)]
Well, think about it a moment, would you?![VAR 0114(0049)]

Area Zero?! That’s that place in Paldea you\nwanted to visit, right? You got permission?![VAR 0114(0044)]

But to be honest, I also have one more ambition\nfor this trip.[VAR 0114(0042)]

Your talent is as brilliant as always, I see. Truly a\nwonderful thing.[VAR 0114(0011)]
If you’ll be going along, then I suppose that\nbodes well...[VAR 0114(0011)]
Is it all right if I explain the situation to the\nchildren, Briar?[VAR 0114(0011)]
By all means.[VAR 0114(0042)]
First, allow me to introduce myself.\c\nMy name is Geeta. I am the chairwoman of\nthe Pokémon League in Paldea.[VAR 0114(0011)]
More than a decade ago, the Pokémon League\nprovided support for research on Area Zero—the\r\ngreat crater at the center of Paldea.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Once that research was complete, we shifted\nour duties to monitoring and managing the area.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Area Zero is full of mysteries—and also danger.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Generally speaking, the area is off-limits, even\nfor research.[VAR 0114(0011)]
That being said...[VAR 0114(0011)]
Recently, we’ve had to confront the possibility\nthat dangerous Pokémon could escape the area.[VAR 0114(0011)]
There’s a clear need for further research—\nand quickly.[VAR 0114(0011)]
But at our Pokémon League, we’ve had\ntrouble finding capable personnel—not to\r\nmention time—to study Area Zero.[VAR 0114(0011)]
So...[VAR 0114(0011)]
You reached out to me, as I’ve been requesting\naccess to the area for quite some time now.[VAR 0114(0042)]
I apologize that we are not better equipped to\ndeal with this ourselves.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Blueberry Academy has a wealth of highly skilled\nTrainers with well-trained Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0011)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]And with Champion [VAR 0100(0000)]\nalso\r\non\r\nthe\r\nteam,\r\nI’d\r\nknow\r\nI\r\ncould\r\nsafely\r\ninitiate\r\na\r\nnew\r\nexpedition.[VAR 0114(0011)]
This is entirely voluntary, of course, but it would\nbe very reassuring to have you with us![VAR 0114(0042)]
What do you say? Will you join our little team\nas we explore Area Zero?[VAR 0114(0042)]
I’m in!
I dunno...
[VAR BD06(0000)]Splendid. Well said, Champion\n[VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0011)]
I’m afraid I must insist that you go along,\nChampion [VAR 0100(0000)].\c\nYou have been to the depths of Area Zero\nalready, after all.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Uh, well... I think it’s already decided that I’m\ngoing.[VAR 0114(0044)]
Your support will be very useful as always,\nCarmine. I appreciate having you on board.[VAR 0114(0042)]
Sorry, but I’ll pass on this one.[VAR 0114(004A)]
The League Club’s a whole mess right now.\nWe need my steady hand on the wheel here.[VAR 0114(004A)]
Suuure. You just can’t be bothered to travel all\nthe way to Paldea, can you?[VAR 0114(0044)]
Heh heh. Guilty.[VAR 0114(004A)]
I’m curious what our mighty ex-Champion is\nthinking, though.[VAR 0114(004A)]
...I’m going.[VAR 0114(0043)]
If there’s a Legendary Pokémon there, I want to\nfind it...and catch it. This time...I won’t let this\r\nchance go.[VAR 0114(0043)]
Interesting.[VAR 0114(004A)]
Then it’s decided!\c\nIt’s too bad that Drayton won’t be joining us, but\nit seems the team will consist of Carmine, Kieran,\r\n[VAR 0100(0000)], and myself.[VAR 0114(0042)]
You have my thanks for your help on this matter.[VAR 0114(0011)]
I look forward to the great findings that you will\nno doubt bring back![VAR 0114(0011)]
I’m grateful for the opportunity, Geeta. Leave it\nto me.[VAR 0114(0042)]
My dream of exploring Area Zero is finally\nbecoming a reality![VAR 0114(0042)]

But not enough to get you off the hook![VAR 0114(0013)]

Don’t think you’re not gonna get a scolding for\nthat![VAR 0114(0013)]
I’m really sorry...
That’s what Champions...do?
Oh sure, NOW you’re sorry—I practically fell out\nof my seat when I heard about where you’d been![VAR 0114(0013)]
What’s that got to do with anything?! You can’t\njust go breaking rules willy-nilly![VAR 0114(0013)]
Calm down, Rika. No harm came to h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]imer, after all.[VAR 0114(0011)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]And besides, we have good reason to believe\nthat all of Paldea would have been at risk if\r\nChampion [VAR 0100(0000)] here\r\nhadn’t\r\nventured\r\ninto\r\nArea\r\nZero.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Well, yeah, I mean that’s true, but...[VAR 0114(0013)]
Fine. I’ll let you off the hook this one time. You’d\nbetter thank the boss for steppin’ in.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Don’t think poorly of Rika. She’s just worried\nfor you.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Now then, Champion [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0011)]
This time, you’ll be heading to Area Zero with\nofficial League permission.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Only a handful of people know about the\nincident involving the time machine.[VAR 0114(0011)]
However, taking into account the dangers of\nArea Zero, I have elected to inform Ms. Briar\r\nof what happened—obfuscating certain details.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Speaking of, Boss... Didn’t you say you had\nsomething to give to that Briar person?[VAR 0114(0013)]
...Yes. Yes, I did. I’d forgotten about that.[VAR 0114(0011)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Champion [VAR 0100(0000)],\nwould\r\nyou\r\nbe\r\nso\r\nkind\r\nas\r\nto\r\ntake\r\nthis\r\nfor\r\nme?[VAR 0114(0011)]
What is that, anyway—a TM or something?[VAR 0114(0013)]
It is a disk that was sent by an Area Zero\nresearcher to an investor some time ago.[VAR 0114(0011)]
I had my investigation team look into it. It is\ncertainly not a TM, nor is it a mere tool for\r\nstoring data.[VAR 0114(0011)]
I honestly have no idea as to its true purpose...\nBut I assume it has to do with Area Zero.[VAR 0114(0011)]
I figured that since you’re heading to Area Zero,\nI might as well ask you to investigate the purpose\r\nof this disk while you’re there.[VAR 0114(0011)]
While [VAR 1100(00FF,0100)]she’s there, huh? Did you want h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]imer to pick\nup some potato salad on the way back, too?[VAR 0114(0013)]
I do ask that you return the disk to me if you end\nup not finding a use for it.[VAR 0114(0011)]
There is still much we do not know about Area\nZero...[VAR 0114(0011)]
I know you’ve already been to its depths, but\nplease exercise some caution while dealing with\r\nthe environment and Pokémon there.[VAR 0114(0011)]
As a Champion, it falls on you to protect and\nguide those accompanying you.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Wish I could go with you, kiddo, but I’ve got my\nown work to do...[VAR 0114(0013)]
Do your best down there, but don’t push yourself\ntoo hard, y’hear?[VAR 0114(0013)]
Now, please excuse us.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Area Zero, right? C’mon, let’s go. I wanna get\nstarted.[VAR 0114(0043)]
Kiki’s awful quiet. I hope he’s OK... He was so\nbent out of shape when he lost...[VAR 0114(0044)]

Splendid! We’re finally ready to set off, then![VAR 0114(0042)]
Are you two feeling all right? Well enough to\ntravel, at least?[VAR 0114(0042)]

Whoa... This is incredible.[VAR 0114(0044)]

[VAR BD06(0000)]Uh... So you’ve been here before, right,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0043)]
Yeah, with my friends!
Yeah, with my buddies!
Friends, huh?[VAR 0114(0043)]
Buddies, huh?[VAR 0114(0043)]
Agias!!!
Eeek! You scared me![VAR 0114(0044)]
Honestly! You’re too big to come popping out\nlike that, er...Whatchama-don![VAR 0114(0044)]
Agia?
[VAR BD06(0000)]So you came here with\n[VAR 0100(0000)]\r\nback\r\nthen\r\ntoo, huh?[VAR 0114(0043)]
Oh! You must be that Pokémon that was\nreportedly first discovered in Area Zero![VAR 0114(0042)]
I’m very intrigued by this specimen, but\nalas, that’s not what we’re here for.\c\nWe’re here to go to the deepest depths of\nArea Zero...[VAR 0114(0042)]
And see what’s [VAR FF00(0006)]even deeper[VAR FF00(0000)]![VAR 0114(0042)]
What do you mean “even deeper”?
Deeper down than the Zero Lab?
Heath mentioned in his writings that he fell from\nthe depths to someplace even deeper.[VAR 0114(0042)]
Wait, hold on. Doesn’t the “depths” imply he was\nas deep as he could get?[VAR 0114(0044)]
Yes! It’s quite curious, isn’t it?[VAR 0114(0042)]
However, Heath also wrote that he was utterly\nunable to recall how he got down there.[VAR 0114(0042)]
If his writings are to be believed, there must be\nan entire uncharted space below Area Zero...[VAR 0114(0042)]
Well, either way, we should start by making for\nthe Zero Lab down in the depths.\c\nYou take the lead, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0042)]

Whoa, this place is insane! It reminds me of the\nCrystal Pool![VAR 0114(0044)]
This is the Zero Lab, I take it? The structure’s\nexterior matches Geeta’s description, at least.[VAR 0114(0042)]
So this is the deepest point in Area Zero?[VAR 0114(0043)]
Right!
Nope!
Well, yes and no.[VAR 0114(0042)]
This is the deepest point that the Area Zero\nExpedition managed to reach long ago.[VAR 0114(0042)]
You know, I’ve been told that the lowest level of\nthis laboratory contains a mysterious room whose\r\npurpose is entirely unknown.[VAR 0114(0042)]
However, where I want to go is even deeper\nthan that...[VAR 0114(0042)]
Sooo, you’re saying we should head\ninside this...“Zero Lab”?[VAR 0114(0044)]
Gate’s closed, though.[VAR 0114(0043)]
Huh? Oh, you’re right.[VAR 0114(0044)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]What do we do now, [VAR 0100(0000)]?\nYou’ve\r\nbeen\r\nhere\r\nbefore, right?[VAR 0114(0044)]
We need to use the panel!
We gotta disable the lock!
Wowzers, this feels like a spy movie or\nsomethin’... Way cool...[VAR 0114(0043)]
What? I didn’t say anything.[VAR 0114(0043)]
Well then, can we count on you to unlock the\ngate, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0042)]
The “Zero Lab,” huh... If it were up to me,\nI would’ve named this place the “Crystal Lab.”[VAR 0114(0044)]
Wow, that panel disables the lock on the gate,\nhuh?\c\nI mean, uh...whatever.[VAR 0114(0043)]
Could you use the panel over there to unlock\nthe gate for us?[VAR 0114(0042)]

What’s the matter? Something wrong with it?[VAR 0114(0044)]
It opened before though, right? Is there some\nextra step we’re missing?[VAR 0114(0042)]
There were four locks before, and...
The professor was in the lab, and...
I see... So last time, you went through a series of\nsteps to unlock the gate, and the professor was\r\nalso there to guide you from the inside...[VAR 0114(0042)]

Oh? Geeta gave you a mysterious item before\nwe departed, did she? You think that’s it?[VAR 0114(0042)]

C’mon, hurry up! You take the lead![VAR 0114(0044)]

Where’s Ms. Briar, anyway?[VAR 0114(0043)]
She’s busy rummaging through, like, a whole\nstack of documents over there.[VAR 0114(0044)]
Aren’t those someone’s private photos and stuff?\nWe probably shouldn’t be looking at all that...[VAR 0114(0043)]
Huh, you’re awfully considerate all of a sudden.[VAR 0114(0044)]
Ms. Briar, look! An elevator! Maybe it can take\nus further down? You wanted to go down, right?[VAR 0114(0044)]
“Down,” you say?![VAR 0114(0042)]
Oh my! Did you use this elevator last time to\nreach the mysterious room I mentioned earlier?[VAR 0114(0042)]
Sure did!
I...think so?
How exciting![VAR 0114(0042)]
Oh? Did you already forget what happened last\ntime you were here?\c\nPerhaps this is a side effect of prolonged\nexposure to Area Zero...[VAR 0114(0042)]
Well, we’ve no time to waste. Let’s go down![VAR 0114(0042)]

Hey...everyone?[VAR 0114(0043)]
That panel we used to unlock the gate...[VAR 0114(0043)]
Didn’t it say something about where the elevator\ngoes?[VAR 0114(0043)]
Now that you mention it, yeah... Something\nabout an elevator being redirected, right?[VAR 0114(0044)]
As far as I know, there is only one elevator inside\nthe Zero Lab...\c\nSo the panel must have been referring to the\nelevator we’re currently inside.[VAR 0114(0042)]

This is a report written by the esteemed\nProfessor Turo![VAR 0114(0042)]
A massive cavern exists beneath Area Zero,\nand there slumbers Terapagos, [VAR FF00(0006)]the hidden[VAR FF00(0000)]\n[VAR FF00(0006)]treasure of Area Zero[VAR FF00(0000)]. Its body has become\ncrystal, protecting it from hostile outsiders.\nIt appears that rousing it will take some time.
In this cavern, I have witnessed the Terastal\nphenomenon occurring in a way I’ve never seen\naboveground—Terastallization that appears to\nhold the power of every known type. I have\ndubbed this Tera Type the [VAR FF00(0006)]Stellar[VAR FF00(0000)] type for now.\nCould Terapagos’s influence be at play?

Did knocking out that sparkling Pokémon make\nthe crystal flower disappear?[VAR 0114(0044)]
It’s just like in that report we found earlier...[VAR 0114(0042)]
What we just witnessed was a Pokémon wielding\nthe powers of each and every type.\c\nThat means it must have had the [VAR FF00(0006)]Stellar[VAR FF00(0000)]\n[VAR FF00(0006)]Tera Type[VAR FF00(0000)]![VAR 0114(0042)]

I can’t say for certain, but...no. I don’t think so.[VAR 0114(0042)]
The professor’s notes said the hidden treasure of\nArea Zero is slumbering in crystal form.[VAR 0114(0042)]
The Glimmora you just fought off doesn’t fully fit\nthat description, so I don’t think it’s the Pokémon\r\nthe professor called Terapagos.[VAR 0114(0042)]
Well, the only way to know if it was the hidden\ntreasure or not is to keep going.[VAR 0114(0043)]

I bet the path’ll open up if we can defeat that\nsparkly Pokémon up there.\c\nWell? What’re you waiting for? Hop on your\nWhatchama-don and get over to that cliff![VAR 0114(0044)]
If that sparkling Pokémon wasn’t so far away,\nI’d make quick work of ’em.[VAR 0114(0043)]

There, Kieran—up ahead! There’s something\namong those pillars![VAR 0114(0042)]
This stone’s the hidden treasure?[VAR 0114(0043)]
Give me a moment. I just need to check\nsomething...[VAR 0114(0042)]

But, Kiki—you did your best, too![VAR 0114(0044)]
Even YOU, Sis![VAR 0114(0043)]
You were being all nasty toward h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]imer at first, but\nthen boom! You were like best friends in no time![VAR 0114(0043)]
I... Well...[VAR 0114(0044)]

Very well done, Kieran![VAR 0114(0042)]
The fact that you brought along a Master Ball\ntells me you were well prepared for this![VAR 0114(0042)]
Now I can study Terapagos whenever I want...\nBut! There’s no time like the present![VAR 0114(0042)]

[VAR BD06(0000)]Well, you heard her,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]...[VAR 0114(0043)]

Wh-why?![VAR 0114(0043)]
I thought if I just had Terapagos—if I had the\nhidden treasure of Area Zero, it...[VAR 0114(0043)]
it would make me stronger...[VAR 0114(0043)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]I thought it’d let me beat\n[VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0043)]
Kiki, that’s enough! It’s time to stop this—[VAR 0114(0044)]
No. Something’s not right.[VAR 0114(0042)]
Its Terastal energy output is far too low.[VAR 0114(0042)]
Not to mention the fact that it looks different\nfrom the illustration in the Scarlet Book...[VAR 0114(0042)]
Not to mention the fact that it looks different\nfrom the illustration in the Violet Book...[VAR 0114(0042)]
So...Terapagos isn’t the hidden treasure of Area\nZero?[VAR 0114(0043)]
No, I’m sure it is. We must be missing something—\na way to transform it into the treasure...[VAR 0114(0042)]
Of course! Terapagos is made of Terastal energy![VAR 0114(0042)]
Kieran! You must Terastallize Terapagos this\ninstant![VAR 0114(0042)]
If my hunch is correct, Terapagos will resonate\nwith the energy from your Tera Orb...[VAR 0114(0042)]

THIS is the hidden treasure of Area Zero![VAR 0114(0042)]

[VAR BD06(0000)]Hey, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nGlad\r\nto\r\nsee\r\nyou.[VAR 0114(0042)]
You feeling rested and recovered after our big\nadventure down in the underdepths?[VAR 0114(0042)]
Oh, youth really is an enviable thing!\c\nI’m still feeling all wrung out despite having\nbeen back for a while now![VAR 0114(0042)]
Really? I thought you’d be all chipper by now.\nYouth is on your side, after all![VAR 0114(0042)]
But on to why I called you here. Since our return,\nI’ve been writing up everything we discovered on\r\nour expedition. Honestly, I’ve hardly slept![VAR 0114(0042)]
I obtained Geeta’s permission to turn it all into a\nbook, but don’t worry—I’ve made sure to skip a\r\nfew details and omit the names of those involved.[VAR 0114(0042)]
So voilà! A proof copy of the book, freshly\ndelivered from my publisher, just for you.[VAR 0114(0042)]
I behaved recklessly in the underdepths. I don’t\nknow what we would’ve done if it weren’t for you.[VAR 0114(0042)]
You truly deserve a copy of this book—I just\nhope it’s sufficient as an apology.[VAR 0114(0042)]
Ah! But there was something else I needed to\ncheck with you...\c\nWould you mind showing me your Tera Orb,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0042)]
Hmm, I thought as much. It’s behaving just like\nKieran’s and Carmine’s orbs...[VAR 0114(0042)]
I think it might be because your orbs were\ndirectly exposed to the energy from Terapagos.[VAR 0114(0042)]
Kieran and Carmine say that ever since the\nunderdepths, they’ve been able to Terastallize\r\ntheir Pokémon without charging their Tera Orbs.[VAR 0114(0042)]
Actually, there’s one more piece of news I should\nshare with you related to those deepest depths![VAR 0114(0042)]
You know the Terarium Core that hangs from the\nceiling of the Terarium?[VAR 0114(0042)]
Well, until now, I’d been keeping it topped up\nwith a mixture of Paldean soil and water from\r\nthe Crystal Pool in Kitakami.[VAR 0114(0042)]
That’s how we’ve been able to stabilize the\nTerastal phenomenon on our academy grounds.[VAR 0114(0042)]
But the other day, I tried adding crystals I’d\ncollected from the underdepths to that mix—and\r\nit caused the properties of the core to change![VAR 0114(0042)]
The result? Pokémon shining in rainbow colors\nhave started appearing all over the Terarium!\r\nAnd they have the Stellar Tera Type![VAR 0114(0042)]
Thanks to this, my research into the Terastal\nphenomenon is shining brighter than ever![VAR 0114(0042)]
Oh, and there was one last thing...\c\nA man in a blue suit was looking for you over by\nthe entrance to the academy.[VAR 0114(0042)]
That’s all I have to report for now! Thanks for\nsetting aside some time to chat.[VAR 0114(0042)]
I’m off to pay a visit to my publisher, so I’ll leave\nyou to it.\c\nNext time we meet, I’ll ask you for a good long\nlook at Terapagos. Till then![VAR 0114(0042)]

That’s Sprigatito, a Grass-type Pokémon!\c\nIt can use its plant powers to soak up whatever\nwater you throw at it![VAR 0114(0004)]
Would you like to go with our good Grass-type\nPokémon Sprigatito here?[VAR 0114(000A)]
Spurrrrrr!

That’s Fuecoco, a Fire-type Pokémon!\c\nThe burning-hot sparks it scatters will fry any\nand all plants in a flash![VAR 0114(0004)]
Would you like to go with our good Fire-type\nPokémon Fuecoco here?[VAR 0114(000A)]

That’s Quaxly, a Water-type Pokémon!\c\nIt may seem quiet, but its mighty streams of\nwater can put out any fire—you’ll see![VAR 0114(0004)]

[VAR BD06(0000)][VAR 0101(0001)] seems to have taken quite\na\r\nliking\r\nto\r\nyou,\r\nM[VAR 1100(00FF,0305)]asteriss [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(000A)]
This is your first Pokémon, yes? Please raise it\nwith love and care.[VAR 0114(000A)]
And of course, be sure to keep it tucked safely\ninside a Poké Ball.[VAR 0114(000A)]
[VAR BD06(0000)][VAR 0100(0000)]... I can’t believe you\nactually\r\nchose [VAR 0101(0001)]...[VAR 0114(0004)]
I mean, like, way to make the perfect choice\nfor you! You two make such a good combo![VAR 0114(0004)]
Can I choose one of these Pokémon too,\nDirector Clavell?[VAR 0114(0004)]
Oh, but...did you not receive a Pokémon when\nyou entered the academy, Miss Nemona?[VAR 0114(000A)]
Not back then, no! I had other Pokémon I was\nfocused on raising at the time.[VAR 0114(0004)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]But now I want to raise a new Pokémon alongside\n[VAR 0100(0000)] while [VAR 1100(00FF,0100)]she raises h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]iser\r\nown\r\nnew partner![VAR 0114(0004)]
Indeed, a rather splendid idea.[VAR 0114(000A)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]If you wish to raise one of these Pokémon on\nequal footing with M[VAR 1100(00FF,0305)]asteriss\r\n[VAR 0100(0000)]\r\nhere,\r\nI shall\r\nbe\r\nmore\r\nthan\r\nhappy\r\nto\r\nallow it.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Yesss![VAR 0114(0004)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Since [VAR 0100(0000)] chose\n[VAR 0101(0001)],\r\nI’ll\r\ngo\r\nfor\r\nthis\r\nlittle one![VAR 0114(0004)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Nice to meet you, [VAR 0101(0002)]! Welcome to\nthe team![VAR 0114(0004)]
Spurrrrrr!
Crawww!
Pump-pomp!
All right, then![VAR 0114(0004)]
Now that we’ve chosen our Pokémon, we HAVE\nto battle![VAR 0114(0004)]
I’ll be waiting for you down at the beach.\nCome join me when you’re ready![VAR 0114(0004)]
As you may have noticed, Miss Nemona is a tad\noverly fond of Pokémon battling.[VAR 0114(000A)]
But I do hope you’ll join her for a battle. It will\nhelp you get to know your own Pokémon as well.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Miss Nemona was hoping you would join her at\nthe beach, wasn’t she? She’d be ever so happy\r\nif you agreed to a battle with her.[VAR 0114(000A)]

Over here![VAR 0114(0004)]
Anyone can be a Pokémon Trainer as long as\nthey have Pokémon by their side![VAR 0114(0004)]
And it’s our duty as Trainers to help our Pokémon\ngrow stronger through battle![VAR 0114(0004)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]So, you ready to battle me,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0004)]
Oye! Don’t get cold feet on me now! I wanna see\nwhat you’ve got![VAR 0114(0004)]
Perfecto! I’m so excited! For this battle,\nI think I’ll use—[VAR 0114(0004)]
Miss Nemona.[VAR 0114(000A)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]I trust you remember that M[VAR 1100(00FF,0305)]asteriss\n[VAR 0100(0000)]\r\nis\r\nwholly\r\ninexperienced\r\nin\r\nPokémon battling?[VAR 0114(000A)]
Heh, whoops... Good call, Director.\c\nI was about to send out one of my usual partners\nright off the bat...[VAR 0114(0004)]
I guess I’ll take this chance to try out my new\nbuddy instead![VAR 0114(0004)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]C’mon, [VAR 0100(0000)]! Let’s have us\na\r\nfruitful\r\nbattle![VAR 0114(0004)]
Look at you, winning your first battle ever!\nYou’ve got even more potential than I thought!\r\nYou’re gonna be a strong Trainer for sure![VAR 0114(0004)]
Hey, if you can battle like that on your first try,\nyou definitely have what it takes to be a Trainer![VAR 0114(0004)]
But now I want to try a different strategy!\nLet’s go again—just one more battle![VAR 0114(0004)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]M[VAR 1100(00FF,0305)]asteriss [VAR 0100(0000)] and h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]iser\n[VAR 0101(0001)]\r\nare\r\nsurely\r\nweary\r\nalready\r\nfrom\r\nthat\r\nlast battle.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Ah, sorry! I got kinda caught up in all the\nexcitement...[VAR 0114(0004)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]I’m really sorry, [VAR 0100(0000)].\nSame\r\nto\r\nyour\r\n[VAR 0101(0001)], too.[VAR 0114(0004)]
Don’t worry about it
Let’s battle again soon!
[VAR BD06(0000)]Heh... All right!\nThanks, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0004)]
Oh, definitely! We’ll definitely battle more![VAR 0114(0004)]
You two seem to be becoming fast friends,\nthough you’ve only just met.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Can I count on you to take your new schoolmate\nhere under your wing, Miss Nemona?\c\nI’m sure [VAR 1100(00FF,0100)]she can learn a great deal from a\nChampion-ranked Trainer, such as yourself.[VAR 0114(000A)]
You bet, sir![VAR 0114(0004)]
Oh, that reminds me! Since you’re new to training\nPokémon, there’s an app you definitely need![VAR 0114(0004)]
You have a smartphone, right? Lemme see it\nfor a sec.[VAR 0114(0004)]
The [VAR FF00(0006)]Pokédex app[VAR FF00(0000)] was added to your\nRotom Phone!
The Pokédex will automatically register any\nPokémon you catch.[VAR 0114(0004)]
It’s a must-have for Pokémon Trainers!\c\nIt’s a super handy app! Our homeroom teacher,\nMr. Jacq, actually made it himself![VAR 0114(0004)]
Back in my day, we used ordinary paper and\nhandwritten notes to compile our Pokédexes.\r\nIt’s quite the age we live in now.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Oof! Filling out a Pokédex by hand? I can’t even\nimagine how much work that would take![VAR 0114(0004)]
Ohoho... No, I suppose you can’t.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Yet no matter how much the times may change,\nthe wonder of meeting new Pokémon never does.\r\nThat is a truly timeless pleasure.[VAR 0114(000A)]
And the more Pokémon that you encounter, the\nmore you’ll find yourself growing and changing.[VAR 0114(000A)]
I hope you will both work hard toward the goal\nof completing your own Pokédexes.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Now, Miss Nemona, I do still have a few matters\nto discuss with your parents.[VAR 0114(000A)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Could I depend on you to see M[VAR 1100(00FF,0305)]asteriss\n[VAR 0100(0000)]\r\nto\r\nthe academy?\c\nYou would be doing me quite the favor.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Of course! Leave it to me![VAR 0114(0004)]
Then I leave h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]imer in your capable hands.[VAR 0114(000A)]
All right, little one. It’s time you and I were\non our way.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Sprrr.
Fwaaa!
Omp...
Maybe I oughta make a little more time to work\non my Pokédex along with all my battling...[VAR 0114(0004)]
Oh! Right![VAR 0114(0004)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Speaking of Pokédexes,\n[VAR 0100(0000)],\r\nyou’ve\r\nprobably\r\nnever\r\ncaught\r\na\r\nwild\r\nPokémon, right?[VAR 0114(0004)]
I’ll show you the ropes before I take you to the\nacademy. Come with me![VAR 0114(0004)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Do be careful on the way to school,\nM[VAR 1100(00FF,0305)]asteriss [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(000A)]

I hear that Nemona here will be taking you\nto school?[VAR 0114(002B)]
That’s right, ma’am. Leave it to me![VAR 0114(0004)]
So you’ve already managed to make a friend![VAR 0114(002B)]
And I read about all the wonderful teachers\nyou’ll have looking after you at the school.\c\nPlus so many handy facilities you can use as much\nas you like![VAR 0114(002B)]
Add in your new friend, Nemona, and it sounds\nlike your school life is shaping up to be fantastic![VAR 0114(002B)]
Now, you’ll be staying in the school dorms, so I\nwant you to promise me you’ll eat proper meals.[VAR 0114(002B)]
Here’s a bit of spending money to start off with.\nI also packed a lunch for your first day![VAR 0114(002B)]
Oh! And maybe you’d better take these, too.[VAR 0114(002B)]
Use them on that precious little partner of yours,\nshould it get hurt in battle.[VAR 0114(002B)]
I know every day in your new life is going to be\nfull of exciting experiences, far from home.[VAR 0114(002B)]
Just try to savor them all—the good times and\nthe hard times, too![VAR 0114(002B)]
But if you ever want to come back home, you\nknow your bed is always ready for you.[VAR 0114(002B)]
Oh, all right then! You two had better be off,\nI suppose. Take care on the way to school![VAR 0114(002B)]
Your mother’s so nice, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0004)]

It’s the path that leads to adventure for you\nand me!\c\nOut here, things are different than in town.\nYou’re gonna see wild Pokémon out and about.\r\nThey’ll be on the path and in the grass and such![VAR 0114(0004)]
Get too close to one, and you’ll have to battle.\nBut you’ve got [VAR 0101(0001)] for that, right?[VAR 0114(0004)]
And if you want to try to catch a Pokémon,\nyou gotta use...[VAR 0114(0004)]
a good ol’ [VAR FF00(0006)]Poké Ball[VAR FF00(0000)]![VAR 0114(0004)]
I’ve got tons. Have a few![VAR 0114(0004)]

Nice! Defeating Pokémon in battle will help\n[VAR 0101(0001)] grow and get stronger![VAR 0114(0004)]
Next time, try throwing a Poké Ball when a\nPokémon’s riiight on the tip of being defeated.\r\nYou’ll have a decent chance at catching it then![VAR 0114(0004)]
Good call! If you know you can’t win a battle,\ntactical retreats are what’s up![VAR 0114(0004)]
When you’ve got the edge, though, you can try\ncatching the wild Pokémon in a Poké Ball![VAR 0114(0004)]
Hala! That was awesome! You caught the very\nfirst Pokémon you went for![VAR 0114(0004)]
I’m crummy when it comes to actually catching\nPokémon. Maybe YOU should give ME tips![VAR 0114(0004)]
Aw, you lost! Were you hesitating a little when it\ncame time to attack?[VAR 0114(0004)]
Sometimes seeing how strong you are will make\nwild Pokémon accept you. So don’t be shy—\r\nbattle hard and throw those Poké Balls![VAR 0114(0004)]
Anyway, have some more Poké Balls just in case.\nNot every catch works out![VAR 0114(0004)]
Weaken the Pokémon, then throw the Poké Ball!\nRemember that, and you’ll be fine![VAR 0114(0004)]
Now go battle those wild Pokémon and catch\nsome of ’em![VAR 0114(0004)]
Let’s meet back up at that lighthouse over there!\nYou can see our school from the top![VAR 0114(0004)]
If your Pokémon are getting tired out, I can heal\n’em for ya![VAR 0114(0004)]
Oh, and if you get real good at catching\nPokémon, gimme some advice! I’m not great at\r\nthe actual “throw the Poké Ball” part.[VAR 0114(0004)]

Whoa! What was that?![VAR 0114(0004)]
Go-ohhh...[VAR 0114(001D)]
I’ve never heard that kind of cry before! Could\nbe some strong Pokémon or something![VAR 0114(0004)]
I say we find whatever made that cry! Let’s take a\nlook around, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nJust be careful—there’s a kinda unsafe cave not\nfar from here, so steer clear!\c\nAnd I know your Rotom Phone can help keep you\nsafe, but watch your step by these cliffs anyway![VAR 0114(0004)]

Maybe it used up all its power?\c\nWhat is this Pokémon, anyway? It kinda looks\nlike a Cyclizar, but I’ve never seen one quite\r\nlike this before...[VAR 0114(0004)]
And now it looks so different from a minute ago.\nYou think it’s OK?[VAR 0114(0004)]
Hard to say
I don’t know
[VAR BD06(0000)]You can’t tell either, huh,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0004)]
Well, all that aside, I’m seriously glad to have\nyou back up here in one piece![VAR 0114(0004)]
Let’s exchange numbers so we can get in touch if\nwe somehow get separated again![VAR 0114(0004)]

Oh good! Looks like it perked up a little![VAR 0114(0004)]
Do you think this fella was the one making that\nmysterious cry we heard before?[VAR 0114(0004)]

Oh man, oh man, oh man! The more I look at this\nPokémon, the more mysterious it seems![VAR 0114(0004)]
If you do become its Trainer, you gotta let me\nbattle against it![VAR 0114(0004)]
You’ve both been through enough for a minute!\nI think we better take a breather.\c\nLet’s just get to the lighthouse—that’ll be a good\nspot to relax.[VAR 0114(0004)]

Wait, I know you... Aren’t you Arven?\nYou’re enrolled in the humanities track, right?[VAR 0114(0004)]

Doesn’t matter who my mom is![VAR 0114(0006)]
Doesn’t matter who my dad is![VAR 0114(0006)]
The real issue here is what in the world this\nPokémon is doing out here!\c\nAnd what is with this form it’s in?![VAR 0114(0006)]
I met it at the bottom of this cliff...
It saved me from a tight spot...
[VAR BD06(0000)]See, we heard this strange cry, and we tried to\ninvestigate, but [VAR 0100(0000)] fell\r\noff\r\na cliff...[VAR 0114(0004)]
That Pokémon saved h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]imer, but it seems like it\nwore itself out in the process. It got kinda...\r\nslumpy afterward.[VAR 0114(0004)]
But you shoulda seen it before! It looked totally\ndifferent—it was unbelievably strong![VAR 0114(0004)]
Well, yeah. As it should be. But it can’t fight\nwhile it’s like this.[VAR 0114(0006)]
The form [VAR 0101(0001)] takes in battle... That’s its\ntrue form.[VAR 0114(0006)]
[VAR 0101(0001)]? Is that this Pokémon’s name?\nHow’d you know it?[VAR 0114(0004)]

[VAR 0101(0001)] isn’t the sort of Pokémon that any\nold Trainer can hope to command. It’s special.[VAR 0114(0006)]

You think you’re up to ordering [VAR 0101(0001)]\naround? Then how ’bout I test your worthiness?[VAR 0114(0006)]
Heh! Well, look at you—quite the little go-getter![VAR 0114(0006)]
I’m saying I want to test you. You can’t just leave\nme hanging here![VAR 0114(0006)]
I’ve been feeling all out of sorts, so I’m gonna\nuse this battle to blast these doldrums away![VAR 0114(0006)]
Wow, [VAR 0100(0000)]! That was awesome![VAR 0114(0004)]
I guess I wasn’t ever going to stand a chance\nusing some Pokémon I’d only just caught...[VAR 0114(0006)]

Yeah, you’re in some serious trouble if you can’t\neven beat someone like me.\c\nI’d be worried about my future, if I were you.[VAR 0114(0006)]
But if you really think you can take [VAR 0101(0001)]\noff my hands for me...you’ll need this.[VAR 0114(0006)]
It’s the Poké Ball that brute’s been kept in.[VAR 0114(0006)]
[~ 41]
So why’d YOU have it?[VAR 0114(0004)]
Anyway, that thing’s your problem now, not mine.\nGood luck.[VAR 0114(0006)]
What? Oye! Can you not hear me or something?[VAR 0114(0004)]
Fine, be that way! But you better actually show\nup for school![VAR 0114(0004)]
What a weirdo...[VAR 0114(0004)]
That Arven guy definitely knows more than he’s\nletting on.[VAR 0114(0004)]
Next time, he and I are battling! I’m gonna wring\nsome answers outta him![VAR 0114(0004)]
But oh, right—we gotta climb the lighthouse!\nCan’t wait to show you the view of our school![VAR 0114(0004)]

Oyeee! Up here! Come on![VAR 0114(0004)]
Look, [VAR 0100(0000)]! That’s Mesagoza![VAR 0114(0004)]
And that huge building with the Poké Ball on it\nis our school![VAR 0114(0004)]
It’s gonna be so great having you in the same\nclass, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0004)]
I’m looking forward to it!
But all that schoolwork...
Right? I can’t wait to get back. We’re gonna get\nto learn so much...and battle so, so, SO much![VAR 0114(0004)]
Don’t think of it as schoolwork—think of it as\ntons of chances to learn about Pokémon battling![VAR 0114(0004)]
Isn’t it awesome what you can see from up here?[VAR 0114(0004)]
Mountains! Forests! Grasslands! Beautiful nature\nstuff, as far as the eye can see![VAR 0114(0004)]
And you know what’s waiting for you all over\nthese natural spaces? Tons of Pokémon![VAR 0114(0004)]
Consider this me officially telling you:\nwelcome to Paldea![VAR 0114(0004)]

But anyway, like you can see, it’s kind of a hike\nto get to school from here.[VAR 0114(0004)]
Let’s make it to Los Platos for starters.\nThat’s right on the way![VAR 0114(0004)]
Vamos! C’mon![VAR 0114(0004)]

Text File : common_0210
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Oye, [VAR 0100(0000)]! Over here![VAR 0114(0004)]
This here’s a Pokémon Center![VAR 0114(0004)]
You can come here to take care of a lot of things\nrelated to your Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0004)]
But I’ll leave the explanations to the pros here.[VAR 0114(0004)]
Happy to be of service—and welcome to the\nPokémon Center!
I’m here to keep everyone’s Pokémon healthy.
And this to my right is the Technical Machine\nMachine—TM Machine for short!
It’s your ticket to making TMs, which you can use\nto teach moves to your Pokémon.
You’ll need to pay in [VAR FF00(0006)]LP[VAR FF00(0000)] and supply the machine\nwith [VAR FF00(0006)]materials[VAR FF00(0000)] that Pokémon drop.
LP comes in handy both at these machines and at\nstores! I’ve got a lot—here, have some![VAR 0114(0004)]
Oh yeah, and some of these too![VAR 0114(0004)]
You received lots of Pokémon [VAR FF00(0008)]materials [VAR FF00(0000)]from\nNemona!
Here on my left is the Poké Mart counter! You\ncan buy things like Poké Balls and Potions.
Hello! We accept payment both in cash and in\n[VAR FF00(0006)]LP[VAR FF00(0000)]—[VAR FF00(0006)]League Points[VAR FF00(0000)], that is. One LP is worth 1!
And at the Union Circle, you can connect\nwith other Trainers to find yourself some\r\nadventuring companions!
Come visit us at the Pokémon Center anytime\nyou need any help!
We will. Thanks![VAR 0114(0004)]
Remember: “Had a rough adventure?\nGet to the Pokémon Center!”\c\nSometimes you have to know this sort of stuff for\nquizzes at school.[VAR 0114(0004)]
But mnemonics help out! Here’s another one:\n“[VAR FF00(0006)]‘R’ you ready?[VAR FF00(0000)] Then [VAR FF00(0006)]Let’s Go[VAR FF00(0000)]!”\c\nGoofy, sure, but it helps you remember you can\n[VAR FF00(0006)]send your lead Pokémon out with the R Button[VAR FF00(0000)]![VAR 0114(0004)]
That way, you can have the Pokémon that’s\nwalking with you go pick up items lying around\r\nor go battle on its own or other stuff like that![VAR 0114(0004)]
Now, time to go. Once we leave Los Platos, we’ll\nhit the best-known spot in the South Province’s\r\nArea One: the massive hill on the way to school!\c\nYou’ll usually find Trainers there who are just\nitching to battle. Good luck![VAR 0114(0004)]

[~ 18]
Oyeee! [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0004)]
[~ 18]
Didja battle some Trainers on the hill? Bet your\nPokémon [VAR 1101(00FD,0302)]isare getting stronger![VAR 0114(0004)]
How about you show me how much you [VAR 1101(00FD,0303)]twoall have\nlearned...in a battle?[VAR 0114(0004)]
Sure thing!
I don’t know...
All right! Nothing like having a friend around![VAR 0114(0004)]
If you’re not sure, all the more reason to give it\na shot! A nice battle will help us get to know\r\neach other better, too![VAR 0114(0004)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Come on, [VAR 0100(0000)]! Let’s have\nus a\r\nfruitful\r\nbattle![VAR 0114(0004)]
Amazing! Look at you, taking on a [VAR FF00(0006)]Terastallized[VAR FF00(0000)]\nopponent and winning, no problem![VAR 0114(0004)]
Come to think of it, you can’t Terastallize your\nPokémon yet, huh?\c\nDon’t worry—I’ll get you taken care of![VAR 0114(0004)]
You’re so good with Pokémon battles, I forget\nhow new you are to this stuff sometimes![VAR 0114(0004)]
I guess the hill wore you out a bit, huh? Still,\neven if I did take the win this time, your moves\r\nweren’t bad. Not bad at all![VAR 0114(0004)]
Anyway, it was fun to battle you! Here, have\nsome Revives as thanks![VAR 0114(0004)]
Now, Mesagoza’s waiting just past this gate!\nAt last, the city where our school is![VAR 0114(0004)]
There’s a ton of hills and stairs and stuff in the\ncity, so I’m gonna take a quick breather and then\r\ncatch up with you soon![VAR 0114(0004)]
[~ 18]

All right, here I am! We finally made it, huh?[VAR 0114(0004)]
This is Mesagoza! The biggest city in Paldea![VAR 0114(0004)]
It’s been a big trade hub since a long time ago.\c\nLots of folks come here to learn about advances\nin technology and all kinds of other stuff.[VAR 0114(0004)]
There’s a hair salon where you can change your\nlook, plus places with tasty food and fixings...[VAR 0114(0004)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]What do you want to see first,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0004)]
The hair salon!
Tasty food!
Oh, you’re a fashionista, are you?\c\nOr maybe you just want a practical ’do that won’t\nget in your eyes when you’re battling![VAR 0114(0004)]
Hah! I didn’t have you pegged for a big eater!\c\nBut that’s smart. You can’t battle well with a\ngrowling tummy, right?[VAR 0114(0004)]
Oh, and speaking of battling...[VAR 0114(0004)]
I wanna be sure you’ll be able to Terastallize\nyour Pokémon too, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0004)]
There’s a few things that gotta get done for that\nto happen, but I’ll take care of ’em![VAR 0114(0004)]
Meanwhile, you just have fun looking around the\ncity a bit![VAR 0114(0004)]
There’s so much to do—grab a bite, buy some\naccessories to spice up your uniform...[VAR 0114(0004)]
If you want my personal recommendation, you’ve\ngotta see Delibird Presents! They sell handy\r\nitems for Pokémon to hold.[VAR 0114(0004)]
Once you’ve seen your fill, we can meet up again\nin front of the school!\c\nJust...be ready. The stairs up to school are\nno joke.[VAR 0114(0004)]
Later, then! Get pumped for some Terastallizing![VAR 0114(0004)]

Don’t you get it?! If you join Team Star, you can\nshine as bright as anybody![VAR 0114(002D)]
... ... ...[VAR 0114(002C)]
Seriously, what’s with you? Don’t you wanna\nburn bright with awesome friends like us?[VAR 0114(002E)]
...Not really.[VAR 0114(002C)]
Look—we’ve got a quota we’re supposed to fill\nfor new members, so just sign up already![VAR 0114(002D)]
Um... I’d rather not...[VAR 0114(002C)]
Help her out
Walk away
Huh? You want in on this, too?[VAR 0114(002E)]
If you’re here to sign up, we’ll get to you next!\nWe’ve nearly got this one in the bag![VAR 0114(002E)]
We’re Team Star, kid. We burn so bright, it hurts\nto look at us! But you knew that, right?[VAR 0114(002D)]
So you know exactly who you’re messing with,\nand you’re still coming at us with that attitude?\c\nYou’re scary, kid. If you joined Team Star, you’d\nbe looking down from the top in no time![VAR 0114(002D)]
Ugh, another ignorant little nobody...\c\nHere I’m finally part of Team Star, and still I get\nno respect? I gotta work my way up the ranks...[VAR 0114(002D)]
Hey—we can’t just let something like this slide!\c\nThe honor of our team’s on the line, so we’ve got\nno real choice but to battle, yeah?[VAR 0114(002E)]
That’s true! You keep watch on that little four-\neyes over there![VAR 0114(002D)]
I’ll make sure this fresh-faced nobody ends up\nseeing stars![VAR 0114(002D)]
Urk, why’s a nobody like you so good at battling,\nanyway? That’s just not right...[VAR 0114(002D)]
No way, [VAR 1100(00FF,0100)]she beat you?![VAR 0114(002E)]
Does that mean I gotta battle this kid now since\nI’m higher up Team Star’s ranks?![VAR 0114(002E)]
Pero bueno! What do you think you’re doing?![VAR 0114(0004)]
Ugh! It’s that student council dweeb![VAR 0114(002D)]
She’s gonna report us if we don’t book it...[VAR 0114(002E)]
I can’t believe you, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0004)]
You don’t have to go find randos to battle! You’ll\nhave all the battles you’ll ever need...with me![VAR 0114(0004)]
That’s really not what happened...
It was those Team Star punks...
Wait—THEY picked a fight with YOU? Wow, I\nread that way wrong! Sorry![VAR 0114(0004)]
I get it now. You two have got Team Star written\nall over you for sure!\c\nI bet you were trying to pressure people into\nsigning up again, weren’t you?[VAR 0114(0004)]
Ah, hi. We weren’t...not doing that.[VAR 0114(002E)]
Well, that explains it.\c\nAs head of the student council, stopping this\ntype of nonsense would normally be MY job...[VAR 0114(0004)]
But this is also the perfect chance for you to try\nmy amazing and ultra-rare gift to you![VAR 0114(0004)]
With this Tera Orb, you can [VAR FF00(0006)]Terastallize[VAR FF00(0000)] your\nPokémon during battle![VAR 0114(0004)]
Let’s see. After it Terastallizes, I’m pretty sure\nyour [VAR 0101(0001)] will beee...[VAR 1302(0002,0000)][VAR 0103(0002)] type![VAR 0114(0004)]
Normally you’ve gotta take special classes to be\nable to get one of these Tera Orbs, but I put in\r\na good word for you![VAR 0114(0004)]
Now, time to give it a whirl! You’ll learn to use it\nfaster in battle than if I just explain it to you![VAR 0114(0004)]
Wait, what? You want this kid to practice whaling\non us with h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]iser Tera Pokémon, is that it?[VAR 0114(002E)]
Got a problem? You wanna battle me instead?[VAR 0114(0004)]
Hnnng... Never mind! I’ll take my chances with\nthe new kid![VAR 0114(002E)]
Then take your places, and...battle![VAR 0114(0004)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Nice, [VAR 0100(0000)]! You pulled\noff\r\nTerastallizing\r\nno problem![VAR 0114(0004)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Nice, [VAR 0100(0000)]! You didn’t\neven\r\nhave\r\nto\r\nbother\r\nTerastallizing\r\nyour Pokémon![VAR 0114(0004)]
Moves of your Pokémon’s Tera Type will hit even\nharder when it’s Terastallized, y’know![VAR 0114(0004)]
Sometimes you’ll find a Pokémon whose Tera\nType is totally different from its usual type. That\r\ndifference can open up your strategic options!\c\nGotta charge your Tera Orb at a Pokémon Center\nafter every use by healing up your team, though.[VAR 0114(0004)]
W-well... I’ll be on my merry way, then, yeah?\nHasta la vistaaarrr! ☆[VAR 0114(002E)]
Me, too! Hasta la vistar! ☆[VAR 0114(002D)]
So, yeah—Team Star is basically a group of\nstudents that like to kick up trouble.[VAR 0114(0004)]
They hardly ever show up to class, and when they\nget together in groups, they’re a real headache.\c\nEven the teachers don’t know what to do with\n’em, from what I hear...[VAR 0114(0004)]
Um...’scuse me![VAR 0114(002C)]
I...uh... I just... Well, thanks.[VAR 0114(002C)]
So, yeah... See you around.[VAR 0114(002C)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Awww, look at you, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nAlready\r\nbecoming\r\na big\r\nhero\r\naround campus![VAR 0114(0004)]
I don’t think I’ve seen that girl around. Maybe\nshe’s a new transfer, like you...\c\nThat Eevee bag, though! Love that fluff![VAR 0114(0004)]
Anyway, seems like the trouble’s died down, so\nwe’d better book it up to school!\c\nGet ready to climb the worst staircase in\nthe world![VAR 0114(0004)]

You can sign up for all kinds of classes at the\ndesk behind me, and those halls off to the sides\r\nlead to all different parts of the school.[VAR 0114(0004)]
It’s totally big enough to let loose and battle in\nhere, but for some reason, they banned Pokémon\r\nbattling in the main entrance...[VAR 0114(0004)]

We had a blast!

I imagine Miss Nemona’s high spirits helped with\nthat. She’s a true asset to our fine academy.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Oh dear, was it really? I suppose Miss Nemona\nmust have led you on quite the adventure...[VAR 0114(000A)]
Not that I was expecting any less from our\nChampion-ranked student council president.\r\nReliable as ever, Miss Nemona.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Well, I know how to look after my friends!\nRight, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0004)]
Oh! But speaking of which...we saw some of\nthose Team Star kids in town, Director![VAR 0114(0004)]
You did?! Where?![VAR 0114(000A)]
It was down the stairs from the front gates. They\nwere hassling this kid with an Eevee backpack...[VAR 0114(0004)]
That is quite the news. Are they still to be found\nout there?[VAR 0114(000A)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Actually, [VAR 0100(0000)] flexed\non ’em\r\nand ran\r\n’em off.[VAR 0114(0004)]

Of course it’s a fine thing to try to help a fellow\nstudent, M[VAR 1100(00FF,0305)]asteriss [VAR 0100(0000)]...\c\nBut you might wish to show a bit of restraint as\nyou find your feet here at our academy.[VAR 0114(000A)]
And, Miss Nemona, do remember that the\nschool’s staff is here to resolve any such troubles.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Uh... Right! Yes sir, Director![VAR 0114(0004)]
A child with an Eevee backpack, you say...\nI suppose that might have been Miss Penny.\r\nI’m relieved to hear she’s come to class, at least.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Ah, and Miss Nemona? If you’d be so good, do\nreport to Mr. Jacq about this Team Star business.\c\nAs your homeroom teacher, he should be kept\napprised of all such goings-on.[VAR 0114(000A)]

Ah, but look at the time. You two had better\nhurry along—classes will be starting soon.[VAR 0114(000A)]

What’s your favorite thing about Pokémon?
I like battling with Pokémon
I like collecting Pokémon
I like playing with my Pokémon
I like everything about Pokémon!
Really? Awesome! I’m totally the same!
Does anyone else have a question for their\nnew classmate?[VAR 0114(002A)]
Me! I have a question![VAR 0114(0004)]
You went to all the trouble of enrolling here, so\nspill, [VAR 0100(0000)]...[VAR 0114(0004)]
What do you hope to get out of it? You must\nhave some kind of dream, right?[VAR 0114(0004)]
I want to complete the Pokédex
I want to be a strong Trainer
I don’t actually know
I’m glad I got you set up with that Pokédex app if\nyou like collecting that much![VAR 0114(0004)]
You will be! Oh, I just know it! You and me—\nwe’re going to get so strong battling together![VAR 0114(0004)]
Fair, I get it! The possibilities are endless, right?\nWho can decide![VAR 0114(0004)]
Well, thank you for telling us a bit about\nyourself, [VAR 0100(0000)].\c\nI’m Mr. Jacq. I teach biology here at the\nacademy, and I’m also your homeroom teacher.[VAR 0114(002A)]

All right, you ragamuffins. Be nice and friendly\nto our new classmate![VAR 0114(002A)]
We will, Mr. Jacq!
Get to know the academy campus by exploring a\nbit on your own!
Yo, new kid! Glad to have you!
When class is in session, we tend to be on our\nbest behavior. But our best still isn’t that good!
Wh-what, you want to talk to me?!
Thanks for answering my question earlier!
Welcome to the academy!
Looking for Nemona? She got called to the staff\nroom just now.

I ask each of you to set out and travel the world\nin search of your own treasure.[VAR 0114(000A)]
You have all learned much within the walls of our\nfine academy...[VAR 0114(000A)]
But now it is time to turn your eyes upon the\nwider world and deepen your understanding.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Explore Paldea’s abundant nature, soak in its\nrich culture...[VAR 0114(000A)]
discover the Pokémon that live here...[VAR 0114(000A)]
and get to know the people, too.[VAR 0114(000A)]

You could try to beat Pokémon Gyms, you could\nhelp out people in need... You could hunt for\r\nreal capital-T treasure if you wanted, even![VAR 0114(0004)]

Where should I start?
[VAR BD06(0000)]Excellent answer. Much obliged, Champion\n[VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0011)]
To get straight to it, I would like you to go out\nand inspect Paldea’s various Gyms in my stead.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Are they fulfilling their duties as beacons of\nstrength and inspiration for all those aiming\r\nto achieve Champion Rank?\c\nOr has their brilliance started to fade?[VAR 0114(0011)]
To find this out, I ask that you bring your full\nmight as Champion to bear against each of the\r\nGym Leaders and test their prowess in battle.[VAR 0114(0011)]
They are all Trainers of exceptional talent,\nhandpicked by me personally.\c\nI do not expect you’ll find any cracks in their\narmor, but...well. Consider it a formality.[VAR 0114(0011)]
This will also provide the perfect stage for your\nfirst appearance as a new Champion.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Since all the Gym Leaders will still be expecting\nme to carry out the inspection, I imagine they’ll\r\nhave mustered their full strength.\c\nI daresay they might be more of a challenge than\nwhen you faced them before.[VAR 0114(0011)]
You get to have all-out battles with the Gym\nLeaders?! Man, I’m jealous...[VAR 0114(0004)]
Now then, on to another crucial matter.\c\nI’d like to discuss with Penny here how to patch\nthe weaknesses in our League Point system.[VAR 0114(0011)]

Gah—I mean...I’ll d-do it. I’ll help. Let me help.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Excellent. We’ll leave you all to it, then. Come\nnow, Penny.[VAR 0114(0011)]
This is awesome, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nShow this inspection thing who’s boss so that\nLa Primera can join our tournament, OK?\c\nAnd enjoy taking another swing at the Gym\ngauntlet while you’re at it![VAR 0114(0004)]
I’ll take care of filling out the forms and other\nadministrative stuff so the ball gets rolling on the\r\ntournament in the meantime![VAR 0114(0004)]
I say, it’s wonderful to see you all showing such\ninitiative. You each have a critical role to play.\c\nPenny assisting the League, our new Champion\ninspecting Gyms, Nemona arranging the event...\r\nGive it your best, everyone![VAR 0114(000A)]

Hey, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0004)]

Oh yeah—that’s what we decided to officially\nname the tournament! It’s a good name, right?\r\nFitting, memorable?[VAR 0114(0004)]
But then Arven went and said we should call it\nthe “School Battle Brawl”...[VAR 0114(0004)]
And then even Director Clavell got into calling it\nthat, so now I’m just like...agh![VAR 0114(0004)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Anyway, how you feelin’, [VAR 0100(0000)]?\nIn the\r\nmindset\r\nto do\r\nsome winning?[VAR 0114(0004)]

You’ve gotta go through the application process\nwith a staffer before you can actually participate\r\nin the tournament![VAR 0114(0004)]
Ready for that explanation now, mister![VAR 0114(0004)]
All right. The rules of the Academy Ace\nTournament are as follows:\c\nAny student or faculty member of the academy\nmay enter. Your opponents will be random, and\r\nonly winners will advance to the next round!
Opponents will be matched by lottery, and the\nlottery is run by the people in charge.
That means you’ll have no idea who you’ll be\nfacing until you meet them on the battle court!
Winners, as I said, will get to advance to the\nnext round.
But lose once, and you’re knocked out—no more\nbattles for you after that.
The last Trainer standing—the only person to win\nall their matches—will be deemed the best of all,\r\nthe academy’s ace!
Thanks very much![VAR 0114(0004)]
We hashed out the tournament rules with help\nfrom Director Clavell.[VAR 0114(0004)]
Based on the number of entrants so far, you’d\nprobably have to win four times to take it all![VAR 0114(0004)]
Don’t forget you might go up against the faculty,\ntoo. They’re tough stuff...so good luck and go be\r\neven tougher![VAR 0114(0004)]
The only person allowed to beat you is me![VAR 0114(0004)]
Please talk to me when you’re ready to take part.

All right! Let’s jump right into the first round,\neveryone! Who will the fates pair up today?!
[VAR BD06(0000)]Champion [VAR 0100(0000)] will\nbe facing...
Arven, from class 2-G!
You’ve got to be kidding me. Up against my little\nChampion buddy right from the first round...[VAR 0114(0006)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]So how about it, [VAR 0100(0000)]! Bet\nyou’re\r\nsurprised\r\nto\r\nsee\r\nme\r\nin\r\nthis\r\ntournament, right?![VAR 0114(0006)]
Heheh... Yeah, that’s right! That dumbfounded\nexpression is what I wanted to see![VAR 0114(0006)]
Wait, you actually thought I would sign up for\nthis thing? Boy, I guess you really do get me...\r\nNo wonder we’re best buds![VAR 0114(0006)]
See, when we went down into Area Zero, it really\ndrove home for me how I need to get stronger.[VAR 0114(0006)]
So I’ve been off doing some special super-\nserious training with Mabosstiff and my team![VAR 0114(0006)]
If we ever end up in trouble again, I want to be\nthere fighting beside you—on the same level.[VAR 0114(0006)]
So today I’m here to WIN! Even if it might only\nbe by a stroke of luck![VAR 0114(0006)]
Get a taste of this! Arven’s here with some spicy\nnew flavor for you![VAR 0114(0006)]
And the winner of this first-round battle is...\nChampion [VAR 0100(0000)]!
Whoo! All right! That professor’s kid put up a\nheck of a fight!
What a spicy start! And that’s only the first match!
Phew, the strength of a Champion is legit! It hurts\nto lose, but I’m proud of you, little buddy![VAR 0114(0006)]
Maybe I should think about going around to all\nthose Gyms myself sometime...[VAR 0114(0006)]
You’d better try just as hard as I would’ve in\nround two, for me![VAR 0114(0006)]

Next up is the second round! I’m sure you’re\nready to hear the matchup, so let’s get to it!
[VAR BD06(0000)]Champion [VAR 0100(0000)] will\nbe facing...

Hello, hello, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(002A)]
I hear you went out on your Treasure Hunt and\nwound up becoming a Champion.[VAR 0114(002A)]
That’s quite the achievement![VAR 0114(002A)]
I guess I’m the homeroom teacher for two\nChampion Rank students now.[VAR 0114(002A)]
I won’t lie—I’m feeling a wee bit of pressure\nhere![VAR 0114(002A)]
I’ve got to work hard so my students don’t\noutshine me too much, huh?[VAR 0114(002A)]
Well, then! Let’s get started, shall we?[VAR 0114(002A)]
Here’s hoping I do OK![VAR 0114(002A)]
And the winner of this second-round battle is...\nChampion [VAR 0100(0000)]!
Hehe. You beat me! You’re quite the strong\nTrainer, aren’t you, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(002A)]
You’re more fit for the teaching profession than I\nam with that boundless confidence of yours![VAR 0114(002A)]
Mr. Jacq! Did I hear you correctly just now?![VAR 0114(000A)]
Uh-oh. Uh... Hi, Director. Are you angry with me?\nHehe...[VAR 0114(002A)]
Well, I’m going to go get yelled at. Good luck in\nthe coming battles![VAR 0114(002A)]

Finally, only four Trainers remain! Time for our\ncontestants to face their third matches, everyone!
The matchup for this battle will be Champion\n[VAR 0100(0000)] versus...
Dendra, the battle studies teacher!
Osu! New kid![VAR 0114(0024)]
This “School Battle Brawl” is for deciding the\nstrongest Trainer in the academy, right?\c\nMan, I’m so pumped up!!![VAR 0114(0024)]
There’s no better place for me to show off\nmy strengths![VAR 0114(0024)]
And I hear you’re the reason we’re having this\ntournament? You have my thanks for that![VAR 0114(0024)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]New kid—no, Champion\n[VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0024)]
As a teacher, I feel like it’s my duty to lead my\nstudents to success.[VAR 0114(0024)]
BUT! Since I AM the battle studies teacher here,\nI can’t very well lose in a battle, can I?![VAR 0114(0024)]
So don’t expect me to go easy on you! I’m going\nto give it all I’ve got![VAR 0114(0024)]
And the winner of this third-round battle is...\nChampion [VAR 0100(0000)]!
No way! I got crushed![VAR 0114(0024)]
But I still got something great out of this battle!\nThis was a massive chance for me to grow![VAR 0114(0024)]
You may be surprised to hear this, but we adults\nare still learning every day, too.[VAR 0114(0024)]
That’s why we’re always harping on you kids to\nstudy! Turns out we actually DO know what we’re\r\ntalking about![VAR 0114(0024)]
Thanks for the battle! Keep aiming for the top in\nthis tournament, and don’t forget...\r\nOsu! Osu! Osu![VAR 0114(0024)]

There’s one last match in this tournament, ladies\nand gentlemen...\c\nAllow me to introduce the two Trainers who’ll\nbe facing off to finally determine who’s strongest\r\nin the academy!
It’s Champion [VAR 0100(0000)] up against...
a special guest joining our tournament, the Top\nChampion, Geeta!
Good day, Champion [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0011)]
I had a feeling I would meet you in the finals.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Honed strength against honed strength...[VAR 0114(0011)]
Such a clash is what captures the crowd...and\nmakes their hearts race.[VAR 0114(0011)]
This is extremely close to what I would call my\nideal world.[VAR 0114(0011)]
As the chairperson for both the Pokémon League\nand the academy...[VAR 0114(0011)]
I find this situation to be incredibly satisfying.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Now, if we both push each other to greater\nheights, we will achieve greater synergy.[VAR 0114(0011)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Come, Champion [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nOur battle\r\nwill\r\ninspire\r\nall\r\nthose\r\nwho\r\nwatch\r\nus\r\ntoday![VAR 0114(0011)]
Let me show you the full might of the Top\nChampion![VAR 0114(0011)]
U-unbelievable, ladies and gentlemen...\nThe victor of this tournament...
and thus the strongest Trainer in the whole\nacademy is...Champion [VAR 0100(0000)]!
WOOOOOOOOOOOO!
[VAR 0100(0000)]! You did it! You DID it![VAR 0114(0004)]

I would like to extend my thanks to everyone who\nmade this extraordinary tournament possible.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Each and every Trainer demonstrated beautifully\nthe bond they share with their Pokémon.\r\nI couldn’t take my eyes off any of the matches![VAR 0114(000A)]
“Taking lessons from tradition—growing stronger\nand greater.”[VAR 0114(000A)]
“Leading the way into the future—while valuing\nour individuality.”[VAR 0114(000A)]
That is our motto at Naranja Academy... And the\ntournament truly lived up to our ideals![VAR 0114(000A)]
That is our motto at Uva Academy... And the\ntournament truly lived up to our ideals![VAR 0114(000A)]
Now, I’m aware my speeches tend to get a little,\nshall we say, overlong, so I’ll wrap it up there.[VAR 0114(000A)]
I now turn the floor over to our special guest,\nChairwoman Geeta.[VAR 0114(000A)]
The friendly rivalry of the Trainers... The cheering\nand encouragement from the crowd...[VAR 0114(0011)]
I feel like these are the perfect ingredients for\nthe academy—[VAR 0114(0011)]
no, for the whole Paldea region to become more\nlively and energized![VAR 0114(0011)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Champion [VAR 0100(0000)] was far\nstronger\r\ntoday\r\nthan\r\nwhen\r\n[VAR 1100(00FF,0100)]she\r\ntook\r\nthe\r\nPokémon\r\nLeague’s\r\nfinal test...[VAR 0114(0011)]
It is clear that [VAR 1100(00FF,0100)]she strives to become better every\nday, even after reaching such an esteemed rank![VAR 0114(0011)]
It is my sincere hope that all Paldea’s people will\nbe inspired not just by h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]imer but by every Trainer\r\ngathered here who aimed for new heights...[VAR 0114(0011)]
and that the seeds for many more future\nChampions will be sown![VAR 0114(0011)]
I eagerly await news of all your achievements![VAR 0114(0011)]
Thank you, Chairwoman Geeta.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Now, alas, it is time for this wonderful tournament\nto come to an end...\c\nBUT![VAR 0114(000A)]
This event seems to me to be a wonderful way to\nbuild rapport between faculty and students and\r\ninvigorate the wider community beyond our walls.\c\nSo...[VAR 0114(000A)]
I hereby declare that the Academy Ace\nTournament will not end as a one-time event\r\nand will continue to be held regularly![VAR 0114(000A)]
Wooo! Awesome! Director Clavell, you’re the\nbest!
Maybe I’ll join next time, too!
Oh my gosh, YES! This is everything I wanted![VAR 0114(0004)]
I do hope you’ll participate next time,\nMiss Nemona.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Absolutely! I wouldn’t miss it for anything![VAR 0114(0004)]
Well, dear students and staff, that wraps up our\nvery first Academy Ace Tournament.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Thank you again for joining us here today, and I\nhope you’re all excited for the next one![VAR 0114(000A)]

You remember me, right?[VAR 0114(0006)]
Oh, from the lighthouse!
I don’t think we’ve met...
Yeah, exactly! That’s my little know-it-all buddy!\nGot a mind like a steel trap, eh?[VAR 0114(0006)]
What?! Come on, I gave you [VAR 0101(0001)]’s\nPoké Ball! Did I forget to introduce myself...?[VAR 0114(0006)]

I normally wouldn’t even bother showing up for\nclass, but I came all the way to school today\r\njust to talk with you—our new celebrity.[VAR 0114(0006)]
You’ve gotta help me out so I can finally make\nmy dream a reality![VAR 0114(0006)]

What’s this dream, first?
What kind of little maniac says yes to something\nwithout even knowing what they’re agreeing to?![VAR 0114(0006)]
Hehehe... Caught your interest, have I? You want\nto hear all about my dream, right?[VAR 0114(0006)]
Well, this might come as a surprise, but fact is,\nI’m all about that picnic life: the great outdoors,\r\nthe perfectly prepared sandwiches, all of it.\c\nNot half bad at cooking either, I can tell you.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Right now I’m researching new recipes that’ll help\nPokémon feel better. Real health food, see.[VAR 0114(0006)]
I found this book the other day, and it had a\nsection about these Herba Mystica things...[VAR 0114(0006)]
Basically, they’re some kind of special herbs that\nheal up any Pokémon as soon as it eats them![VAR 0114(0006)]
Now, there are a total of five different types of\nHerba Mystica, based on what I read.\c\nJust taking a little lick of them once they’ve been\npowdered will get your blood flowing, provide\r\nnutrients, prevent aging—it’ll even boost the\r\nimmune system![VAR 0114(0006)]
These herbs seem like they’re the real deal.\nOnly found here in Paldea—and rare to boot![VAR 0114(0006)]
But this book says they’re all guarded by Titan\nPokémon, meaning that it’s gonna be pretty\r\ntough to try to grab even a few sprigs.[VAR 0114(0006)]
’Cause, see, Titans are— Well, I think they’ve\ngotta be...things like this![VAR 0114(0006)]
I really want to get those herbs for myself, but...\nI’m not very good at Pokémon battles.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Don’t have any friends with strong Pokémon to\nlend me a hand, either...\c\nAnd I’d never hear the end of it if I went crawling\nto that student council girl...[VAR 0114(0006)]
But here you waltz up! You’ve got to help me out\nwith this—you’d be perfect![VAR 0114(0006)]
Nope! Wait! I don’t need an answer yet![VAR 0114(0006)]
I’ll just register the places where it seems there\nmight be Titans in your map app for you.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Let it stew a bit, and we can get more into the\ndetails later. And in the meantime...take this.\r\nA little gift for listening and all.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Give the idea some serious thought! Please![VAR 0114(0006)]

It’s this book full of crazy stories and legends\nand things—stuff nobody’d usually believe.[VAR 0114(0006)]
But I believe it! I think what it says is true![VAR 0114(0006)]
And according to this book, eating all five Herba\nMystica can cure anything that ails you![VAR 0114(0006)]
Case in point, Mabosstiff’s paws were cold as ice\nbefore he ate that last herb. But they’ve warmed\r\nup a little now—I’m sure they have![VAR 0114(0006)]
... ... ...
Oh! You done eating, bud?[VAR 0114(0006)]

H-hey! Mabosstiff! Can...can you see? Are your\neyes open?![VAR 0114(0006)]
Yes! I did it![VAR 0114(0006)]
It...it’s been so long since he was able to open his\neyes! I was so worried...[VAR 0114(0006)]

I’m gonna bring Mabosstiff back to full health,\nI swear it![VAR 0114(0006)]
Oh...uh, yeah. So, that’s my story.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Three herbs to go. Let’s find ’em—together![VAR 0114(0006)]

I’m sure there’s some here, too...[VAR 0114(0006)]
Aha![VAR 0114(0006)]
I knew it! I spy Herba Mystica![VAR 0114(0006)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]You and Arven found the\n[VAR FF00(0008)][VAR 0109(0001)][VAR FF00(0000)]!
Another successful search! We’re on a roll![VAR 0114(0006)]
Now then, let’s see... What does the book have\nto say?[VAR 0114(0006)]
It says here that the [VAR FF00(0006)]Sweet Herba Mystica[VAR FF00(0000)] is good\nfor gut health and that it helps aid digestion.\c\nSays it’s great for stomachaches, too, or when\nyou want to stimulate the ol’ appetite![VAR 0114(0006)]
Well, apparently [VAR FF00(0006)]Salty Herba Mystica[VAR FF00(0000)] helps with\naching hands and feet. Good for neuropathy and\r\nnumbness.\c\nWhen you’ve got muscle weakness, it supposedly\nbuilds up strength again![VAR 0114(0006)]
[VAR FF00(0006)]Bitter Herba Mystica[VAR FF00(0000)]’s great for your circulation!\nIt really gets the blood flowing!\c\nAnd that warms you right up, nice and toasty,\neven boosting the immune system!\c\n...Or so it says.[VAR 0114(0006)]
OK, [VAR FF00(0006)]Sour Herba Mystica[VAR FF00(0000)] is chock-full of nutrients\nand is great for boosting your overall health!\c\nSays here it works wonders whether you’re tired\nphysically or mentally. Perks you right up![VAR 0114(0006)]
So it seems [VAR FF00(0006)]Spicy Herba Mystica[VAR FF00(0000)]’s supposed to\nboost your metabolism!\c\nIt gives your circulation a boost and helps flush\nout all those toxins...along with a ton of sweat![VAR 0114(0006)]
This’ll definitely help Mabosstiff feel even better![VAR 0114(0006)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Come on, [VAR 0100(0000)]... Let’s get\nsome\r\nfood\r\ngoing![VAR 0114(0006)]
Yeeeaaarrrt! Hiya! Huwatcha![VAR 0114(0006)]
Sorry to keep ya waiting!\c\nHere you go: another of your favorite ol’\nArven sandwiches![VAR 0114(0006)]
And it comes with a special Titan Badge!\c\nThe Pokémon League might not recognize it,\nbut I hope you appreciate it all the same![VAR 0114(0006)]
Gias?
Figured this might happen. Don’t worry—I made\nextra this time for that brute of yours.[VAR 0114(0006)]
*sniff sniff*
[VAR BD06(0000)]Do you want to give your sandwich\nto [VAR 0101(0001)]?
I’ll share!
This is mine...
Giaaawn...
[VAR BD06(0000)]Maybe you want to give your sandwich to\n[VAR 0101(0001)]\r\nafter all?
Gians!
Come on out, Mabosstiff. Got some for you,\ntoo, bud.[VAR 0114(0006)]
... ... ...
That’s it. Small bites, small bites...[VAR 0114(0006)]
*chomp chomp* *snarf* *chomp*
Agiaaas!
[VAR 0101(0001)] will be able to dash now!
[VAR BD06(0000)][VAR 0101(0001)] will be able to jump\nhigher now!
[VAR BD06(0000)][VAR 0101(0001)] will be able to glide now!
[VAR BD06(0000)][VAR 0101(0001)] will be able to move across the\nwater now!
[VAR BD06(0000)][VAR 0101(0001)] will be able to climb up\nvertical\r\nsurfaces\r\nnow!
C’mon... At least bother to taste it before you\nswallow it right down, would you?[VAR 0114(0006)]
Agia!
This brute seems to be benefiting from the herbs\ntoo, I guess—in its own sorta way.[VAR 0114(0006)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Oh yeah! ’Fore I forget,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]...\r\nTake\r\nanother\r\nlook\r\nat\r\nthis.[VAR 0114(0006)]
There’s always a Titan Pokémon near the Herba\nMystica when we find ’em, right?[VAR 0114(0006)]
Like the book says, it’s not like big ol’ Pokémon\njust happen to like these herbs.\c\nIt’s actually something in the herbs that’s making\nthe Titans so big and strong.[VAR 0114(0006)]
So does that mean a Titan’s “lair” isn’t really\nsome kind of treasure hoard or whatever?\r\nIt’s just a pantry where the Titan keeps its food?[VAR 0114(0006)]
... ... ...
Oh. You done with your sandwich, Mabosstiff?[VAR 0114(0006)]
Ruf...
“R-ruf”?![VAR 0114(0006)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]You...you heard that, right,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]?\r\nMabosstiff\r\njust\r\nwoofed!\r\nRight?![VAR 0114(0006)]
Right? I’m not imagining things![VAR 0114(0006)]
No! No, no, no, no, no! I’m sure I heard it!\nYou must’ve heard it too!\c\nSure you don’t need to get your ears checked?[VAR 0114(0006)]
...Ruff!
See! See that! I knew I wasn’t just hearing things![VAR 0114(0006)]
Oh, Mabosstiff! Who’s my best bud, huh?\nWho’s the best of boys? You are, yes, you are![VAR 0114(0006)]
*sniff*\nIt’s...it’s been so long since I heard that woof![VAR 0114(0006)]
Mabosstiff is definitely getting better![VAR 0114(0006)]
Ever since I teamed up with you, good things\nkeep happening![VAR 0114(0006)]
But we’ve still got two more herbs to go.\nHope you’ll stick it out until we’re done![VAR 0114(0006)]
Agia!

Bu-wuff! Wuff!
Yep, Mabosstiff says he’s ready![VAR 0114(0006)]
You’re battling with Mabosstiff?!
Wait, are you sure about this?!
OK, yeah, I can see why you’d be worried...[VAR 0114(0006)]
But my buddy here’s bursting with energy! You’d\nnever know he was so weak just a little while ago![VAR 0114(0006)]
Won’t leave me alone—always whining at me,\nwanting to battle you and your Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0006)]
It’s been so long I nearly forgot, but he always\ndid love to battle.\c\nEven if we always lost to that student council\ngirl—the battle fanatic one.[VAR 0114(0006)]

We’re a brand-new Arven and Mabosstiff! And\nwe’re feeling audacious—or maybe herbaceous?[VAR 0114(0006)]

Dang... This is the strength of someone who\ncould take down those Titan Pokémon, huh?[VAR 0114(0006)]
Yeah, much as I hate to admit it...I do think we’re\ngonna need some more support.[VAR 0114(0006)]
The Pokémon in Area Zero are super strong, and\nthere are all sorts of weird machines there, too.[VAR 0114(0006)]

Maybe...Penny?
The student council president?\c\nYou’re probably right. That girl can take on any\nPokémon that comes at her. She’s a beast![VAR 0114(0006)]
Penny? That crazy-smart hacker girl who was\nthe big boss behind Team Star?\c\nI mean, yeah, she’d be perfect for the job...\nBut when did you go making friends with some\r\nshady character like her?![VAR 0114(0006)]
The student council girl?\c\nYeah, she’d be perfect for the job, but I doubt\nshe’d give us the time of day unless one of us\r\nwas on her level. As in Champion Rank level.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Huh? Never knew we had someone all tech savvy\nlike that at school.\c\nBut I doubt someone with those skills would\nbother helping us out unless she owed us...\r\nor at least liked us.[VAR 0114(0006)]
But, well, we’ve gotta do what we’ve gotta do!\c\nWhoever you think could be a help, just try\ngetting in good with ’em![VAR 0114(0006)]
We’ll see if we can’t get a team together. Get in\ntouch if you make progress—I’ll do the same![VAR 0114(0006)]
Huh! Well, seems like you’ve been busy making\nsome pretty useful friends![VAR 0114(0006)]
I’ll reach out to them and organize things. You\njust make sure you’re there.\c\nThe meeting place will be the Zero Gate. It’s this\nfacility out on the edge of the Great Crater.\c\nI’ll send you the info on how to find it, so don’t\nkeep us waiting forever![VAR 0114(0006)]

Welcome to the Artazon Gym!
Let me register you as a challenger. Your name is\n[VAR 0100(0000)], yes?
Great! Now, in order to face Gym Leader\nBrassius, you’ll first need to pass the Gym Test.
Here at the Artazon Gym, that means completing\na game of [VAR FF00(0006)]Sunflora Hide-and-Seek[VAR FF00(0000)]!
As you may know, Artazon is a city of artists.\c\nThe artwork made by the people here is largely\ninspired by nature and the sun that nurtures it.\c\nSince Sunflora embody these concepts, we try to\ngather them and take good care of them!
Your job today is to find the Sunflora located\nthroughout Artazon. Remember—these Pokémon\r\nlook like sun-shaped flowers!
Gather up [VAR 0201(0001)] of them and bring them to the\nSunflora Lawn, and you pass the test.
I’ll register the Sunflora Lawn’s location in your\nmap app to get you started.\c\nWhen you leave the Gym, turn right and you’ll\nsee two large Sunflora statues—head for those!\c\nOnce you’re at the lawn’s entrance, the staffer\nthere will tell you more about the Gym Test.
Now get out there and have fun!

Sounds like the Sunflora are ready for you!
With that, your Gym Test has now begun!\c\nOnce you’ve found [VAR 0201(0001)] Sunflora, please bring\nthem back here to the Sunflora Lawn.
That’s all from me, now! Good luck out there!

Now, please head back to the lobby at the\nArtazon Gym to report your result.
Would you like to take on the Gym Test again\nand seek out some Sunflora?
Just like before, please find [VAR 0201(0001)] Sunflora and\nbring them back here to the Sunflora Lawn.
Good luck out there!
If you leave Artazon, you’ll have to start Sunflora\nHide-and-Seek all over again next time.\r\nDo you still want to leave the town?
You quit the Gym Test!\c\nIf you want to try again, go to the Sunflora Lawn.
Are you sure you want to give up and quit\nplaying Sunflora Hide-and-Seek?
No. of Sunflora found

[VAR BD06(0000)]Welcome to the Artazon Gym,\n[VAR 0100(0000)].
Are you ready to challenge Gym Leader Brassius,\nthe Verdant Virtuoso?
Very well. Allow me to show you to the\nbattle court.
Of course. Please feel free to come speak to me\nwhenever you’re ready.
Greetings, challenger![VAR 0114(002C)]
Hmph![VAR 0114(002C)]
You did well to come this far![VAR 0114(002C)]
I am Brassius—an artist specializing in Grass-type\nPokémon. I am also the Gym Leader here at the\r\nArtazon Gym.[VAR 0114(0017)]
I was observing your Gym Test from atop the\nwindmill, you know.[VAR 0114(0017)]
The perception you displayed in finding Sunflora\nwas truly... Oh, how shall I describe it?[VAR 0114(0017)]
Yes! It was truly avant-garde![VAR 0114(0017)]
I only pray that you might demonstrate that eye\nfor beauty in our battle as well.[VAR 0114(0017)]
Enough talk! We must begin creating our\ncollaborative work of art![VAR 0114(0017)]
I trust that you are ready? It is time for our\nmasterpiece to take shape![VAR 0114(0017)]
[~ 27]
Oh! What artistic tactics you employ![VAR 0114(0017)]
The patterns of your moves! The minute details\nof your Pokémon’s performance! Everything you\r\ndid was honed to perfection![VAR 0114(0017)]
Our battle was, in a word, art! Indeed, if we\ncould not call that a work of artistry, then nothing\r\nelse in this world could be labeled as such![VAR 0114(0017)]
If I were to judge your work, I would say it passes\nmy inspection. Yes—a pass without exception![VAR 0114(0017)]
As proof of your artistic prowess, you may have\nmy Gym Badge! Shall we take a photo as well?[VAR 0114(0017)]
If you possess [VAR 0200(0001)] Gym Badge[VAR 1101(0001,0100)]s, it will be easier\nto catch Pokémon of up to Lv. [VAR 0201(0002)], and those\r\nPokémon should follow your commands as well![VAR 0114(0017)]
If you possess 8 Gym Badges, you will be able\nto catch Pokémon of any level. And they will\r\nmost certainly obey your every command as well![VAR 0114(0017)]
To a fantastic Trainer such as yourself, I would\nalso like to offer this—a favorite of mine![VAR 0114(0017)]
Ah! My inspiration is overflowing, as if drawn\nfrom a bottomless well![VAR 0114(0017)]
I will begin on a new piece at once! You must\nexcuse me. Farewell![VAR 0114(0017)]
Congratulations! You’re now certified by the\nArtazon Gym!

Yep!
Uh...
I knew it! Of course you are!
You can’t fool me. You’re definitely a challenger!

He’ll be in big trouble without it...\c\nThat’s where you come in, kind Gym challenger!\nCould you please take Kofu’s wallet to him?
Ohhh! You are too kind! I’d give you a Gym\nBadge right now if I could!
I’m sorry, but it’s impossible to challenge our\nGym without Kofu here. I can’t exactly leave my\r\npost here at the lobby, either, so...

Kofu’s headed to [VAR FF00(0006)]Porto Marinada[VAR FF00(0000)]. It’s on the\nother side of the desert to the west.
Be careful, though. There are many dangerous\nPokémon in the desert!

I’m sure Kofu is real sad about forgetting his\nwallet here...
Please take it to him in [VAR FF00(0006)]Porto Marinada[VAR FF00(0000)], on the\nother side of the desert! I’m counting on you!
[~ 67]
What? YOU again?!
Vaultin’ Veluza! Where?! Where in the world...?[VAR 0114(0018)]
Where in the world is my wallet?![VAR 0114(0018)]
Without my wallet, I won’t be able to get today’s\nhot item! It’ll get bought up by someone else![VAR 0114(0018)]
*sniffle*[VAR 0114(0018)]
Don’t worry, ol’ man Kofu! I’ll run and look for it\nright now!
Whaddya want? Ol’ man Kofu’s in the middle of\nsome superduper important ingredient buyin’!
If yer thinkin’ about tryin’ to interrupt him, then\nI—his best apprentice—will have to stop you!
So do ya have somethin’ super important to\nsay to us busy folks, or what?
This is super important!
Uh, I guess it’s not that important...
Don’t bother us with somethin’ unimportant! Run\nback on home now, y’hear!
Super important, eh? We’ll see about that!\nMaybe a battle will shut yer mouth!
Dangit! That backfired... And now my wallet’s\nempty, too!
Heya, step right up...and tell me—what’s all the\nruckus about over here?[VAR 0114(0018)]
O-ol’ man Kofu! Seems this kid’s got somethin’\nto say to ya.
What’s that, now? A customer here for little ol’\nwalletless, moneyless me? What kin I do for ya?[VAR 0114(0018)]
I have your wallet!
You forgot this!
You returned Kofu’s wallet to him!
Vaultin’ Veluza! My wallet![VAR 0114(0018)]
Say what, now? My lobby staffer sent ya out here\nto bring it to me?[VAR 0114(0018)]
Gahaha! That’s a huge help! Thanks for comin’\nall this way![VAR 0114(0018)]
I guess I should apologize for my li’l apprentice,\ntoo. Hope he didn’t bother ya too much![VAR 0114(0018)]
There’s somethin’ here at the Porto Marinada\n[VAR FF00(0006)]auction[VAR FF00(0000)] that we really wanna get our hands on.[VAR 0114(0018)]
So, as you kin imagine, we were both a bit\nworked up to find I’d forgotten my wallet![VAR 0114(0018)]
Ladies and gents! You won’t wanna miss this!\nHere comes today’s last item!
Hmmm?[VAR 0114(0018)]
Feast yer eyes on the main event! I have ’ere the\nlegendary wakame seaweed of the Hoenn region!\r\nDo I have any takers?
Vaultin’ Veluza![VAR 0114(0018)]
I don’ even have to touch it—I can see it’s got the\nspringy texture of seaweed chock-full o’ nutrients![VAR 0114(0018)]
An’ just look at it! Look how it catches the light\nand shines so brilliantly![VAR 0114(0018)]
Ohhh, and that rich, fresh aroma of somethin’\nplucked straight outta the ocean![VAR 0114(0018)]
I need to get me some o’ that![VAR 0114(0018)]
Now listen, kid. If you wanna challenge me at the\nCascarrafa Gym, you’re gonna need some smarts.[VAR 0114(0018)]
And this is the perfect place to test ya! Get the\nwinnin’ bid on that seaweed for this ol’ man![VAR 0114(0018)]
What’s a “winning bid”?
OK! I’ll give it my best shot!
Well, ya see...here at the auction, you gotta\ncompete with other customers for goods!\c\nYou gotta be aware of how much money ya have,\no’ course, but the person who bids the highest\r\nprice gets to buy whatever’s on sale![VAR 0114(0018)]
Gahaha! You already know the ins an’ outs of\nauctions at such a young age?\c\nYou’re somethin’ else, kid![VAR 0114(0018)]
Here ya are. Fightin’ funds for the auction! Be\nsmart with it, an’ win this ol’ man that seaweed![VAR 0114(0018)]
All right, let’s get started!
Hoenn’s legendary wakame seaweed! We’ll start\nthe biddin’ at [VAR 0205(0001,002C)]!

That was amazin’! You put those grown-up\nbidders to shame with yer biddin’ skills![VAR 0114(0018)]
Thank ya for winnin’ that seaweed for this ol’\nman. I’ll be takin’ it now, if ya don’t mind.[VAR 0114(0018)]
You handed the legendary wakame seaweed\nto Kofu!
This seaweed’s a great catch! I’d be feelin’ low\nas the seabed if I’d failed to get my hands on it![VAR 0114(0018)]
If there’s any o’ that money I gave ya left, feel\nfree to keep it as a tip!\c\nYou kin even use it to try yer hand at the auction\nagain if ya like![VAR 0114(0018)]
All righty. I’mma head on back to the Cascarrafa\nGym now.[VAR 0114(0018)]

[VAR BD06(0000)]Welcome to the Cascarrafa Gym,\n[VAR 0100(0000)].
Are you ready to challenge Gym Leader Kofu,\nthe Surging Chef?
Very well. Allow me to show you to the\nbattle court.
Of course. Please feel free to come speak to me\nwhenever you’re ready.
Old man Kofu! Play with us! C’mon!
I would be honored if you would try a new item\nfrom my restaurant’s menu as well.
Sorry, everybody! I’ve got some business to take\ncare of as Gym Leader real quick-like![VAR 0114(0018)]
I’m keepin’ someone waitin’, ya see. Please\nforgive me. I need to do this first![VAR 0114(0018)]
OK!
Heya, step right up! I’ve been waitin’ for ya.[VAR 0114(0018)]
Thanks for the help over in Porto Marinada!\nYou did a mighty fine job![VAR 0114(0018)]
And now that I’ve got that legendary seaweed,\nI kin make some real quality dishes with it![VAR 0114(0018)]
But don’ expect me to go easy on ya in our\nbattle here![VAR 0114(0018)]
[~ 28]
At the auction, we battle with buyin’ and sellin’.\nAt my Gym, we battle in a more traditional sense![VAR 0114(0018)]
Moves and tactics—ever-changin’ as the\nraging sea![VAR 0114(0018)]
I’mma serve you a full course o’ Water-type\nPokémon! Don’t try to eat ’em, though![VAR 0114(0018)]
Gahaha! A loss as refreshing as the air at the\nmorning market![VAR 0114(0018)]
I’m just like a helpless little Magikarp to you, eh?\nFloppin’ around all willy-nilly![VAR 0114(0018)]
You got me good, I tell ya! What a great catch\nyou are![VAR 0114(0018)]
Just like a master fisher, ya held on tight till the\nlast second and reeled in victory![VAR 0114(0018)]
Now it’s time to hand over a Gym Badge to ya!\c\nAnd let’s get a REEL good photo together usin’ a\npose I’ve been wantin’ to try out for a while now![VAR 0114(0018)]
With [VAR 0200(0001)] Gym Badge[VAR 1101(0001,0100)]s in yer possession, Pokémon\nof up to Lv. [VAR 0201(0002)] will be easier to catch and’ll listen\r\nto ya when you ask ’em to do things![VAR 0114(0018)]
With 8 Gym Badges in yer possession, you kin\ncatch Pokémon of any level, and they’ll all listen\r\nto ya when you ask ’em to do things, too![VAR 0114(0018)]
Lemme throw this in too as an extra-special\nbonus! I’m sure you kin make good use of it![VAR 0114(0018)]
All righty. It’s about time I headed on back to my\nrestaurant and got to preppin’ for the next wave![VAR 0114(0018)]
You come back to see me again now, ya hear?[VAR 0114(0018)]

Whoa, whoa! Hold it, you![VAR 0114(002D)]
Up ahead’s the base of operations for Team\nStar’s Dark crew.\c\nYou may know us as the Segin Squad![VAR 0114(002E)]
Yup! And we don’t take too kindly to random\nkids sniffing around our turf.[VAR 0114(002D)]
Sorry, but if you don’t turn yourself around here,\namig[VAR 1100(00FF,0101)]oa, we’ll have to send you packing![VAR 0114(002E)]
Wait, hold up...\c\nJust going on a hunch here, but...are you that\n[VAR 0100(0000)] kid?[VAR 0114(002D)]
Y’know, that piece of work we’re out to get for\ndeclaring war on Team Star?[VAR 0114(002D)]
Maybe I am
You’ve got it all wrong!
“Maybe I am,” [VAR 1100(00FF,0100)]she says. Cool as a cucumber!\nHonesty’s not always the best policy, you know...[VAR 0114(002E)]
Talk about suspicious! That’s exactly what\nsomeone trying to slip under the radar would say![VAR 0114(002E)]
Ugh, you know what? Doesn’t matter who you\nare. You’re not gettin’ through.\c\nBuzz off or get thrashed by me in battle, kid.\nWhat’ll it be?[VAR 0114(002D)]
I’ll take you on!
I’ll get out of your hair...
Have a nice walk back, then! Hasta la vistar! ☆[VAR 0114(002E)]
Graaah! Sassy kids like you are the worst!\nThat’s it—prepare to get stomped into the dirt![VAR 0114(002D)]

Well, I’m gonna go into the base now and\ngive the rest of the squad the heads-up.[VAR 0114(002E)]

I see you took care of the guards. Nice work.[VAR 0114(0009)]
Now, holed up in that base is Team Star’s Dark\ncrew—the Segin Squad.[VAR 0114(0009)]
Their boss, Giacomo, pretty much runs the whole\nof Team Star, and he also produced that wild\r\nsoundtrack of theirs himself.[VAR 0114(0009)]
He’s a sharp guy. Even our declaration of war\nwon’t have ruffled him in the slightest.[VAR 0114(0009)]
His plan is probably to wear you down with a\nwave of grunts, then finish you off himself.[VAR 0114(0009)]
No use trying to outthink strategic types like him.\nBring him down with a head-on attack![VAR 0114(0009)]

Nice to meet you and all...but how ’bout we skip\nstraight to your outro?\c\nDon’t worry—I’ll play you a sick requiem as you\ncrash and burn.[VAR 0114(0021)]

Guess that’s that...[VAR 0114(0021)]
About a year and a half ago...
What’s up, Giacomo? Did something happen?[VAR 0114(0020)]
The big boss just wanted my take on some stuff...\nSo we had a chat and settled on a few plans.[VAR 0114(0021)]
“A few plans”...? Like, for what?[VAR 0114(001F)]
Operation Star, first of all. And also...a new code\nof conduct for the team.[VAR 0114(0021)]
You know how tons of new members have joined\nup recently?\c\nWell, we figure we gotta make some team rules—\nlike a code—so we’ll all be on the same page.[VAR 0114(0021)]
Nice! You’ll come up with a great code for us,\nwon’t you, Giacomo?[VAR 0114(0022)]
Hah, no thanks. Waaay too much pressure.[VAR 0114(0021)]
I mean, yeah, I used to be president of the\nstudent council. But you know everyone ended\r\nup hating me after that, right?[VAR 0114(0021)]
’Course we know. You forced a ton of stuffy\nrules on everyone, and they wouldn’t take it.\c\nWe got some other nerd to replace you after,\nlike, five minutes.[VAR 0114(001F)]
I cannot help but concur...\c\n“Male students’ hair must stray no further than\n1.8 inches below the nape” and so forth...\c\nYour rules were vexation made manifest![VAR 0114(0023)]
My point exactly! So you’ll all agree that I\nshouldn’t be let anywhere near this new code.[VAR 0114(0021)]
But you always know what’s best for the team,\nGiacomo! You look out for us![VAR 0114(0020)]
You’ve earned our trust many times over. Without\nyou, Team Star just wouldn’t work.[VAR 0114(0022)]
That stuck-up student council prez isn’t who you\nare anymore, man.\c\nA code written by the Giacomo I’m lookin’ at\nnow... I’d follow that any day.[VAR 0114(001F)]
As would I![VAR 0114(0023)]
OK, OK, thanks for the ego boost, everyone.\nI’ll do it... I’ll write up the darn code.[VAR 0114(0021)]
I did the best I could...[VAR 0114(0021)]
I wrote that code myself, and there’s no goin’\nback on it now. My days as a boss are over.\r\nSo here—take my Star Badge, would ya?[VAR 0114(0021)]
I’ll give you this choice TM, too. You earned it\nfair ’n’ square.[VAR 0114(0021)]
Haaah. So this is how the party ends...[VAR 0114(0021)]
But let’s talk about th[VAR 1101(00FD,0302)]atose Pokémon of yours.\n[VAR 1101(00FD,0704)]It’sThey’re crazy strong, huh.[VAR 0114(0021)]
You learn those Trainer chops at the academy?\nLike, what moves you should use ’n’ stuff?[VAR 0114(0021)]
Sure did!
Nope
Huh. OK... You like it at the academy?\nHavin’ fun?[VAR 0114(0021)]
Yeah, I’m enjoying it!
It’s not the best...
No kiddin’...[VAR 0114(0021)]
Sorry to interrupt, but are you Giacomo?[VAR 0114(001E)]
Whoa-ho! Wasn’t expecting a giant pompadour\nto make a guest appearance today.\c\nYou get a Quaxwell to style that up for ya?[VAR 0114(0021)]
I’m just after a quick word. Would you mind?[VAR 0114(001E)]
Sure. I can tell it’s gonna be somethin’ annoying,\nbut I guess I’m newly freed up for time.[VAR 0114(0021)]

It seems all of you in Team Star are headed for\nexpulsion if you keep up your current activities.[VAR 0114(001E)]
So why won’t you break up the team and start\nattending class at the academy again?[VAR 0114(001E)]
That’s what you wanna know?\c\nAs it happens, we’re actually waitin’ on a pal...\nthough we don’t know if they’ll be comin’ back.[VAR 0114(0021)]
A pal...? A close friend of yours, are they?[VAR 0114(001E)]
[~ 62]
[~ 62]
They’re only the strongest boss in all of\nTeam Star!\c\nLike how there’s a Top Champion who’s the\nabsolute number-one Trainer, y’know?[VAR 0114(0021)]
They’re the one who invited us other bosses to\nform the team. We call ’em the “big boss.”[VAR 0114(0021)]
And where is this big boss of yours now?[VAR 0114(001E)]
Wouldn’t we like to know. We haven’t heard from\n’em in, I dunno...must be a year and a half now.[VAR 0114(0021)]
[~ 62]
We thought that if we kept Team Star going, then\nthey’d get back in touch one day.[VAR 0114(0021)]
But the teachers keep pressin’ us to call it quits,\nand then we get party crashers like you two...[VAR 0114(0021)]
... ... ...[VAR 0114(001E)]
Maybe the big boss did ditch us... They were\ntalkin’ about breakin’ up the team before and all.[VAR 0114(0021)]
So, Team Star and this big boss of yours...\nThey’re really that important to you?[VAR 0114(001E)]
Heh. Is the sky blue?\c\nLet me put it in words you eggheads at the\nacademy might understand...\c\nThey’re my greatest treasure.[VAR 0114(0021)]

Great! Now, in order to face Gym Leader Tulip,\nyou’ll first need to pass the Gym Test.
Here at the Alfornada Gym, that means working\nup a sweat with a special kind of [VAR FF00(0006)]exercise[VAR FF00(0000)]!
I’m talking about the [VAR FF00(0006)]Emotional Spectrum[VAR FF00(0000)]\n[VAR FF00(0006)]Practice[VAR FF00(0000)] created by Tulip herself, of course.\r\nComplete it, and you pass the test!

Welcome to the Alfornada Gym! Would you like\nme to explain the rules of the Gym Test again?
The Gym Test here is a special kind of [VAR FF00(0006)]exercise[VAR FF00(0000)]!
I’m talking about the [VAR FF00(0006)]Emotional Spectrum[VAR FF00(0000)]\n[VAR FF00(0006)]Practice[VAR FF00(0000)] created by Tulip herself, of course.\r\nComplete it, and you pass the test!
Head out of the Gym and turn left to find the\npractice area.\c\nThe woman wearing a black tracksuit will explain\nthe rules to you there.
Osu! Welcome, new kid! This is where we do\nEmotional Spectrum Practice.[VAR 0114(0024)]
Why is your battle studies teacher here at a\nPokémon Gym working as an instructor, you ask?[VAR 0114(0024)]
Well, I’ve been friends with the Gym Leader\nhere, Tulip, since we were kids.[VAR 0114(0024)]
We decided to have a Pokémon battle with a\nspecial rule—the loser has to do what the winner\r\nsays. So we battled, and, well...[VAR 0114(0024)]
Look, never mind what happened! Point is, this is\na chance to both get a workout in and help my\r\nfriend when I don’t have classes![VAR 0114(0024)]
The rules of Emotional Spectrum Practice—or ESP\nfor short—are simple!\c\nI’ll show you a certain movement, and all you\nhave to do is copy it![VAR 0114(0024)]
Ready to get this Gym Test started? I hope your\nbody and mind are ready for the challenge![VAR 0114(0024)]
Great! Let’s get to exercising! Show me an\neruption of emotions![VAR 0114(0024)]
OK! Preparation is important, after all. Come\ntalk to me again when you’re good and ready![VAR 0114(0024)]
Nice! You’re moving really well! Both you and\nyour Pokémon are looking great, new kid![VAR 0114(0024)]
That was awesome! I can’t stop grinning after\nwitnessing such perfect power of expression![VAR 0114(0024)]
That’s enough of a warm-up! Now let’s really put\nthose muscles to work with a Pokémon battle![VAR 0114(0024)]
You gotta keep moving! This is no ordinary\nbattle—this is a workout!
Great! I can hear your Pokémon AND your\nmuscles screaming with delight![VAR 0114(0024)]
I see you’re getting tired, but you’ve gotta hang\nin there! Time to start the second half![VAR 0114(0024)]
Covered in sweat and overflowing with emotion!\nThat was an impressive round![VAR 0114(0024)]
That was perfect! I almost lost track of who was\nteaching who![VAR 0114(0024)]
Don’t give up yet! It’s time for another battle!\nHold out against all that lactic acid![VAR 0114(0024)]
My goal is to grow strong and build muscle.\nAny tips?
Good job! You made it all the way through the\nESP exercise![VAR 0114(0024)]
You passed this test—no doubt about it!\nCongratulations![VAR 0114(0024)]
But you’re not done yet! Sprint over to the lobby\nstaffer on the double!\c\nYou have to report your passing grade to\nformally finish the Gym Test![VAR 0114(0024)]
Awww, that was close! But it looks like you may\nneed to train a bit harder before you can take\r\non the Psychic-type Gym for real![VAR 0114(0024)]
If you don’t plan on giving up, come back again\nsometime and show me what you’re made of![VAR 0114(0024)]

I suppose you’re right. OK, I’ll get things moving\nhere on my end.[VAR 0114(002C)]
Let’s keep the tag line simple—\n“Naturally Beautiful.”[VAR 0114(002C)]
And order the new eye-shadow color too,\nwould you?[VAR 0114(002C)]
Thanks, you’re a doll. Gotta run now. Chat with\nyou later.[VAR 0114(002C)]
Hello there.[VAR 0114(002C)]
I’m Tulip, the Gym Leader here.\c\nThough I must tell you that being a makeup artist\nis my main line of work.[VAR 0114(001C)]
Dendra had nothing but praise for you. She said\nyou totally slayed out there.[VAR 0114(001C)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Hehe. I must say, you are a cute challenger,\n[VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(001C)]
I’m sure my ESP exercise made you all the more\nbeautiful. Doesn’t that make you happy?[VAR 0114(001C)]
You keep your Pokémon beautiful and clean as\nwell. I see you have quite the aesthetic sense.[VAR 0114(001C)]
[~ 30]
Appearance is equally important for both people\nand Pokémon.[VAR 0114(001C)]
Makeup is like magic. Anyone can use it to\nchange their appearance.[VAR 0114(001C)]
Allow me to put my skills to use to make your\ncute little Pokémon even more beautiful![VAR 0114(001C)]
I lost the battle? And your beauty rivals even my\nown? I can’t believe it.[VAR 0114(001C)]
You are quite splendid. Yes, truly amazing![VAR 0114(001C)]
Perhaps I should take you under my wing before\nyou make your big break elsewhere...[VAR 0114(001C)]
But I suppose I need to work on myself a little\nmore first before I run off and do such a thing.[VAR 0114(001C)]
You have earned my Gym Badge. Allow me to\nstrike one of my best poses to give it to you.\r\nCongratulations, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(001C)]
With [VAR 0200(0001)] Gym Badge[VAR 1101(0001,0100)]s, Pokémon of up to Lv. [VAR 0201(0002)]\nwill be easier to catch and will listen to the\r\ncommands you give them.[VAR 0114(001C)]
With all 8 Gym Badges, you’ll be able to catch\nPokémon of any level. They’ll be good Pokémon\r\nand listen to your commands, too.[VAR 0114(001C)]
If you train hard, you’ll be able to use this move\nin a totally perfect way.[VAR 0114(001C)]
Don’t go uploading that selfie we just took to\nsocial media, OK?[VAR 0114(001C)]
I think my makeup has run a little with all the\nmoving and sweating I did during our battle.[VAR 0114(001C)]
I need to fix it fast before my next appointment.\nMy schedule is absolutely packed, you know.\c\nFarewell, then. You did splendidly today.[VAR 0114(001C)]
Congratulations! You’re now certified by the\nAlfornada Gym!

Welcome to the Montenevera Gym! Would you\nlike me to explain the Gym Test rules again?
Your test here at the Montenevera Gym is to\nwarm up the audience for the main event!\r\nThat’s right—you’re the [VAR FF00(0006)]opening act[VAR FF00(0000)]!
You’ll need to get up on stage, show us some\ndead fierce Pokémon battles, and get the crowd\r\nexcited before the Gym Leader’s concert begins!
You can start the Gym Test by speaking with\nMC Sledge in front of the stage outside.
Yo, Trainer! You the one performin’ the opening\nact today? My name’s MC Sledge! This is the\r\nstage right here![VAR 0114(003B)]
So here’s the deal. We’re gonna have you do\nsome Double Battles! That’s where you have two\r\nPokémon fight on each side.[VAR 0114(003B)]
[~ 55]
That’ll let you sledge up double the opponents\nand get the audience twice as excited! The venue\r\nwill be so hot, it’ll melt the Montenevera snow![VAR 0114(003B)]
Once you get the audience worked up and ready\nto go, that’ll be the cue for our leader to take the\r\nstage! That’s how you pass our Gym Test, yo![VAR 0114(003B)]
Your opening act begins as soon as you get up on\nstage! There’ll be no backing down until you win\r\nthree times in a row, so make sure you’re ready![VAR 0114(003B)]
You good on the deets for the opening act and\nour Gym Test? Ready to sledge ’em up?![VAR 0114(003B)]
Yep! I’m ready!
Not yet
Could you explain again?
Hey now! You’re gonna need two Pokémon for\nthis Gym Test, yo![VAR 0114(003B)]
I feel ya. Openin’ for Ryme is no easy task! Make\nsure you’re ready to go before we start![VAR 0114(003B)]
Sweet! Just play it by ear—you’ll do great! Head\non up to the stage![VAR 0114(003B)]
What’s up, Monteneveraaa! Today’s opening act\nwill be three back-to-back Double Battles by our\r\nchallenger here, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(003B)]
And the first of their three opponents will be a\nyoung performer who makes it look like a breeze![VAR 0114(003B)]
The one, the only...Tas![VAR 0114(003B)]
Double Battles—that means one plus one, right?\nCan you do that math?

Keep on sledgin’! You got this![VAR 0114(003B)]
Aaand our challenger’s next opponent will be a\nmusician with a bit of a unique style...[VAR 0114(003B)]
Iiit’s Lani![VAR 0114(003B)]
Strong complements weak! The harmony of two\nPokémon battling in unison!
The audience is really getting excited!
Your opening act’s turned the cheering AND the\nstage lighting up to 11![VAR 0114(003B)]
What a surprise from our new challenger! Who’d\nhave thought they’d sledge it up this much?![VAR 0114(003B)]
Next is your last opponent. And it’s none other\nthan...[VAR 0114(003B)]
ME! MC Sledge![VAR 0114(003B)]
Bein’ an MC isn’t my only forte—I can battle too!\nI’ll sledge ya up real good in a Double Battle![VAR 0114(003B)]

C’mon, everybody—say it with me! This is what\nyou’ve all been waitin’ for...[VAR 0114(003B)]

Are you ready to challenge Gym Leader Ryme,\nthe MC of RIP?
Very well. Allow me to show you to the\nbattle court.
Of course. Please feel free to come speak to me\nwhenever you’re ready.
Oh! You will need at least two Pokémon fit for\nbattle in order to challenge Ryme!
Yo, yo!
It sounds like there might be a rap battle going\non over at the stage.
This is MY time, and this is MY day!\nYou’re not gonna stand in my way!
Listen up, Ryme—your reign ends here!\nYou’re gonna get rung up by this pro cashier!
*BOOM chhh BOOM* *BOOM chhh BOOM*

*BOOM chhh BOOM* *BOOM chhh BOOM*
I’m done—you won! My rhymes totally whiffed!\nBut I’ll be back—maybe after my next shift!
Hold up! Where you goin’? That’s all you got?!\c\n“After my next shift”? Seriously? Bars over jokes,\ncome on![VAR 0114(001B)]
That was over way too fast. It gets boring wearin’\nthe crown if no one makes me fight to keep it.[VAR 0114(001B)]
Hm?[VAR 0114(001B)]
Hey, my opener’s back! You here for a rap battle\nor a Gym battle?[VAR 0114(001B)]

As if I even needed to ask![VAR 0114(001B)]
Hah! You got jokes! We both know why you’re\nREALLY here.[VAR 0114(001B)]
You were captivated by that show I put on, huh?[VAR 0114(001B)]
I rap what’s in my soul, baby. Weavin’ words into\na symphony of poetry.[VAR 0114(001B)]
Don’t try it with me—you won’t last one round.\nI’m like Sableye: my Mean Look’ll lock you down!\c\nLike that! You feel me?[VAR 0114(001B)]
Heh. Well, let’s get to it—you’re a Pokémon\nTrainer. So battle me, and show me who you are![VAR 0114(001B)]
My music’s not all that tops the charts—my skills\nwith Ghost types are the best around![VAR 0114(001B)]
Lest you forget it, the name is Ryme, and I’m\nknown as the MC of RIP![VAR 0114(001B)]
Dead or alive, let’s make this a vibe![VAR 0114(001B)]
Hah! Great battle—chilling AND thrilling![VAR 0114(001B)]
You’ve got spirit, kid. You earned my Gym\nBadge, all right![VAR 0114(001B)]
And how about a VIP pass for my next show, too?[VAR 0114(001B)]
With [VAR 0200(0001)] Gym Badge[VAR 1101(0001,0100)]s, it’ll be easier to catch\nPokémon of up to Lv. [VAR 0201(0002)], and they’ll listen to\r\nwhat you have to say, too![VAR 0114(001B)]
With 8 Gym Badges, you’ll be able to catch\nPokémon of any level, and they’ll be sure to\r\nlisten to what you have to say, too![VAR 0114(001B)]
I’m feelin’ so good that I think I’m also gonna let\nyou have this![VAR 0114(001B)]
Too bad it’s over! Make your way back to my\nstage sometime. Maybe next time, we rap battle\r\ninstead. Who knows?[VAR 0114(001B)]
I’m sure you’ve got some scary-good adventures\nahead. I’ll be cheerin’ for ya! Later![VAR 0114(001B)]

[VAR BD06(0000)]Hello, [VAR 0100(0000)].\nWelcome\r\nto\r\nthe\r\nGlaseado Gym.
Do you want to face the Sub-zero Shredder\nhimself, Gym Leader Grusha?
Very well. Allow me to show you to the\nbattle court.
Of course. Please feel free to come speak to me\nwhenever you’re ready.

My name’s Grusha. I’m a snowboarder. Used to\nbe pro, actually.\c\nNow I’m a Gym Leader.[VAR 0114(001A)]
I saw you on the slopes. Your skills... Yeah, they\nwere pretty cool.[VAR 0114(001A)]
But don’t let that go to your head.[VAR 0114(001A)]
Winter mountains are dangerous. They can throw\nyour life right off course, easy as that.[VAR 0114(001A)]
Same thing with Pokémon battles, really...\nIt’s always the most dangerous when you’re\r\njust starting to get the hang of things.[VAR 0114(001A)]
Today’s not a great day to face me, you know...\nYou’re better off giving up.[VAR 0114(001A)]
You sure you want to battle me?[VAR 0114(001A)]
You bet!
Uh, I’m not sure now...
Still tryin’ to act cool, huh? That’s too bad.[VAR 0114(001A)]
Nice. Backing off takes its own kind of courage.\nBut I know your type. You always choose to push\r\nforward in the end.[VAR 0114(001A)]
Well, this is my job now...so don’t take what\nI’m about to do personally.[VAR 0114(001A)]
Get ready to feel the icy bite of reality.[VAR 0114(001A)]
That burning passion you have... You strive for\nthe future, no matter what challenges you face.[VAR 0114(001A)]
Just like how I used to be...[VAR 0114(001A)]
Oh, never mind. I should give you your\nGym Badge.[VAR 0114(001A)]
Huh? You want a photo together to\ncommemorate your win...?[VAR 0114(001A)]
C-come on, that’s...that’s so uncool.\nI don’t usually do that sort of thing, but...\r\nOK, fine. Special occasion.[VAR 0114(001A)]
With [VAR 0200(0001)] Gym Badge[VAR 1101(0001,0100)]s, you should be able to catch\nPokémon of up to Lv. [VAR 0201(0002)] more easily.\c\nThey’ll actually listen to you too, which is nice.[VAR 0114(001A)]
With 8 Gym Badges, you should be able to catch\nPokémon of any level. They’ll also listen to every\r\nword you say, whether it’s cool or not.[VAR 0114(001A)]
Oh, and before I forget—you should take\nthis, too.[VAR 0114(001A)]
Should be a lot more useful than some silly\nphoto of you and me...[VAR 0114(001A)]
Feel free to stop by again... If you don’t mind the\ncold, that is.[VAR 0114(001A)]

Welcome to the Cortondo Gym! Would you like\nme to explain the rules of the Gym Test again?
The Gym Test here is the [VAR FF00(0006)]Olive Roll[VAR FF00(0000)]!
To pass the test, you’ll need to roll an olive-\nshaped ball all the way to the goal.\c\nYour efforts should help ensure we get a great\nolive harvest next year, too!
When you’re ready to start, head to the olive-\nrolling field just to the [VAR FF00(0006)]north of town[VAR FF00(0000)].\c\nThe staffer over there will explain the rules to\nyou in further detail.
Welcome to the olive-rolling field!
This Gym Test is all about stamina—you’ll need\nto push with all you’ve got to get a large olive\r\nball rolling and make it all the way to the end.
Get the ball over various obstacles, then push it\ninto the goal to clear the course.
Now that you’re all filled in, are you ready to\nstart the Gym Test?
Great! Put in a wish for a good olive harvest,\nand roll, roll, roll away!
No problem. Just come let me know when you’re\nall set to go.
Welcome back! Are you ready for some\nolive rolling?
Here, I’ll open up a shortcut for you...if you\nmanage to defeat me!
Let’s see if you can get past my wall of Smoliv!
OK, Team Smoliv! Time to clear the way!
You should ride a Pokémon and get it to push the\nolive for you. It’ll be much easier to roll that way!
With that performance, I’m sure we can look\nforward to a great olive harvest next year!
I’m happy to declare your Gym Test officially\ncleared. Congratulations!
Please report your result to the lobby staffer at\nthe Gym. Good luck in your battle against Katy!
Do you want to give up on the Olive Roll\nfor now?
Are you sure you want to quit?
[~ 33]
[~ 33]
[~ 33]
I’ll keep going
I’d like to quit
If you’re looking for a shortcut, you gotta earn it!\nYou’re not getting past me easily!
Even the Smoliv can tell how strong you are!\nThey’ll step aside for you now.
I got in the way of your olive rolling because I\nwanted you to see how tough it is to grow olives!
Give Up

Once you’ve found a TM during your travels,\nyou can then use a TM Machine to make copies\r\nof that TM. You did know that, right?[VAR 0114(0016)]
I wish you luck in your future adventures. May\nthey be as sweet and lovely as a good dessert.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Off you go, then. Until we meet again![VAR 0114(0016)]

[VAR BD06(0000)]Oh? Why hello,\nM[VAR 1100(00FF,0305)]asteriss [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(000A)]
How is your Treasure Hunt coming along?\nHaving all sorts of fun adventures, I hope?[VAR 0114(000A)]
Yeah, it’s been great!
It’s not going so well...
Wonderful. I’m glad to hear it.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Oh my. Is that so...[VAR 0114(000A)]
Do keep in mind that the Treasure Hunt has no\nset course or criteria you must follow.\c\nSimply go where your heart takes you, and you\nshall do splendidly.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Speaking of such pursuits, there has been\nsomething on my mind of late.[VAR 0114(000A)]
If I could ask for your expertise on the matter,\nI would be most grateful.[VAR 0114(000A)]
You see, I recently heard a word whose meaning\nescapes me. I believe it to be some sort of slang.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Tell me, what does “cheugy” mean?[VAR 0114(000A)]
Something super cool
Being outdated and uncool
It’s a really chewy gumball
I see! So one might say, “Today’s lesson was the\ncheugiest!” Is that right?[VAR 0114(000A)]
Ah... I think I understand. For both speaker and\nrecipient, it is not a pleasant word, I take it...[VAR 0114(000A)]
A...very chewy gumball? So it is some sort of\nconfection that children are partial to recently?\c\nI shall have to try one of these “cheugies” for\nmyself sometime.[VAR 0114(000A)]
The words used by young people these days are\nquite often beyond my comprehension.\c\nBut when I learn the meanings behind the words,\nI find that I feel that much closer to my students.[VAR 0114(000A)]
I am most grateful to you for your help on\nthat front.[VAR 0114(000A)]
You became slightly closer with Director Clavell!

I must say, I am pleased to see you on school\ngrounds again.\c\nTravel and adventure certainly have their place,\nbut it does one good to attend class as well, no?[VAR 0114(000A)]
Speaking of which, there is something I would\nvery much like to ask you...[VAR 0114(000A)]
I understand you have joined a variety of classes\nduring your time here at the academy.\c\nBut, if I may ask, which of our faculty members\nhas made the most favorable impression on you?[VAR 0114(000A)]
Mr. Jacq
Ms. Tyme
Ms. Raifort
Mr. Salvatore
Ms. Dendra
Mr. Hassel

Oho. Ms. Tyme from math class, you say?\c\nYes, she is a fine teacher. A most warm and\npeaceable woman.[VAR 0114(000A)]

Oho. Mr. Saguaro from home economics class,\nyou say?\c\nYes, he is a fine teacher. A most calm and\ncollected fellow.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Oho. Nurse Miriam, you say?\c\nYes, she is a fine practitioner of medicine. A most\nkind and gentle soul.[VAR 0114(000A)]
M-me?! Are you quite sure?\c\nI suspect some element of diplomacy may be at\nwork here, but if that is indeed how you feel...\r\nthen I am most happy to hear it.[VAR 0114(000A)]
We are truly blessed to have so many wonderful\nteachers and staff members at Naranja Academy.[VAR 0114(000A)]
We are truly blessed to have so many wonderful\nteachers and staff members at Uva Academy.[VAR 0114(000A)]
I firmly believe that our faculty is second to none\nin their commitment to our students’ ongoing\r\neducation and well-being.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Thank you very much for sharing your thoughts,\nM[VAR 1100(00FF,0305)]asteriss [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(000A)]

A good friend of mine has been telling me of\nyour recent exploits.[VAR 0114(000A)]
A good friend?
You mean Clive?
Ha ha... I’ll leave their identity to your\nimagination.[VAR 0114(000A)]
But now, lest I forget, there is another matter\nI would very much like your opinion on.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Do you know what manner of gentleman’s\nhairstyle is considered cool, as it were, among\r\nthe youth these days?[VAR 0114(000A)]
Short styles
Two-block cuts
Bowl cuts
Long locks
Giant pompadours
Oh? Is that so?\c\nI suppose I have indeed seen some of the\nacademy’s male students sporting such a style.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Oho! Pompadours, you say? I suspected as much!\c\nThough I don’t seem to recall many of the\nacademy’s male students sporting such a style...[VAR 0114(000A)]
Could it be, then, that the pompadour has\nalready had its day in the sun...?\c\nPerhaps I ought to consider a change of wig...[VAR 0114(000A)]
Ah. That is to say... Never mind.[VAR 0114(000A)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Thank you for your insight, M[VAR 1100(00FF,0305)]asteriss\n[VAR 0100(0000)].\r\nIt was\r\nmost\r\nenlightening.[VAR 0114(000A)]

So, I have one more thing to ask of you—though\nthe request is admittedly of a delicate nature.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Do you think you could continue being good\nfriends with Miss Penny as you have thus far?[VAR 0114(000A)]
You bet!
Sure—we’re best buds!
I must say...I truly am glad to have you as one\nof my students at the academy.[VAR 0114(000A)]

Welcome to the home economics classroom.\nI consider this to be my very own castle of sorts.[VAR 0114(0029)]

Rumors of your activities always seem to be\nbombarding me from all sides.[VAR 0114(0029)]
My activities?
From all sides?
Indeed. People from all over have been talking\nabout how strong of a battler you are and the\r\namazing Pokémon you take along with you.[VAR 0114(0029)]
You are quite the object of everyone’s interest—\nthough I imagine that may be a bother for you.[VAR 0114(0029)]
The home economics classroom is something of a\nplace of rest for the academy’s students, you see.[VAR 0114(0029)]
Here, they delight in sharing the latest gossip and\nthe like while enjoying a light snack.[VAR 0114(0029)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]You come up quite often in those talks recently,\nM[VAR 1100(00FF,0305)]asteriss [VAR 0100(0000)]. So much so\r\nthat\r\nI\r\nfind\r\nmyself\r\nintrigued.[VAR 0114(0029)]

Are you here to eat as well?[VAR 0114(0029)]
Yep! I’m starving
I just kind of wandered in
Ha! Excellent. You shouldn’t battle on an empty\nstomach.[VAR 0114(0029)]
Drawn in by the irresistible aromas, I imagine.[VAR 0114(0029)]
I myself am here to...survey the student cafeteria,\nlet’s say.[VAR 0114(0029)]
I am observing the nutritional content of the food\nthat our students partake of on a regular basis.[VAR 0114(0029)]
One item on the menu here that I am particularly\ninterested in is the Peanut Butter Sandwich.\r\nIt is sweet and quite delicious.[VAR 0114(0029)]
Yes...perhaps I will order one right now.[VAR 0114(0029)]
Oh look! It’s Mr. Saguaro! He’s so fashionable\nand cool.
I guess the teachers come to the cafeteria too,\nhuh? D’you think he’ll have an Egg Sandwich?
No way! If he gets anything here, it’ll definitely\nbe something spicy, like the Five-Alarm Sandwich!
Ahhh! He’s so cool! He’ll definitely get that wild\nand spicy Five-Alarm Sandwich!
... ... ...[VAR 0114(0029)]
Could I have a...Five-Alarm Sandwich? I do enjoy\nthe thrill of spicy food.[VAR 0114(0029)]
But, Mr. Saguaro! What about...?
No! Have a Peanut Butter Sandwich!
[VAR BD06(0000)]A-ah, yes. You suggested I have a Peanut Butter\nSandwich,\r\nM[VAR 1100(00FF,0305)]asteriss\r\n[VAR 0100(0000)]?\r\nI\r\nsuppose\r\nI\r\nshall\r\nhave\r\nto\r\ntry\r\none.\r\nIf\r\nyou insist.[VAR 0114(0029)]

[VAR BD06(0000)]I thank you for restraining me,\nM[VAR 1100(00FF,0305)]asteriss [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0029)]
It seems that the students tend to view me as\nfashionable and cool...or even—dare I say it?—\r\nexuding a sort of brooding strength.[VAR 0114(0029)]
I have a habit of acting in such a way so as not to\ndestroy their image of me.[VAR 0114(0029)]

There is something that I would...very much like\nto ask for your help with.[VAR 0114(0029)]
You need my help?
What is it?
Well, you see, I do not want anyone to overhear\nthis, but...[VAR 0114(0029)]
I hear rumors of an incredibly sweet condiment\nthat exists somewhere in the Paldea region.[VAR 0114(0029)]
I absolutely must experience that ambrosial\nsweetness for myself.[VAR 0114(0029)]
You are the only one who knows of my insatiable\nsweet tooth. Thus, I have no one else I can turn\r\nto for help in this matter.[VAR 0114(0029)]
I cannot go looking for this condiment myself lest\nI destroy the image students have of me.[VAR 0114(0029)]
I will repay you for your troubles, of course.\nGive it some thought if this piques your interest.[VAR 0114(0029)]
In the meantime, I will gather what information I\ncan about this incredibly sweet condiment.[VAR 0114(0029)]

It smells suuuper sweet! And you looked so\nhappy eating it!
N-no! You see, ah...there is a reason for this![VAR 0114(0029)]
You don’t LOOK like someone who likes sweets,\nbut that’s pretty cool!

All good! No questions!
What were you having trouble with? Let’s have a\nlittle review here, shall we?[VAR 0114(0025)]
Hahaha. I’m glad to hear it! Then perhaps you\nwon’t mind a little quiz.[VAR 0114(0025)]
Flying-type Pokémon are weak to Rock-type\nmoves.\c\nWhen a Rock-type move hits a Flying-type\nPokémon, what becomes of the move’s damage?[VAR 0114(0025)]
It stays the same
It’s doubled
It’s multiplied by 100
Yes, that’s right! The correct answer is that the\nmove’s damage is doubled.[VAR 0114(0025)]
Oh dear. The correct answer is that the move’s\ndamage is doubled. But I appreciate you trying![VAR 0114(0025)]
Ms. Tyme! Ms. Tyyyyyyme!

Were you perhaps watching me from afar\njust now?[VAR 0114(0025)]
No, I wasn’t
I just got here
Y-yes, I suppose you wouldn’t have been doing\nsomething like that. I’m sorry.[VAR 0114(0025)]
You see... Oh, how should I put this?[VAR 0114(0025)]
Recently, there have been times when I feel as if\nI am being watched...[VAR 0114(0025)]
Not by a Pokémon, mind you, but by a person.[VAR 0114(0025)]
I thought it might be a ghost, so I tried asking my\nsister for help. She said it most likely isn’t one.\r\nShe’s good with Ghost-type Pokémon, you know.[VAR 0114(0025)]
Perhaps one of my students is quietly watching\nme, waiting for a chance to ask me a question?[VAR 0114(0025)]
That might be it
Hmmm. Maybe?

Oh, no! I’m not here for anything food-related\nat all![VAR 0114(0025)]
I was just walking around the entrance hall...[VAR 0114(0025)]
and I felt that intense gaze that I told you\nabout before![VAR 0114(0025)]
So I quickly ducked into the cafeteria here.[VAR 0114(0025)]
Our cafeteria has only one entrance, so I thought\nI might be able to discover the identity of the\r\nperson watching me if they followed me in here![VAR 0114(0025)]
Ah! Someone’s come just now![VAR 0114(0025)]
Huh? That’s weird...I thought I saw her come\nin here.
I guess I won’t be able to ask my question today,\neither...
That girl...I feel like I’ve seen her several times\nbefore.[VAR 0114(0025)]
She seems to be a student here, but I get the\nfeeling that her question is not about her studies.[VAR 0114(0025)]
Next time I see her, maybe I’ll go start up a\nconversation myself![VAR 0114(0025)]
It could have been a little scary being here on my\nown. I’m glad you were here with me.[VAR 0114(0025)]

Well, you see, it’s not very pleasant knowing\nshe’s just staring at me all the time.[VAR 0114(0025)]

I guess you must have noticed me... I-I’m so sorry!
Well, of course I noticed—you were watching me\npractically all day every day, after all!\c\nI assume there’s something you want to ask me?[VAR 0114(0025)]
Y-yes...I do.
I’ve been a huge fan of yours since your time as\na Gym Leader! And I love Rock-type moves so\r\nvery much!
Oh, my...[VAR 0114(0025)]
But you just suddenly retired from your post as\nGym Leader a year and a half ago...\c\nWhy did you quit?!
My goodness... Is that all you wanted to ask?[VAR 0114(0025)]
Yes. Your reason for retiring was never\nmade public...
but it’s well known among the students here that\nyou just avoid the question any time it’s asked.
I thought it would be rude to ask you a question\nthat you don’t want to answer...so I just couldn’t\r\nfind the courage to ask.
So that’s why your gaze felt so very intense. I see.\nForgive me.[VAR 0114(0025)]
So very...intense?
Ah, never mind that. As for the reason I quit my\njob as Gym Leader, I simply wanted to focus\r\nmore on my job as a teacher.[VAR 0114(0025)]
It’s not that I disliked being a Gym Leader or\nanything of that sort.[VAR 0114(0025)]
Quite the contrary—talking about the Gym fills\nme with feelings of nostalgia and sadness.[VAR 0114(0025)]
That’s why I always avoid answering the question\nwhen students ask.[VAR 0114(0025)]
Oh. I see...
Do you have any plans of becoming a Gym\nLeader again?
No, I’m afraid I don’t plan to do so.[VAR 0114(0025)]
My sister is doing a splendid job as Gym Leader\nin my stead.[VAR 0114(0025)]
I personally find being a teacher most enjoyable\nthese days.[VAR 0114(0025)]
But since I am, in fact, your teacher...I would\nappreciate it if you would call me “Ms. Tyme,”\r\nas students do, and not just “Tyme.”[VAR 0114(0025)]
OK. I’m sad to hear that, but I understand!
Thank you so much, Ms. Tyme!
Well, I suppose that solves the mystery![VAR 0114(0025)]
Ahhh, that made me so nervous! I said so many\nthings to try to sound cool![VAR 0114(0025)]
I was certainly a little scared when I felt that girl’s\nintense gaze on me.[VAR 0114(0025)]
But having you here with me allowed me to do\nwhat needed to be done to face what turned out\r\nto be one of my biggest fans.[VAR 0114(0025)]
I must thank you for always showing up at just the\nright time, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0025)]
Allow me to show you my appreciation a little.\nI hope these help on your adventure.[VAR 0114(0025)]
You formed a close bond with Ms. Tyme!

Maybe it’s way up high on a cliff or something?\c\n...Nah, that’s impossible!\c\nI don’t think it’d be hiding somewhere that tricky,\nso don’t go falling off any cliffs or anything trying\r\nto search it out somewhere too strange.\c\nMaybe just give your map app a look if you’re\nfeeling stumped? It’s pretty handy![VAR 0114(0006)]

Good morning, and welcome to the Pokémon\nCenter! Do your precious Pokémon need a rest?
Hello, and welcome to the Pokémon Center!\nAre your Pokémon tired and in need of rest?
Welcome to the Pokémon Center! Still up and\nabout? Are you here to rest your tired Pokémon?
[VAR BD06(0000)]Morning, Champion [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nHere\r\nto\r\nlet\r\nyour\r\nprecious\r\nPokémon rest?
[VAR BD06(0000)]Hello, Champion [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nHere\r\nto\r\nlet\r\nyour\r\ntired\r\nPokémon rest?

I’d like to heal my Pokémon
I don’t know where to go...
Can I register my birthday?
I’m all good!
Then we’ll need your Pokémon for a few seconds!
[VAR BD06(0000)]Your [VAR 0101(0000)] should be all\nbetter now!
[VAR BD06(0000)][VAR 0101(0000)] and the rest of\nyour\r\nteam\r\nshould\r\nbe all\r\nbetter now!
Come back and see us again whenever you need!
Oh, and I went ahead and charged up your\nTera Orb too.
Right! Let’s see—if I had to recommend a next\ndestination for you...
I’d guess a fresh-faced student belongs in school!\c\nHead to Naranja Academy, why don’t you?\nYou must be excited to join your class!
I’d guess a fresh-faced student belongs in school!\c\nHead to Uva Academy, why don’t you? You must\nbe excited to join your class!
I’d guess there are still corners of the academy\nyou haven’t checked out.\c\nDon’t be afraid to visit different rooms—\nwho knows who you’ll end up meeting!
I’d guess there are still corners of the academy\nyou haven’t checked out.\c\nDon’t be afraid to go into different rooms—\nwho knows who you’ll end up meeting!
...Nope! Sorry, I’ve got nothing!\c\nYou’re ready for anything Paldea could possibly\nthrow at you, so I’d say go wherever you’d like!
You should pay a visit to the Cortondo Gym!\c\nHave you considered trying to take on Gym\nLeader Katy in charming Cortondo?
I’d recommend the Artazon Gym!\c\nHave you thought about taking on Gym Leader\nBrassius? He’s in picturesque Artazon!
Well, how about the Cascarrafa Gym?\c\nYou could try taking on Gym Leader Kofu in\nrefreshing Cascarrafa!
I’d aim for the Levincia Gym!\c\nYou could try challenging Gym Leader Iono in\nthe dazzling city of Levincia!
I think you’d better visit the Medali Gym!\c\nYou could try taking on Gym Leader Larry next.\nYou’ll find him in good old Medali.
I’d say it’s time for the Glaseado Gym.\c\nWhat do you think of challenging Gym Leader\nGrusha up on Glaseado Mountain?
I think you should try the Montenevera Gym next.\c\nYou could try challenging Gym Leader Ryme\nin chilly Montenevera!
I’d say, how about the Alfornada Gym?\c\nHave you considered taking on Gym Leader Tulip\nin scorching Alfornada?
I’d say make for the lair of the Rock-type Titan!\c\nWhy not try to seek out the Pokémon known as\nthe Stony Cliff Titan?
I’d say make for the lair of the Steel-type Titan!\c\nMaybe try seeking out the Pokémon known as\nthe Lurking Steel Titan?
I’d say make for the lair of the Flying-type Titan!\c\nThink you might be up to seeking out the\nso-called Open Sky Titan?
I’d say make for the lair of the Ground-type Titan!\c\nDo you dare seek out the Pokémon that has been\ncalled the Quaking Earth Titan?
I’d say make for the lair of the Dragon-type Titan!\c\nWhy not seek out the Pokémon called the\nFalse Dragon Titan?
It’d be the base of Team Star’s Fairy crew!\c\nOrtega, the boss of the Ruchbah Squad, would\nprobably welcome a challenge, from what I hear.
It’d be the base of Team Star’s Dark crew!\c\nI hear Giacomo, the boss of the Segin Squad,\nis just waiting for someone to battle.
It’d be the base of Team Star’s Fire crew!\c\nSeems like Mela, the boss of the Schedar Squad,\nis burning for someone to battle against.
It’d be the base of Team Star’s Poison crew!\c\nAtticus, the boss of the Navi Squad, is apparently\nwaiting for someone to battle.
It’d be the base of Team Star’s Fighting crew!\c\nI’m pretty sure Eri, the boss of the Caph Squad,\ncould use a good challenge in battle.
Go to Area Zero in the Great Crater of Paldea!\c\nI think you’ve got some tried-and-true friends\nwaiting for you there.
I’ll go ahead and mark the spot in your map app\nfor you.
You’ve got a destination set in your map app\nalready. Is it OK if I replace it with this one?
All right...you’re all set! Go out there and have\nan adventure—we’ll be here when you need us!
All righty—I’ll leave your map be! Have fun\nexploring, and we’ll be here when you need us!
Feliz cumpleaños! Congratulations on your\nbirthday!\c\nI do hope you keep visiting the Pokémon Center\nfor many years to come!\c\nNow, are you here to let your Pokémon rest?
[~ 134]
Happy birthday, [VAR 0100(0000)]!
I do hope this will be a wonderful year for you—\neach and every day!
Oh, today is a special day, isn’t it?\c\nI know it’s actually a day early, but we wish you\na very happy birthday!
First, let’s restore your Pokémon to full health.
Be sure to visit a Pokémon Center whenever your\nPokémon [VAR 1101(00FD,0302)]isare running low on HP.\c\nAnd if you’re planning to go far off the beaten\npath, you should probably remember to stock\r\nup on Potions from the Poké Mart, too.\c\nGood luck out there, Trainer!
Your Pokémon [VAR 1101(00FD,0302)]isare all happy and healthy again!\nGood luck out there, and take care!
Study hard and play hard, that’s what I say!\nYou should enjoy your days as a student.[VAR 0114(002B)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Oh, good to have you home,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nYour Pokémon [VAR 1101(00FD,0302)]isare looking a bit weary, though.\nWhy don’t you have a nice rest together?\c\n... ... ...\n... ... ...[VAR 0114(002B)]
There you are! A nice long nap is all a body\nneeds to feel ready for more adventure, right?\c\nDoesn’t matter whether you’re a person or a\nPokémon—we all need to take time to rest.[VAR 0114(002B)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Certainly! Allow me to get your birthday\nregistered in our system,\r\n[VAR 0100(0000)]!
Now, do be careful you enter it right. You can’t\nchange your birthday after it’s registered.
So I’ve got here a birthday of [VAR 0201(0001)]/[VAR 0201(0002)] for one\nM[VAR 1100(00FF,0305)]asteriss [VAR 0100(0000)]. Is that right?
That’s right!
Let me change it
Never mind
Thanks for registering your birthday with the\nPokémon Center!
You should stop by on your big day, too!\nWe’ll be expecting you on [VAR 0201(0001)]/[VAR 0201(0002)]!
Oh, and if your very special birthday isn’t on the\ncalendar this year, then please come on 2/28!
Oh! By the way—did you know...?
Or did you already know that? Well, I do hope\nmy little tidbits come in handy!
With all the little tidbits that I’ve shared with you\nso far, [VAR 0100(0000)]...\c\nyou should now know just about everything you\nneed as you go adventuring!\c\nFlip back through your Adventure Guide from\ntime to time, though, as you enjoy exploring!
Now that you have a Hall of Fame Badge,\nI’ve unlocked the Judge function for you.

Morning. This here’s the Pokémon Center.\nDo your precious Pokémon maybe need a rest?
Hey there. This is the Pokémon Center. Are your\nPokémon tired and needing a rest?
Still up and about? Well, this is your Pokémon\nCenter. Wanna rest your tired Pokémon?
’K, I’ll take them here for a sec.
[VAR BD06(0000)]Your [VAR 0101(0000)]\nshould\r\nbe\r\nall\r\nbetter\r\nnow.
[VAR BD06(0000)][VAR 0101(0000)] and the rest of\nyour\r\nteam\r\nshould\r\nbe all\r\nbetter\r\nnow.
Come back whenever you need.
Oh, and I went ahead and charged up that\nTera Orb thing too.
First, let’s restore your Pokémon to full health.
You know, you’d better visit a Pokémon Center\nwhenever your Pokémon [VAR 1101(00FD,0302)]isare running low on HP.\c\nAnd you should stock up on, like, lotsa Potions\nand stuff at Peachy’s or wherever.
Anyway, I healed up your Pokémon—all happy\nand healthy again.\c\nI’m glad they’re all OK. Be more careful out\nthere, would ya?
Whoa. Gimme some room to breathe here,\nwould ya?\c\nIf you want me to heal your Pokémon, I’m gonna\nneed you over on the other side of the counter.
Y’know...I keep seeing you around here,\nso I thought I’d ask...
Has anyone taught you the new pose that\neverybody’s using in their selfies nowadays?\r\nIt’s like a double peace sign but with a twist.
You learned the [VAR FF00(0008)]Upside-Down Peace emote [VAR FF00(0000)]from\nthe Pokémon Center lady!
Maybe give it a try sometime, if you feel like it.
Y’know...you sure do visit me a whole lot. I’d\nsay you’ve probably earned another sweet tip.
So when you’re taking a selfie, right? Try holding\na Poké Ball up all close to your face.\c\nIt’ll make you look super cute. You should try it.
You learned the [VAR FF00(0008)]Poké Ball emote [VAR FF00(0000)]from the\nPokémon Center lady!
If you’re feeling like you need just a touch more\ncute in a shot, you should give it a try.
Oh, and that’s right—I have a new tip to share\nwith you!
With all the little tidbits that I’ve shared with you\ntill now, [VAR 0100(0000)]...\c\nyou probably know just about everything you\nought to know about adventuring, for real!\c\nFlip back through your Adventure Guide from\ntime to time, though, as you enjoy exploring!
What would you like to do?
Your [VAR 0101(0000)] is all better now!
[VAR 0101(0000)] and your other Pokémon are\nall better now!
And it looks like your Tera Orb got charged too!
Oh no! Are you OK?! We’d better get your\nPokémon healed up at once!
You should be a bit more diligent in healing up\nyour Pokémon when they’re getting weak.\c\nIt helps if you load up on Potions from the\nvending machine!
Looks like your Pokémon [VAR 1101(00FD,0302)]isare all healed now.\nTime to get back to adventuring!
If you use the machine next to me here, you can\nget your Pokémon healed in a jiffy.
Quit
Something weird seems to be going on here in\nthe village...\c\nYou might want to let your Pokémon rest up\nwhenever you get the chance.

My compadre...[VAR 0114(0023)]
[~ 61]
[~ 61]
I owe you a great debt.[VAR 0114(0023)]
It seems we’re one step closer to the truth behind\nTeam Star’s truancy—and the bullying at the\r\nacademy. But more importantly...[VAR 0114(001E)]
I can’t believe I had no idea about these issues\nthe students are struggling with...\c\nThey have friendships they hold dear and reasons\nfor acting as they do. I just couldn’t see it.[VAR 0114(001E)]
It’s shameful how oblivious I’ve been.[VAR 0114(001E)]
[~ 61]
Haaah... I believ’d Team Star to be the one and\nonly treasure in my life...[VAR 0114(0023)]
Methinks I may have been mistaken.[VAR 0114(0023)]

It’s great that the schoolyard’s so big! Even huge\nPokémon have plenty of space to come out!
If you stare at Gyarados’s face, it might lower\nyour Attack with Intimidate!
I heard that Tropius loves fruit so much it started\ngrowing fruit on its neck!\c\nThat can’t be true, right?!
The dishes at the cafeteria all use ingredients\ngrown here!
Whether with Pokémon or with gardening, you\nend up asking yourself: What should I raise next?
Cyclizar is so glossy and cute! It really helps take\nthe stress of studying away.
I’ve started a Cyclizar therapy service. Stare at it\nfor as long as you’d like!
I was just running with Mudbray—its stamina is\nsomething else!
I’m about to have a Pokémon battle with my\nfriend!
Friends know each other’s tricks! When we battle,\nit’s all about anticipating one another’s strategy!
I couldn’t sleep, so I thought I’d take a walk\naround the school.
I saw Nemona win 30 Pokémon battles in a row\nhere at the schoolyard the other day!\c\nShe definitely deserves that Champion Rank\nof hers!
Nemona’s the student council president, and a\nChampion, and has top-notch grades...\c\nIs there anything she can’t do?
I’m just picturing what it’d be like to battle on\na court so that I don’t get nervous at Gyms!
It took a lot of effort to get Magikarp to evolve\ninto Gyarados, let me tell you...
Gengar smiles even while it’s sleeping. Isn’t that\njust the most adorable thing ever?
I’ve seen a student with a weird hairdo come out\nof the director’s office now and then...

If it’s Mr. Jacq you’re after, you should try the\nbiology lab. That’s usually where you’ll find him.
Director Clavell is an inspiration. He never talks\ndown to anyone even though he’s so important.\r\nI hope I can be a great man like him someday.

If your Pokémon get injured, you can bring them\nhere to the nurse’s office to get healed up.
I come here to take a breather when I’m feeling\ndown about stuff from class.\c\nNurse Miriam always lets me stay without making\nme explain or anything. She’s so nice.
The students call Nurse Miriam “Mimi”!\nI tried using that nickname with her once...\r\nbut she just glared at me.

I thought I might come see what this was about,\nsince I was invited by a fellow true artist like\r\n[VAR 0100(0000)]-garde...[VAR 0114(0017)]
But my word! The design of this room!\c\nIt goes beyond all pedestrian understanding of\nwhat a room should be! Truly avant-garde![VAR 0114(0017)]
[VAR BD06(0000)][VAR 0100(0000)], I thank you for\ninviting\r\nme\r\nto\r\nthis\r\nplace.[VAR 0114(0017)]
I only recently finished my latest piece, and so\nI rushed over to find a bit of rest and reprieve.[VAR 0114(0017)]
It seems that no matter the region, the wild\ncreature known as the “adolescent” changes\r\nlittle, no?[VAR 0114(0017)]
But that dome! That magnificent Terarium!\c\nIt’s the perfect “mariage” of environments,\ninspiring in me an unyielding desire to create![VAR 0114(0017)]
That’s really great!
You mean “marriage”?
How curious it is that my happiness should bring\nyou happiness as well![VAR 0114(0017)]
No, I mean “mariage”—the perfect blending of\ndifferent elements that results in great art! No\r\nword in our native tongue conveys such elegance![VAR 0114(0017)]
I would love to climb up to that mysterious objet\nd’art dangling from the ceil of the dome.\c\nWhat sights I might gaze down upon from there![VAR 0114(0017)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Apropos of nothing, [VAR 0100(0000)],\nI\r\nmust\r\nask—![VAR 0114(0017)]
There is another famed artist here in the Unova\nregion. Do you know of him?[VAR 0114(0017)]
Of course I do!
I have no idea
Oh, how broad and rich your education is!\nYes, I suspected you would already know...[VAR 0114(0017)]
Is that right! Well, if you do not know, I simply\nmust inform you![VAR 0114(0017)]
I speak of that famed painter of bug Pokémon,\nwhose works have such depth and pathos![VAR 0114(0017)]
I find myself quite curious about him, as it seems\nthat we may be alike in temperament.\c\nWe both strive to propel ourselves to the height\nof artistic creation by focusing on a single type...[VAR 0114(0017)]
I’ve heard he maintains a gallery of his work in\nCastelia City. Perhaps I shall pay it a visit...[VAR 0114(0017)]
I visited the gallery of that famed painter I spoke\nof before. The one in Castelia City.[VAR 0114(0017)]
It was truly...avant-garde![VAR 0114(0017)]
There was silk like Tarountula’s, spun into\nmasterful sculptures that whisk one around like\r\nfantastic elevators![VAR 0114(0017)]
I rode up and down countless times for the sheer\njoy of it![VAR 0114(0017)]
Upon which I gradually became all tangled up in\nthe webbing and was transformed into a cocoon![VAR 0114(0017)]
That’s right... Before I even realized what was\nhappening, I myself had become a part of the\r\nfibrous art. It was wondrous![VAR 0114(0017)]
That sounds great!
I don’t get it
[VAR BD06(0000)]Yes, you and I truly understand one another!\nYou should come join me as an apprentice in the\r\nfuture, [VAR 0100(0000)]! I’ll teach you\r\nall\r\nI know![VAR 0114(0017)]
You fail to understand? Hmm. Now I wonder if\nwhat I experienced was perhaps not intended by\r\nthe artist...[VAR 0114(0017)]
You know, now that I think back on my visit, that\ngallery had no paintings on display.\c\nWas it truly an art gallery at all?[VAR 0114(0017)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Hahahaha! I suppose it matters naught! Talking to\nyou, [VAR 0100(0000)], is a pleasure\r\nregardless—one\r\nthat\r\nmakes\r\nme\r\nforget\r\ntime\r\nis\r\neven\r\npassing.[VAR 0114(0017)]
I imagine you must feel the same!\c\nAnd for such a like-minded ally in art, I have a\nproposal to make...[VAR 0114(0017)]
Would you like to engage in an artistic exchange\nof Pokémon with me?[VAR 0114(0017)]
Very good, [VAR 0100(0000)]-garde!\c\nI will offer up one of my Sunflora! How will you\nmeet such a challenge?![VAR 0114(0017)]
[VAR 0101(0001)]! What a beguiling choice.\c\nI can feel inspiration welling up within me! Your\neye for beauty delights me once again![VAR 0114(0017)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Will you exchange your [VAR 0101(0001)] for my\nSunflora?[VAR 0114(0017)]
You can’t trade Brassius a Pokémon if you\naren’t its original Trainer!
You can’t trade Brassius such a rare Pokémon!
You can’t trade Brassius a Shiny Pokémon!
Wait, no! Have you taken leave of your senses?!\nYou can’t trade with only a single Pokémon!\c\nBe certain you have at least two Pokémon in your\nparty if you wish to make our exchange![VAR 0114(0017)]
A Pokémon trade is an exchange of lives. It is\nwise to give it all due consideration.[VAR 0114(0017)]
Have you decided you would like to trade with\nme after all?[VAR 0114(0017)]
I have some time before my next lecture. Care to\ncollaborate with me in the art of battle?[VAR 0114(0017)]
There’s nothing to be done about it if you lack\nthe necessary passion. I will not force you.[VAR 0114(0017)]
Superb! Then let us move to the entrance of the\nschool with great artistic flair![VAR 0114(0017)]
[~ 61]
Hahahaha! You have claimed an artistic win![VAR 0114(0017)]
Our collaborations are always the greatest of\nworks! Your sense for art is honed to perfection![VAR 0114(0017)]
My thanks to you.\c\nI will bestow on you the latest merchandise to be\nsold at my exhibits. You’ll be the first to get one.[VAR 0114(0017)]
It took the designers over six months to meet my\nexacting standards, but at last we made true art.[VAR 0114(0017)]
You received a [VAR FF00(0008)]Surrendering Sunflora Case [VAR FF00(0000)]from\nBrassius!
Hahahaha! What an artistic defeat!\c\nSince you’ve already gotten the best of me, you\nmight as well take a little more![VAR 0114(0017)]
I can’t hold back this flood of inspiration... Leave\nme here, so I might continue to savor this feeling![VAR 0114(0017)]
So this time you served to nourish my Pokémon!\c\nThe occasional defeat is a necessarily evil. Our\npain can inspire the greatest art![VAR 0114(0017)]
The architecture of this academy displays a great\nsense of design.\c\nI would like to know the name of the architect\nwho devised it...[VAR 0114(0017)]
In Pokémon battles, there will be times of\nstruggle. The same is true of art.\c\nBut you must not abandon these pursuits. It is\nwhen you stop struggling that you wither away.[VAR 0114(0017)]
You have had the opportunity to take Hass’s\nclasses back in Paldea, have you not?\c\nYou should be aware of how lucky you are as you\nmake your way in life.[VAR 0114(0017)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]I’d love to do a carving of the [VAR 0101(0001)]\nyou\r\nentrusted\r\nme with, at some point.\c\nIt is truly avant-garde![VAR 0114(0017)]
Is the Sunflora I entrusted you with flourishing?\c\nYou must be diligent in ensuring he gets enough\nsunlight and water.[VAR 0114(0017)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]La Primera stopped by to whisper a little secret\nin my ear, not long ago.\c\nShe said that when you were asked to name your\nfavorite Gym Leader, you said it was me!\c\nIf I’ve been deemed worthy by your great eye,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]-garde, I can aspire no\r\nhigher!\c\nLet our next collaboration together be one that\nI dedicate to the theme of “Gratitude”![VAR 0114(0017)]

Heya! Step right up![VAR 0114(0018)]
Kofu, the Surging Chef, here to deliver yer order![VAR 0114(0018)]
Vaultin’ Veluza! Fancy runnin’ into you again![VAR 0114(0018)]
Yer still a student, ain’tcha? Yet here you are,\ngettin’ to invite special coaches and everything![VAR 0114(0018)]
Yer really somethin’ else, kid![VAR 0114(0018)]
Yep, I’m somethin’ else!
It’s not that big of a deal...
Gahaha! You’ve got the confidence to match yer\nstrength, I see! What a great catch indeed![VAR 0114(0018)]
Gahaha! What’s the point of denyin’ that a big\ndeal’s a big deal?! Bein’ humble only goes so\r\nfar, kid![VAR 0114(0018)]
Anyway, thanks for givin’ me the chance to come\nall the way out here![VAR 0114(0018)]
Ol’ man Kofu’s gonna learn somethin’ along with\nthe kids, lemme tell ya![VAR 0114(0018)]
This place is great, surrounded by the sea an’ all.\nCan’t imagine a better location![VAR 0114(0018)]
Feelin’ the sea breeze puts a bit o’ spring in my\nstep—in my Pokémon’s, too![VAR 0114(0018)]
That bein’ said, I couldn’t help but notice there’s\na lack of seafood on the cafeteria menu...[VAR 0114(0018)]
Don’t ya think it’d make the students here happy\nif they could eat their fill of seafood, freshly\r\nbrought in from the ocean on their doorstep?[VAR 0114(0018)]
I bet they’d love it!
I think the menu’s fine as is...
Excellent! Now that I got yer endorsement, it’s\ntime fer ol’ man Kofu to work his magic![VAR 0114(0018)]
I can understand wantin’ junk food now an’ then,\nbut variety is the spice o’ life, as they say![VAR 0114(0018)]
Just you wait—the fingerlings here need a proper\nmeal, and Kofu Lounge is gonna provide it![VAR 0114(0018)]
There ya are! I’ve got some news that’s sure to\nrock yer boat![VAR 0114(0018)]
This ol’ man’s managed to land a collaboration\nbetween the Kofu Lounge and the Blueberry\r\nAcademy cafeteria![VAR 0114(0018)]
That’s amazing!
I can’t wait!
’Course, we only just settled on the deal. It’ll\ntake some time ’fore things really get goin’![VAR 0114(0018)]
My first order o’ business is to rework the Kofu\nLounge’s House Special Hot Pot a bit—make it\r\nmore suited to the students here![VAR 0114(0018)]
Growin’ kids deserve the best food, after all![VAR 0114(0018)]
Heh—lookit ol’ Kofu. I was just doin’ what came\nnaturally, and now here I am teachin’ nutrition![VAR 0114(0018)]
What a catch! Thanks to yer callin’ me here, I get\nto learn alongside the kids![VAR 0114(0018)]
I’m in your debt, kid! Gahaha![VAR 0114(0018)]
Whaddya say we go with the flow and trade\nPokémon while we’re here, eh?[VAR 0114(0018)]
Gahaha! Well, I’ll be lettin’ loose my Veluza!\nHow ’bout you, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0018)]
A lively [VAR 0101(0001)]! What a great catch!\c\nDon’t you worry—this ol’ man’s gonna take real\ngood care of this darlin’![VAR 0114(0018)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]You wanna trade your [VAR 0101(0001)] for my\nVeluza?[VAR 0114(0018)]
You can’t trade Kofu a Pokémon if you aren’t its\noriginal Trainer!
You can’t trade Kofu such a rare Pokémon!
You can’t trade Kofu a Shiny Pokémon!
Hold it, kid! Ya can’t trade if you’ve only got one\nPokémon with ya!\c\nBetter go get at least two on yer team ’fore you\ntry a trade![VAR 0114(0018)]
Vaultin’ Veluza! Didn’t expect you to say no![VAR 0114(0018)]
Are ya gonna trade Pokémon with this ol’ man\nafter all?![VAR 0114(0018)]
Step right up!\c\nWhy not have a lively battle with ol’ man Kofu?[VAR 0114(0018)]
Aw, that’s too bad...\n*sniffle*[VAR 0114(0018)]
I’ve caught myself a whopper! Let’s head on up\nto the entrance, then![VAR 0114(0018)]
[~ 58]
There’s no stoppin’ the force you muster! It’s like\nwatchin’ a Magikarp swim up a waterfall![VAR 0114(0018)]
Facin’ young’uns like yerself helps this ol’ man\nlearn and grow, too![VAR 0114(0018)]
Here’s a little somethin’ for ya! Its spice packs a\nreal wallop—jus’ like you, kid![VAR 0114(0018)]
You come back to see me again now, ya hear?[VAR 0114(0018)]
[~ 58]
Vaultin’ Veluza! Seems like I was the one reeled\nin this time![VAR 0114(0018)]
Ol’ man Kofu’s always ready for the next battle!\nLookin’ forward to it, in fact![VAR 0114(0018)]
I am Kofu the Torrent! Ever changin’—just like\nwater! And you can’t even fathom my depths\r\njust yet! Gahahahaha![VAR 0114(0018)]
I LOVE the colors here at Blueberry Academy!\nSuch clear blues—just like Cascarrafa![VAR 0114(0018)]
Didja see those li’l flowers bloomin’ in the\nTerarium? Such precious things, doin’ their\r\nabsolute darndest![VAR 0114(0018)]
Lemme tell ya, gettin’ a chance to work with\nstudents has been a real learnin’ experience!\c\nYou’ve got no idea how many cool new poses\nI’ve picked up! What a haul![VAR 0114(0018)]

That Veluza I let loose on ya has got a real\nsharpness to her! Better watch out, though—\r\nsometimes she’ll go and self-serve sashimi![VAR 0114(0018)]
Gahaha! Geeta spilled the beans, y’know!\c\nSo you chose ol’ man Kofu as your favorite\nGym Leader, eh? That was a flash flood o’ joy,\r\nlemme tell ya.\c\nDon’tcha worry, kid—yer a dear friend o’\nmine, too![VAR 0114(0018)]

[VAR BD06(0000)]Welcome to the Medali Gym,\n[VAR 0100(0000)].
If you want to face Gym Leader Larry, please\nspeak to the waiter at the Treasure Eatery.
[VAR BD06(0000)]Ah, [VAR 0100(0000)]! Welcome to the\nTreasure\r\nEatery—proud\r\nto\r\nbe\r\nsupporting\r\nthe\r\nMedali Gym!
Do you want to face the Exceptional Everyman\nhimself, Gym Leader Larry?
In that case, please head onto the battle court.
Please feel free to come back whenever you\nare ready.
Laaarrryyy! You’re up!
Hello.[VAR 0114(002C)]
I’m Larry. I’m assigned to work as the Gym\nLeader of the Medali Gym.[VAR 0114(0015)]
Good job on making your way through the\nGym Test.[VAR 0114(0015)]
And, well...maybe try the other dishes on the\nmenu too sometime. Everything’s good here.[VAR 0114(0015)]
Anyway, my boss will dock my pay if I spend too\nmuch time chitchatting.\c\nLet’s get this battle over with.[VAR 0114(0015)]
Thank you for doing business with us today.\nI, Larry, will be at your service.[VAR 0114(0015)]
You’re rather strong, aren’t you? Enough to bring\nout my poker face, even.[VAR 0114(0015)]
I lost, so that means I have to give you a\nbadge, but...[VAR 0114(0015)]
That battle made me a bit hungry. Care to join\nme for a meal?[VAR 0114(0015)]
Having [VAR 0200(0001)] Gym Badge[VAR 1101(0001,0100)]s in hand makes it easier to\ncatch Pokémon of up to Lv. [VAR 0201(0002)].\c\nOh, and they’ll actually listen to you, too...[VAR 0114(0015)]
If you have 8 Gym Badges, you’ll be able to\ncatch Pokémon of any level. They’ll never\r\nquestion who’s the boss, either.[VAR 0114(0015)]
The dishes here... They’ve all got flavor.\nGood flavor, I mean.[VAR 0114(0015)]
This is for you. Though hopefully a child like you\nhas no need to put on its namesake...[VAR 0114(0015)]
Oh, don’t worry about the bill. I do earn a salary,\nafter all.[VAR 0114(0015)]
Now, I’d better get back to work. If you’ll\nexcuse me.[VAR 0114(0015)]
Congratulations! You’re now certified by the\nMedali Gym!

Gyah! What—? [VAR 0100(0000)]?![VAR 0114(0008)]
Hurry up and hide! And keep quiet, OK?[VAR 0114(0008)]
Phew... That was close.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Whatcha doing?
Something up?
Um... Yeah, you know, I’m just... Errr...\c\n*sigh*\nGuess I might as well come clean.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Take a look over there.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Do you get it now?[VAR 0114(0008)]
...Not really?
A little context, please?
Ah. Sorry. Your jump scare earlier completely\nfrazzled me. My brain’s still trying to reboot.[VAR 0114(0008)]
All right, here’s the sitch. Team Star’ve started\ncoming to school again...[VAR 0114(0008)]
But I don’t know if they’re gonna fit in OK, and\nit’s been playing on my mind, you know?\r\nSo I’m checking on them from over here...[VAR 0114(0008)]
Hmph... Guess we’re still not exactly gettin’ a\nwarm welcome here, huh?[VAR 0114(0021)]
Well, duh.[VAR 0114(0020)]
Sure, the teachers finally figured out we’re not a\nbunch of delinquents...[VAR 0114(0020)]
But it’s not like we can press some magic button\nto make everyone else accept us.[VAR 0114(0020)]
True story. We gotta fix this, my man. Time for a\nchange of tack![VAR 0114(0021)]
Huh? A change of tack...?\c\nWhat, are they gonna start wearing normal school\nuniforms so they stop scaring off the other kids?[VAR 0114(0008)]
Oh, Momo... Ortie... They’re both really trying\ntheir best to fit in here at school...[VAR 0114(0008)]
A “change of tack,” huh? What exactly are\nyou suggesting?[VAR 0114(0020)]
Buh? I mean, uhhh...[VAR 0114(0021)]
How ’bout we say a big, friendly howdy to\neveryone here? Like, just yell it. Loud as we can.[VAR 0114(0021)]
WHAT?! That’s stupid! Go on and embarrass\nyourself if you want to, but count me out![VAR 0114(0020)]
Errr. Yeah, that idea seems a bit...off.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Hold up—lemme explain.[VAR 0114(0021)]
You know Ryme, right? She does this at her\nconcerts, no joke.[VAR 0114(0021)]
If the crowd ain’t hyped at the start of the show,\nshe’ll shout the loudest greetin’ you ever heard\r\ninto the mike. Like “S’UP Y’ALL” or whatever!\c\nLifts the mood like nobody’s business.[VAR 0114(0021)]
Yeah, that makes sense. ’Cause those are\nCONCERTS. This is SCHOOL. It’s different.[VAR 0114(0020)]
OK, smart guy. So we’re optin’ for the cold\nshoulder treatment forever, then, are we?[VAR 0114(0021)]
N-no... That’d totally suck.[VAR 0114(0020)]
It would, wouldn’t it? So yeah. Our only option is\nto yell at everyone so they know we’re nice.\r\nHere, I’m gonna go for it...[VAR 0114(0021)]
HEEEY!!! MORNIN’, Y’AAAAAALL!!!\nHOW WE ALL FEELIN’ TODAAAY??!![VAR 0114(0021)]
Oh nooo! Giacomo! What are you DOING?!\nThis is SO embarrassing![VAR 0114(0020)]
EVERYONE HAVIN’ A GOOD TIIIIIIME??!!\nC’mon, Ortega—you gotta do it, too![VAR 0114(0021)]
Hold on a sec! You...you’re just practicing for\nyour DJ sets, aren’t you?[VAR 0114(0020)]
THANKS FOR COMIN’ TONIGHT!!!\nQuick! Say it![VAR 0114(0021)]
TH-THANKS FOR COMING TONIGHT!!![VAR 0114(0020)]
...HEY! What do you mean, “thanks for coming”?!\nWe’re not hosting anything![VAR 0114(0020)]
What. On. Earth.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Are those guys from Team Star? What the heck\nare they yelling for?
Is this some kind of skit? Heh...they’re pretty\nfunny!
I guess they’re not as scary as I thought...?
No way...[VAR 0114(0008)]
P-people are actually warming up to them?!\nWhy? That makes zero sense![VAR 0114(0008)]
Haaah... Momo and Ortie really are operating\non a different level. I’m kind of amazed.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Seems all my worrying was for nothing, huh?[VAR 0114(0008)]
Now that that’s all settled, I guess I should get\ngoing. Hasta la vistar! ☆[VAR 0114(0008)]

*whisper*\nOh hey, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0008)]
*whisper*\nI’m checking in on Atticus.\c\n*whisper*\nSo keep your voice down, OK?[VAR 0114(0008)]
Okeydokey
*whisper whisper*
*whisper*\n’Preciate it.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Hmmmmmm...[VAR 0114(0023)]
I must say, the academy emporium stocks some\nrather splendid wares.[VAR 0114(0023)]
I admit my expectations were far lower\nthan warranted.[VAR 0114(0023)]
Wow. He really seems to have taken a shine to\nthe school store...[VAR 0114(0008)]
Doesn’t seem like he’ll notice us anytime soon,\nso I guess there’s no point whispering.[VAR 0114(0008)]
You know, of all my Team Star friends, it’s Atticus\nI’m worried will have the most trouble fitting in...[VAR 0114(0008)]
Greetings, my good shopkeep.[VAR 0114(0023)]
I would very much like to acquire the limited-\nedition ninja garments released today.\c\nI believe you have five sets in stock, yes?[VAR 0114(0023)]
Ah... The ninja cosplay set, yes?
I’m sorry, dear, but someone bought the last two\nfrom us earlier. We’re completely sold out.
What?! This cannot be!!![VAR 0114(0023)]
If I am unable to procure those garments, why...\nI... That will ruin everything![VAR 0114(0023)]
It appears I have no choice but to track down\nthis rival patron of mine! And when I find them...[VAR 0114(0023)]
I shall fix them with my piercing gaze and beg on\nbended knee for the ninja garments I so crave![VAR 0114(0023)]
Whaaaaaat?! Since WHEN was Atticus this\ngood-looking?![VAR 0114(0008)]
Wait, no, focus! If he starts begging some kid for\ntheir ninja outfit, people will think he’s a weirdo.\r\nWe should stop him, right?[VAR 0114(0008)]
Yeah, time for an intervention
Let’s just see how this pans out
Th-then that’s what we’ll do![VAR 0114(0008)]
Seriously? But...[VAR 0114(0008)]
Oh, Don Atticus! Here you are!
My young compadre![VAR 0114(0023)]
I...I must apologize.[VAR 0114(0023)]
About the garments I promised you so that we\nmight dress as ninja together...[VAR 0114(0023)]
Oh yeah, I got us covered! I already bought two\nsets of that ninja cosplay stuff for us to wear!
...I beg your pardon?[VAR 0114(0023)]
When I came here earlier, the shopkeeper lady\nwas putting them out on the shelves.\c\nSo I bought one for you and one for me!
You know how popular these outfits are...\nI was super lucky to be able to snag ’em!
Now c’mon! Let’s go play ninja outside!
Goodness me... What a happy turn of events![VAR 0114(0023)]
I shall retrieve my shuriken from my quarters\nso that we might enjoy some target practice![VAR 0114(0023)]
Ooooooh! Awesome!
I can also use my masterful stitchery to transform\nthy ninja garments into a sublime vision of poison!\r\nWhat say you?[VAR 0114(0023)]
Ummm... I’m good, thanks.
Ha ha ha! The insolence of this one![VAR 0114(0023)]
Phew... Looks like he was able to wrap up this\nlittle escapade without making a scene.[VAR 0114(0008)]
But more importantly—Atticus has already made\na friend at school![VAR 0114(0008)]
Kinda makes me feel bad that I thought I had to\nspy on him...[VAR 0114(0008)]
Anyway, I guess I’ll get going. Hasta la vistar! ☆[VAR 0114(0008)]

H-how you doing, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0008)]
I’ve never been inside the art room before.\nIt smells like paint in here—but in a good way.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Something up?
What brings you here?
Um. Well...[VAR 0114(0008)]
I’m worried about this rumor that’s going round.\c\nPeople are saying Team Star’s planning to raid\nthe art room or something.[VAR 0114(0008)]
It’s probably just rubbish made up by some kids\nwho are still scared of Team Star though.[VAR 0114(0008)]
My friends would never do anything like that.\nAnd who’d want to raid the art room, anyway?[VAR 0114(0008)]
Knock knock! We’re comin’ in!!![VAR 0114(001F)]
GAH! They actually showed up?![VAR 0114(0008)]
Wow, this Staraptor is incredible! It looks just like\nit’s about to attack with Close Combat![VAR 0114(0022)]
Hey. You with the art club or what?[VAR 0114(001F)]
Uh, y-yeah, I am...?
... ... ...[VAR 0114(001F)]
Don’t tell me that rumor was for real! Are they\nactually gonna raid the art room?![VAR 0114(0008)]
N-no, there’s no way. They wouldn’t. We should\njust keep watching...[VAR 0114(0008)]
So, um, did...did you need anything?
Um, yeah. I, uh...I’m here to ask...you know...if...[VAR 0114(001F)]
If...?
IF YOU GOT ANY LAST WORDS, PUNK![VAR 0114(001F)]
No WAY! It’s a raid! This is literally a RAID![VAR 0114(0008)]
Oh, knock it off, Mellie![VAR 0114(0022)]
Being shy is one thing, but you can’t go around\nthreatening people to cover it up![VAR 0114(0022)]
R-right, sorry, Eri. My bad...[VAR 0114(001F)]
So, uh...about your club. The art club, I mean.\nI, um...I was wondering if...I...could join...[VAR 0114(001F)]
Oh! You wanted to ask about club membership!\nSheesh, you had me scared there!
We’re open to any students who want to join.\nBut, uhhh...
Yes! Isn’t that great, Mellie?[VAR 0114(0022)]
Hang on, Eri. This guy’s still got somethin’ to say.\c\nSpit it out, then. I gotta earn my way in or what?[VAR 0114(001F)]
Ah, no, it’s just— I was hoping I could ask what\nprompted you to go for the art club, that’s all.
You’re askin’ me why I wanna join? Well, if I\ngotta explain...[VAR 0114(001F)]
One of my pals made this outfit for me.\nThese sick boots and everythin’.[VAR 0114(001F)]
I’m big into flame patterns like this, so...I wanna\ntry and make somethin’ like it myself.[VAR 0114(001F)]
So. Yeah. PAINTING! That’s what I wanna do![VAR 0114(001F)]
I’m a total newbie at it, but...[VAR 0114(001F)]
I realized somethin’ when I saw that real simple-\nlookin’ Fletchling painting on the wall there.\c\nI don’t hafta be some genius artist. I just wanna\nmake art that has its own charm, y’know?[VAR 0114(001F)]
The Fletchling painting? Um...I did that one.
That one’s YOURS?! I thought it was, like, a\nfinger painting by a kindergartener or something![VAR 0114(001F)]
Ha ha! Yeah, I get that all the time.
Our president’s paintings are real lovable ’cause\nthey’re real simple! Everyone says so!
HUH? You’re the art club’s PRESIDENT?[VAR 0114(001F)]
I can already tell we’ll have a lot of fun in the\nclub together! Could you tell us your name?
Your boots are awesome! Can I get a closer look?
Th-the name’s Mela... And yeah, good eye!\nMy boots are the best. A pal of mine who’s a\r\nbig arts-and-crafts nerd made them for me.[VAR 0114(001F)]
So the raid thing was just a misunderstanding...\c\nWell, that’s a relief. But wow...I didn’t know that\nMellie wanted to join the art club.[VAR 0114(0008)]
I can’t wait to see what Mellie paints! I bet it’ll be\nsomething amazing, huh?[VAR 0114(0022)]
Yeah, I guess...[VAR 0114(0008)]
GAH! Eri?! How’d you know we were here?![VAR 0114(0008)]
Wait, were you supposed to be hiding?\c\nI was wondering what was going on—you were\njust kinda hanging out in the open over here...[VAR 0114(0022)]
But you don’t need to worry anyway. Mellie’s\nbeen too nervous to notice you.[VAR 0114(0022)]
Wow. So even Mellie gets the jitters sometimes.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Trying new things is scary for everyone.\nThat’s why I came with her for moral support.\r\nBut you know? I think she’ll be just fine.[VAR 0114(0022)]
And she’s not the only one doing something new!\nCarmen and I have started up a wrestling club.[VAR 0114(0022)]
Mellie will have a blast here, I’m sure, so I gotta\nkeep up with her! I’ll enjoy the time I have left at\r\nthe academy as much as I can![VAR 0114(0022)]
Anyway, it was nice bumping into you both!\nHasta la vistar! ☆[VAR 0114(0022)]
... ... ...[VAR 0114(0008)]
Mellie and Eri really are putting themselves out\nthere, aren’t they.[VAR 0114(0008)]
I...I guess I’ll head off, too. Hasta la vistar... ☆[VAR 0114(0008)]

Oh! Hey, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0008)]
Welcome to my classroom. All the students here\nare in the STEM track, just like me.[VAR 0114(0008)]
So, uh...there’s something I wanna talk to\nyou about.[VAR 0114(0008)]
But not here. Let’s go somewhere we can talk\nin private.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Th-this is my room. Make yourself at home.[VAR 0114(0008)]
It’s nice and cozy in here
A little crowded, isn’t it?
Hehe. I know, right? Being surrounded by my\nVeevees and figurines is my kinda heaven![VAR 0114(0008)]
Wait, seriously? Is it the boxes from all my online\norders? Maybe I oughta get rid of ’em, huh...[VAR 0114(0008)]
Anyway, you must be wondering why I brought\nyou here. It’s about my Team Star friends.[VAR 0114(0008)]
They...they really mean the world to me. I love\nthem all so much that I got scared they weren’t\r\ngonna fit in OK or be happy at school.[VAR 0114(0008)]
That’s why I’ve been sorta spying on them since\nthey came back.[VAR 0114(0008)]
But it turns out I didn’t need to worry.\nThey’re already having a great time![VAR 0114(0008)]
And now I feel bad that I didn’t have it in me to\nbelieve in them in the first place...[VAR 0114(0008)]
They’ve all grown so much, but I haven’t changed\nsince Operation Starfall.\c\nI’m still scheming up ways to fix things by myself\ninstead of having a little faith.[VAR 0114(0008)]
It’s only natural you’d worry
You just need to believe in them!
Y-you really think so? That’s a normal thing for\nfriends to do?[VAR 0114(0008)]
Y-yeah. I know. I promise I’ll try, but it might take\nme a little while to get there.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Huh... I feel better after talking it out with you,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]. Thanks.[VAR 0114(0008)]
And, um, I want you to know you’re a really\nimportant friend to me, too.[VAR 0114(0008)]
That goes for Nemona as well! And even Arven\nand Koraidon![VAR 0114(0008)]
That goes for Nemona as well! And even Arven\nand Miraidon![VAR 0114(0008)]
You know, I don’t normally like having people in\nmy room.[VAR 0114(0008)]
But you’re an exception. Stop by for a chat\nor whatever anytime![VAR 0114(0008)]
Till our next confab, then! Hasta la vistar! ☆[VAR 0114(0008)]

Great timing! I’ve been having the hardest time\nlining up opponents to battle![VAR 0114(0004)]
But now I found you—in the schoolyard, no less!\nIt’d be silly NOT to battle! Whaddya say?[VAR 0114(0004)]
Sure!
Well...
I knew I could count on you![VAR 0114(0004)]
Pfft, haha! You kidder, pretending like you’re not\nitching to battle! C’mon, let’s get down to it.[VAR 0114(0004)]
You spent two whole hours battling Pokémon\nwith Nemona!
Ahhh, good stuff![VAR 0114(0004)]
Gotta step up my game so I’ll be ready anytime\nfor that Academy Ace Tournament![VAR 0114(0004)]

Yep, that’s me![VAR 0114(0004)]
Ah hah hah...hah. Yeeeah. Maybe some\nother time.
[VAR 0100(0000)]! Hola![VAR 0114(0004)]
Who was that?
Friend of yours?
Oh, him? Dunno who he was![VAR 0114(0004)]
I was just munching my sandwich and I heard him\nbragging about his tough Pokémon, so I invited\r\nhim to battle![VAR 0114(0004)]
I wonder what Pokémon he’s gonna use?\nCan’t wait to see![VAR 0114(0004)]
Wait, I forgot to get his contact info! How are we\nsupposed to plan when we’ll face off?[VAR 0114(0004)]
Oh well. I’ll make sure we battle next time I run\ninto him![VAR 0114(0004)]

Better stock up real good on Poké Balls while\nI’m here...[VAR 0114(0004)]
[VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0004)]
Oh my gosh, listen to this. Remember that guy\nfrom the cafeteria?[VAR 0114(0004)]
I ran into him again in the entrance hall, so I\nasked him to battle...but he said no![VAR 0114(0004)]
He was like, “What’s the point? You’re a\nChampion and a battle whiz—you’d wreck me!”[VAR 0114(0004)]
I don’t get what he meant! I mean, you can have\nfun battling even if you lose, right?[VAR 0114(0004)]
Yeah, you can
Winning’s nice, though...
For real! I mean, sure, no one loves losing, but\nit’s definitely not pointless. It teaches you stuff![VAR 0114(0004)]
Yeeeah, I guess so... Obviously I’d rather win than\nlose, but I just think it’s better to go into things\r\nwith a “losing can be fun, too” attitude![VAR 0114(0004)]
Man... Pokémon battles can get so complicated\nsometimes.[VAR 0114(0004)]
Oh, and I wish he hadn’t called me a whiz!\nI work hard at this stuff. It’s not like it all just\r\ncomes naturally to me![VAR 0114(0004)]
Like, throwing Poké Balls obviously doesn’t come\nnaturally to me, for one thing...[VAR 0114(0004)]
I think I need a mental reset. I’m gonna go find\nsomeone to battle![VAR 0114(0004)]

And lo and behold, I was right![VAR 0114(0004)]
Well, now that I’ve found you, we should swing\nby my room and have a chat![VAR 0114(0004)]
Ta-ta-tachán! Welcome to the Zona Nemona![VAR 0114(0004)]
It’s so tidy!
It’s very you!
Aw, thank— Wait a sec... I know we’ve been to\nYOUR room before...[VAR 0114(0004)]
But have I never had you over here? Wild![VAR 0114(0004)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Anyway, uh... Listen, [VAR 0100(0000)].\nYou\r\nknow\r\nhow\r\nI, well...[VAR 0114(0004)]
You know how I really like Pokémon battles?\nLike, really, REALLY like ’em?[VAR 0114(0004)]
Yeah, you sure do
I noticed
Cool. And yeah, you know how when you really\nlike something, you dive in deep?[VAR 0114(0004)]
That’s what I did with Pokémon battles, and I...\njust kinda became a Champion?[VAR 0114(0004)]
But then I found out that’s pretty special—that\nnormally, it’s not so simple for most people.[VAR 0114(0004)]
People would tell me to my face that I’d only\nmanaged it ’cause I have some innate gift, or\r\n’cause I was raised differently, or whatever.[VAR 0114(0004)]
And suddenly I started to feel like there was this\ninvisible wall between me and everyone else.[VAR 0114(0004)]
So I started going easy when I’d battle my\nfriends. I just wanted everyone to have fun.[VAR 0114(0004)]
Oh, but don’t worry, I’m not doing that anymore!\nI’m going 100-percent all out![VAR 0114(0004)]
Especially since I’m lucky enough to have an\nopponent around who can beat me even when\r\nI’m in full hard-core mode![VAR 0114(0004)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]So just promise me one thing,\nOK, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0004)]
Promise you’ll always stay my equal! You and me,\ntrue rivals![VAR 0114(0004)]
You know it!
That’s what friends are for!
[VAR BD06(0000)]Heh heh. You’re the best,\n[VAR 0100(0000)].\r\nThank you![VAR 0114(0004)]
Oof, that got pretty personal! Little bit\nembarrassed over here...[VAR 0114(0004)]
Anyway! Since we’re equals, I gotta start having\nyou over as much as we hang out in your room![VAR 0114(0004)]
Feel free to burst on into the Zona Nemona\nwhenever you want![VAR 0114(0004)]

You’re one of the students who came here from\nthe Paldea region on a school trip![VAR 0114(002C)]
Bingo!
How’d you know?
Heh heh! It’s a small town, you know. News tends\nto spread pretty quickly![VAR 0114(002C)]
The name’s Perrin, by the way. I’m a traveler with\na bit of a thing for photography.[VAR 0114(0046)]
This here’s my bud, Growlithe. Doesn’t the little\nhorn on its head make it the cutest?[VAR 0114(0046)]
Grawa!
Hey, this might sound a bit weird, but would it\nbe all right if I took your photo?[VAR 0114(0046)]
Just like that, huh? Are you always this open with\ntotal strangers? Kinda worried about you, kiddo![VAR 0114(0046)]
Anyway, let me snap that photo.[VAR 0114(0046)]
So you know better than to put too much trust\nin a stranger you just met!\c\nGlad to see you’ve got a good head on those\nshoulders, kiddo![VAR 0114(0046)]
You’ve got a unique vibe, you know. I like it.\nIt’s a bit different than what I’m used to.[VAR 0114(0046)]
I’m gonna be making this town my home base for\na little while.[VAR 0114(0046)]
Why don’t you focus on wrapping up whatever\nyou’ve got going on for now?\c\nCome see me after, I dunno, registering 150\nPokémon in the Kitakami Pokédex or something![VAR 0114(0046)]
Kiddo. Look, I like your gung-ho style, but it\nseems to me like you’ve already got something\r\nyou need to do, don’t you?\c\nGo and catch 150 Pokémon for the Kitakami\nPokédex or something, like a good little student!\c\nCome gimme a holler AFTER you’ve done that—\nnot before.\c\nTime is money! Don’t go wasting it![VAR 0114(0046)]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Text File : s1_side02_0010
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Oh! Hey, kiddo! Wait, don’t tell me—[VAR 0114(0046)]
You actually caught over 150 Pokémon from the\nKitakami Pokédex?!\c\nNow I KNOW you’re the real deal![VAR 0114(0046)]
That’s right!
It’s not that much...
Pretty impressive! You must really be something\nspecial, kiddo![VAR 0114(0046)]
Hahaha! No need to act modest, kiddo! You\nshould be proud![VAR 0114(0046)]
You probably know more about the Pokémon\nhere in Kitakami than I do—and I got here first![VAR 0114(0046)]
Which reminds me![VAR 0114(0046)]
I’ve got a favor to ask you, see. A real Pokémon-\ncatching pro like you is just what I need.[VAR 0114(0046)]
What kind of favor?
Not interested...
Ooh, did I tickle your curiosity? Glad you don’t\nseem afraid to poke your head into new things!\r\nIn that case, let me tell you what I’m all about.[VAR 0114(0046)]
Kiddo! Come ON! It’s important to take detours\nin life sometimes, don’t you know that?\c\nSo yeah, I’m just gonna tell you anyway.[VAR 0114(0046)]
The reason I came here to Kitakami was actually\nto find a certain Pokémon...and photograph it.[VAR 0114(0046)]
I’ve been searching on my own for ages, but I\nstill haven’t found it![VAR 0114(0046)]
So, kiddo...how about doing me a solid by\nhelping me with my search? I’d owe you forever![VAR 0114(0046)]
Rumor has it that the Pokémon I’m looking for\nis pretty ferociously strong.[VAR 0114(0046)]
Just think! You could catch it and bring it along\non your adventures! Wouldn’t that be helpful?[VAR 0114(0046)]
That enough to pique your interest? If so, I’ll\nneed you to prove you’re strong enough to help.[VAR 0114(0046)]
If we’re really gonna partner up on this thing,\nthen I want to know you’re cut out for it.\c\nThat, and I want to get a good shot of you\nlooking all heroic and everything.[VAR 0114(0046)]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Text File : s1_side02_0020
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
OK, kiddo! Time for me to take a perfect shot—\nat your confidence, that is!\c\nReady to show me what you’ve got?[VAR 0114(0046)]
Really? How about just a photo shoot, then?[VAR 0114(0046)]
Yes! Then let’s just put a bit of distance between\nus—enough to keep my shots in focus...[VAR 0114(0046)]
I’m not so strong, but don’t hold back! And don’t\nmind me snapping a few shots while we’re at it![VAR 0114(0046)]
You’re something, all right. I got a buncha good\nshots of you in action, too.[VAR 0114(0046)]
I think you just might have what it takes to hold\nyour own against the [VAR FF00(0006)]Bloodmoon Beast[VAR FF00(0000)].[VAR 0114(0046)]
The Bloodmoon Beast?
Is that the Pokémon you’re after?
Yeah. There’s a certain Ursaluna I’ve been\nsearching for...\c\nIt’s known as the Bloodmoon Beast.[VAR 0114(0046)]
Have you ever heard of Ursaluna? Word is they\nweren’t all that uncommon a long, long time ago.[VAR 0114(0046)]
See, Ursaluna is a Pokémon that usually has this\nbig yellow mark on its forehead resembling a full\r\nmoon—but they say this one’s mark is red...[VAR 0114(0046)]
A red moon, as if seen through a veil of blood...\c\nThat’s why they call it the Bloodmoon Beast.[VAR 0114(0046)]
This Ursaluna—the Bloodmoon Beast—used to\nlive in my homeland waaay back when people\r\nstill called the region Hisui.[VAR 0114(0046)]
Seems like it crossed over the waters here to\nKitakami at some point and made itself comfy.[VAR 0114(0046)]
If the two of us work together, I bet we could be\nthe ones to finally find and snap a shot of it.\r\nAnd if we do...[VAR 0114(0046)]
Kiddo!\c\nNo, not “kiddo”—partner![VAR 0114(0046)]
Let’s tackle this together, so we can find the\nBloodmoon Beast for sure![VAR 0114(0046)]
Let’s do it!
I don’t know...
I knew you’d be up for it! And don’t worry—I’ll\nbe sure to reward your hard work.[VAR 0114(0046)]
Aw, don’t be like that! I’ll even reward you for\nthe effort you put in![VAR 0114(0046)]
Word has it the Bloodmoon Beast has been seen\nin an area northeast of Oni Mountain called the\r\n[VAR FF00(0006)]Timeless Woods[VAR FF00(0000)]![VAR 0114(0046)]
I’ll head that way now and wait for you there![VAR 0114(0046)]
Come on, Growlithe![VAR 0114(0046)]
Grawaaan!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Text File : s1_side02_0030
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Good... Yeah, just like that![VAR 0114(0046)]
OK, now give me...cute![VAR 0114(0046)]
Call out to her
Keep watching
Yes, look at you, you clever thing! Lovely![VAR 0114(0046)]
Now hold that pose for just a sec... Yes! That’s\nmy little cutie pie![VAR 0114(0046)]
Wow, look at you! I didn’t even know you could\npull off that kind of expression! So photogenic![VAR 0114(0046)]
You’re just too adorable, you know that?! I could\neat you right up![VAR 0114(0046)]
What’s this?! An extra serving of cuteness, just for\nme?! Don’t mind if I do![VAR 0114(0046)]
More! I need more! Someone get me some extra\nstorage—and a napkin, too![VAR 0114(0046)]
Growawan!
Oh! Hey, partner! You made it![VAR 0114(0046)]
How long have you been standing there? You\nweren’t, uh, listening in on all that stuff I—\r\nNope! Don’t want to know! Forget I asked![VAR 0114(0046)]
I can’t help myself when I see adorable Pokémon\nlike that—I just had to snap a couple shots![VAR 0114(0046)]
Aaanyway, it’s right around this part of the\nforest where people have supposedly seen\r\nthe Bloodmoon Beast.[VAR 0114(0046)]
Curiously, all the sightings have been on [VAR FF00(0006)]nights[VAR FF00(0000)]\n[VAR FF00(0006)]with heavy fog[VAR FF00(0000)].[VAR 0114(0046)]
In fact, I’ve heard that all kinds of unusual\nPokémon appear on foggy nights.\c\nI’m sure that the Bloodmoon Beast is one of\nthem—it’s gotta be...[VAR 0114(0046)]
*rustle rustle rustle*
Oh, is that my little cutie pie, back for another\nphoto shoot?[VAR 0114(0046)]
Shaaa!
Gyah?![VAR 0114(0046)]
Ow-ow-ow...[VAR 0114(0046)]
Grrr-ow-ow!
Better lend a hand!
Better protect Growlithe!
Kiii-kiii-kiii!
Owww... That really surprised me.[VAR 0114(0046)]
My camera’s OK, though. Thanks, partner.[VAR 0114(0046)]
Bow-ow!
And thanks to you too, of course.[VAR 0114(0046)]
I feel a bit bad for that Ariados. It probably\nwasn’t expecting to see humans out here.\r\nI bet it only attacked because it was surprised.[VAR 0114(0046)]
We should set up a tent! That’ll let the Pokémon\nknow we’re here and help them get used to us![VAR 0114(0046)]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Text File : s1_side02_0035
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
She may be old, but she’s still a fine tent, eh![VAR 0114(0046)]
It’s actually my dad’s, but he wasn’t using it, so I\njust helped myself to it.[VAR 0114(0046)]
Say hello to our new base of operations for our\nsurvey of the Bloodmoon Beast![VAR 0114(0046)]
Wow-ow!
Now, the Bloodmoon Beast is way more wary\nthan an ordinary Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0046)]
That’s why there have been so few sightings—or\nso they say.[VAR 0114(0046)]
That means we’re going to need to do some slow\nand steady groundwork if we wanna find it![VAR 0114(0046)]
So, partner, what I’m going to need your help\nwith most...is [VAR FF00(0006)]photographing Pokémon[VAR FF00(0000)]![VAR 0114(0046)]
I want you to take photos of the Pokémon that\nappear around here on foggy nights.[VAR 0114(0046)]
I’m looking for lots of pictures of a good variety\nof Pokémon![VAR 0114(0046)]
Afterward, I’ll register your photo data into my\nhandy Pokémon Searcher![VAR 0114(0046)]
Over time, that’ll train it to ignore any sign of\nother Pokémon that live around here.\c\nClearing all that noise will let us pinpoint\nexactly where the Bloodmoon Beast is![VAR 0114(0046)]
Brilliant!
I don’t get it!
Whoa, you actually understood that?![VAR 0114(0046)]
I was just rattling off what the manual said.\c\nI picked this thing up at a thrift shop. I don’t\nreally understand how it’s supposed to work.[VAR 0114(0046)]
Right! Who would![VAR 0114(0046)]
To be honest, I’ve got no idea how it’s supposed\nto work either.\c\nI just picked this thing up at a thrift shop, and\nthat’s what it says to do in the manual.\c\nI’m sure it’ll be fine, right?[VAR 0114(0046)]
My preliminary surveys make me think there are\nactually dozens of Pokémon species that tend to\r\nshow up around the forest on foggy nights.[VAR 0114(0046)]
We can split the load, so how about you try and\nsnap photos of [VAR FF00(0006)]10 species [VAR FF00(0000)]of Pokémon for me?[VAR 0114(0046)]
How ’bout it, partner? If we tackle this together,\nI’m sure we’ll find the Bloodmoon Beast![VAR 0114(0046)]
Oh, and we’re looking for clear photos that get\nthe Pokémon nice and big in the frame!\c\nYou’ll want to sneak up on foot to get close to\nthem—no riding on big, noisy Pokémon![VAR 0114(0046)]
Think you’re ready? Just say the word!\c\nOnce you’re good, we can set up in the tent\nand wait for a [VAR FF00(0006)]foggy night[VAR FF00(0000)].[VAR 0114(0046)]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Text File : s1_side02_0040
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
OK, so if we just compile the photos we both\ntook...[VAR 0114(0046)]
It looks like we’ve photographed every Pokémon\nknown to appear in the forest when it’s foggy![VAR 0114(0046)]
We did it! We really pulled it off! I can’t tell you\nhow much I appreciate this![VAR 0114(0046)]
Grawa!
Now we just send all our data to the Pokémon\nSearcher, and...[VAR 0114(0046)]
wait, I guess. It’s supposed to take a little bit for\nall the data to be, uh, processed. Or whatever.[VAR 0114(0046)]
You know, the photos you took were all real\ngood, partner. You’ve got an eye for this![VAR 0114(0046)]
So, spill: What were you thinking about most\nwhen you were taking those photos?[VAR 0114(0046)]
Capturing the Pokémon as they are
Showing off the Pokémon’s best sides
I wasn’t really thinking about anything...
Trying to capture the Pokémon as they are...\c\nSo you really wanted to show how the Pokémon\nlive, pure and unadulterated, huh?[VAR 0114(0046)]
Trying to show off the Pokémon’s best sides...\c\nSo you try to capture those moments when your\nsubject is really shining their brightest, huh?[VAR 0114(0046)]
You weren’t thinking about anything, huh?\c\nI guess you were just capturing the world around\nyou with the natural instincts of a born artist.[VAR 0114(0046)]
I, uh...I’m actually in a bit of slump myself.[VAR 0114(0046)]
Even a kid like you knows what a slump is, right?\nLike, when nothing seems to go right for you.[VAR 0114(0046)]
You might not believe it, but when I was younger,\nI was lauded as a photography prodigy...\r\nEveryone loved my photos! Absolutely everyone![VAR 0114(0046)]
But in these past few years, I feel like I’ve lost my\nspark—and my photos show it. They lack heart.\r\nThe awards have all dried up. The accolades too.[VAR 0114(0046)]
And the longer it keeps dragging on...[VAR 0114(0046)]
the more I lose sight of what it is I even want to\ncapture with my photos.[VAR 0114(0046)]
Grawww...?
That’s when I heard the stories about the\nBloodmoon Beast.[VAR 0114(0046)]
I left for Kitakami as fast as I could—I thought\nthat if I could just get a photo of an astounding\r\nPokémon like that, then maybe, just maybe...\r\nsomething inside me would change.[VAR 0114(0046)]
It’ll be OK!
That’s rough...
Thanks, partner. And sorry. I didn’t mean to bring\nthe whole mood down with my problems.[VAR 0114(0046)]
“That’s rough”? Hahaha! That’s all you’ve got?\nYou’re not very good at this comfort thing, kid.\r\nHahahaha, oh man, that killed me...[VAR 0114(0046)]
*dingle-dee-dee-dootle*
Oh, I guess the machine’s done doing its thing.\nBut...that jingle...[VAR 0114(0046)]
I’m pretty sure that’s the same one my dryer\nplays when it’s done with a load...[VAR 0114(0046)]
Hahaha, too funny! Who decided to use that?\nCan you just give anything a jingle now?[VAR 0114(0046)]
Anyway, if we filter out all of our data...\c\nIt looks like there’s still one hit out there in the\nfoggy woods.[VAR 0114(0046)]
That’s gotta be the Bloodmoon Beast. We’ve\nfinally found it...[VAR 0114(0046)]
Heh. This is it! You know, talking to you really\nhelped me throw off some of that old tension.[VAR 0114(0046)]
I think I’m ready to go meet the Bloodmoon\nBeast! How about you, partner? You ready?[VAR 0114(0046)]
Yes! Then we’re off![VAR 0114(0046)]
Looks like your Pokémon Boxes might be full\nthere, partner.\c\nYou might want to keep some space open, just\nin case, right?[VAR 0114(0046)]
Let me know as soon as you’re ready to go meet\nthe Bloodmoon Beast for yourself, then![VAR 0114(0046)]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Text File : s1_side02_0050
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You all ready to meet the Bloodmoon Beast?[VAR 0114(0046)]
It’s supposed to be a fearsome creature...\c\nIn this case, there’s no such thing as being\noverprepared![VAR 0114(0046)]
Great! Now we just need some fog. Come on, we\ncan relax in the tent till it rolls in.[VAR 0114(0046)]
The fog is pretty dense.[VAR 0114(0046)]
It’s finally time for me to capture the Bloodmoon\nBeast...on film, that is![VAR 0114(0046)]
If things start to look dicey, I’ll be counting on\nyou to handle the battling, partner.[VAR 0114(0046)]
Grrr-waw!
You too, of course, Growlithe![VAR 0114(0046)]
Now then, let’s get going![VAR 0114(0046)]
That hit we got on the Pokémon Searcher came\nfrom somewhere around here...[VAR 0114(0046)]
It’s...awfully quiet.[VAR 0114(0046)]
Let’s stay alert
Don’t let your guard down
Got it.[VAR 0114(0046)]
*STOMP* *STOMP*
Are those footsteps? Whatever’s making them\nmust be huge...[VAR 0114(0046)]
*rustle rustle rustle*
Wa-gaaaaaahhh!!
It’s got a red moon on its forehead![VAR 0114(0046)]
It’s the Bloodmoon Beast! It’s...it’s real!\nWe actually found it![VAR 0114(0046)]
Wa?
Gra-wa?
R-right! My camera![VAR 0114(0046)]
Now, you just be a good little beast and stay\nright there while I snap a photo...[VAR 0114(0046)]
[~ 54]
Wah?!
S-sorry! The auto flash just—[VAR 0114(0046)]
GRRRAAAHHH!
G-Growlithe, you ready?![VAR 0114(0046)]
Wo...
Sounds like that’s a no![VAR 0114(0046)]
How about you, partner?![VAR 0114(0046)]
I’ve got it covered!
Over here, big guy!
Sorry—and thanks! You’ve got this![VAR 0114(0046)]
[~ 54]
You OK, partner?![VAR 0114(0046)]
I didn’t seriously think you’d go toe-to-toe with\nthe Bloodmoon Beast, let alone catch it![VAR 0114(0046)]
That was amazing... Absolutely amazing![VAR 0114(0046)]
Grow-wow!
Growlithe...[VAR 0114(0046)]
You’ve got to work on those nerves a bit, bud.[VAR 0114(0046)]
Bowww...
Hah. But my heart is still beating a mile a minute!\nWhat a thrill![VAR 0114(0046)]
I just couldn’t stop snapping shots of you battling\nthe Bloodmoon Beast![VAR 0114(0046)]
I bet you want to give your Pokémon a chance to\nrest and recover though, huh, partner?\r\nLet’s head back to camp for now.[VAR 0114(0046)]
Packing up the ol’ tent and calling it a day feels\na bit sad...like the end of an adventure.[VAR 0114(0046)]
I couldn’t have done this without you, partner.[VAR 0114(0046)]
Because of you, I finally feel like I have some\nphotos here that I want to keep forever...[VAR 0114(0046)]
It’s been ages since I’ve felt this way. Seriously.[VAR 0114(0046)]
And now that I’m all motivated, it’s time to ride\nthis feeling and seize the day!\c\nI’m heading back to the village this instant to get\nthese photos developed![VAR 0114(0046)]
As we always say in my family: “Time wasted is\nlost!” So I’m not wasting any more time![VAR 0114(0046)]
Let’s meet again in Mossui![VAR 0114(0046)]
Grawaaan!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Text File : s1_side02_0060
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Hey, partner! Looks like you’re full up on\nPokémon, huh? No room in your party or Boxes!\c\nLook, I’m trying to keep it a surprise here, but\ntrust me when I say you’ll want to make some\r\nroom in your Boxes, then come talk to me again![VAR 0114(0046)]
I’ve been waiting for you to come by, partner![VAR 0114(0046)]
I managed to develop the photos I took of the\nBloodmoon Beast![VAR 0114(0046)]
Show me!
How do they look?
Oh, well, fact is that once I got them all printed\nout, I could see that the photos I managed to get\r\nare all blurry or cut off or out of focus...[VAR 0114(0046)]
They really aren’t good enough to show anyone—\nnot even you, partner.[VAR 0114(0046)]
But still...\c\nOut of all the photos I’ve ever taken, I think they\nmay be my favorites.[VAR 0114(0046)]
I think I’d gotten too caught up in my own head.\nWorrying about framing or what judges might say,\r\nalways thinking about what I ought to capture...[VAR 0114(0046)]
But just capturing your subjects as they are—\nthat’s what photos should be![VAR 0114(0046)]
You taught me something important, partner.\nSo...thanks for that.[VAR 0114(0046)]
Ah! That’s right! Your name! I never even asked\nyou your name, partner![VAR 0114(0046)]
I know that’s awful of me, after all you did to\nhelp, but...mind teaching me your name?[VAR 0114(0046)]
You can call me [VAR 0100(0000)]!
...My name is [VAR 0100(0000)].
[VAR BD06(0000)][VAR 0100(0000)]! A perfect name for a\ngutsy\r\nkid\r\nlike you![VAR 0114(0046)]
[VAR BD06(0000)][VAR 0100(0000)]! But what’s with\nthat\r\ndark\r\nlook?\r\nDon’t\r\nwant\r\nme\r\nto\r\nknow\r\nyour\r\nname\r\nor\r\nsomething?[VAR 0114(0046)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Well then! Nice to officially meet you,\n[VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0046)]
The name’s Perrin. A photographer with a\nrenewed love of photography![VAR 0114(0046)]
I can say that with pride now![VAR 0114(0046)]
AH! And your reward![VAR 0114(0046)]
You’ve earned yourself a real choice reward for\nall the help you’ve been![VAR 0114(0046)]
Oh, and this Growlithe of mine has a younger\nbrother that really loves battling...[VAR 0114(0046)]
I think you’ll do a better job of raising it good\nand strong.[VAR 0114(0046)]
You received a Growlithe from Perrin!
Raise it to be reeeaaal strong, OK?[VAR 0114(0046)]
I think that about wraps it up. I did what I came\nhere to do, so I guess I should hit the road.[VAR 0114(0046)]
I’m afraid this is good-bye.[VAR 0114(0046)]
But you know, Growlithe like these are known for\nliving and working together in pairs.[VAR 0114(0046)]
Even if they are separated for a while, I bet\ntheir paths might just cross again someday...\r\nso you raise that one with care in the meantime![VAR 0114(0046)]
We’ll definitely meet again!
I’ll raise this Growlithe to be strong!
Yeah! I’m looking forward to seeing what you\npull off. I’ve got high hopes![VAR 0114(0046)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]So bye for now, [VAR 0100(0000)].\nUntil\r\nnext\r\ntime![VAR 0114(0046)]
Bow-wooow!

There’s a dusty old decoration of some sort\nmixed in with all the daily goods and things...\r\nand it smells incredibly sweet!
The decoration appeared to...move a little bit?
Ro-to-to-to-to... ♪
[VAR 0100(0000)]! Yo! Arven here![VAR 0114(0006)]
I heard the news. You’ve been having all kinds\nof big adventures, huh, little buddy?\r\nSchool trips, studying abroad... What luck![VAR 0114(0006)]
Yeah, it’s been awesome!
Oh, it’s not that big of a deal...
Yeah? Man, I’m jealous to hear that. I wish I\ncould’ve gone along too![VAR 0114(0006)]
Are you kidding me?! Man, acting like this kinda\nthing’s normal. What a world traveler![VAR 0114(0006)]
Now that I think about it, it’s been one crazy\nthing after another since you came to our school.[VAR 0114(0006)]
I guess you’ve still been real busy lately, but are\nthings starting to settle down?[VAR 0114(0006)]
I was thinking that if you have time—and only\nif you want, ’course—maybe...[VAR 0114(0006)]
I could come visit you at your house?[VAR 0114(0006)]
Of course! Come right over!
Is something wrong?
Seriously?! It’s such a relief to hear you say that!\nAnd without even the tiniest hesitation![VAR 0114(0006)]
Nah, nothing like that! I just thought, you know,\nfriends...go to each other’s houses and stuff?[VAR 0114(0006)]
So I guess I’ll come over![VAR 0114(0006)]

[VAR BD06(0000)][VAR 0100(0000)], I... This is all my\nfault!\r\nSorry![VAR 0114(0006)]
You know when I called you and said I wanted to\ncome hang? Well, these two overheard, and—[VAR 0114(0006)]
Well, we weren’t just going to let you hog the\nchance to visit [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0008)]
It’s way more fun to roll together![VAR 0114(0004)]
You say that, but who wants a buncha uninvited\nguests?! That’s just rude![VAR 0114(0006)]
It’s totally fine!
Don’t worry about it!
[VAR BD06(0000)]I guess...if you’re fine with it,\n[VAR 0100(0000)],\r\nthen\r\nI\r\ncan’t\r\nreally\r\ncomplain,\r\neither...[VAR 0114(0006)]
OK, listen up, you two![VAR 0114(0006)]
We’re not allowed to cause any trouble for\n[VAR 0100(0000)] and h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]iser mom! Got it?!\c\nWe’re gonna be the perfect guests today![VAR 0114(0006)]
You bet![VAR 0114(0004)]
I don’t know who you think you’re educating\nhere, but sure. Whatever.[VAR 0114(0008)]

That was such a great meal. Can’t believe we\ngot all that after we barged in outta nowhere![VAR 0114(0004)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Your mom’s cooking is so good,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0006)]
Right? And she’s so pretty, my brain literally\nglitched when I saw her.[VAR 0114(0008)]
I’m so glad she remembered me![VAR 0114(0004)]
And look at this huge room! Doesn’t make you\nfeel all boxed in like the dorm rooms do.[VAR 0114(0006)]
It’s super cute, seriously... Almost too much for\nme to take![VAR 0114(0006)]
Oooh, it’s a Nintendo Switch! You HAVE to tell\nme what games you’ve got on this thing![VAR 0114(0008)]
I love this Skwovet plush! This fluff’s to die for![VAR 0114(0004)]
How’s everybody doing? Anyone want dessert?\nI was thinking of bringing up some sweets...[VAR 0114(002B)]
Sweets?! Yesss![VAR 0114(0008)]
N-n-no way! We couldn’t possibly ask you for\nmore food! We don’t mean to be a hustle!\r\nHassle, I mean! We don’t want to be a hassle![VAR 0114(0006)]
Hehe! Oh, sweetie, no need to stand on\nceremony here![VAR 0114(002B)]
Just make yourselves at home and relax![VAR 0114(002B)]
Y-yes, ma’am![VAR 0114(0006)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Oh, and [VAR 0100(0000)]—a letter came\nfor\r\nyou.[VAR 0114(002B)]
It’s from...“Kieran.” Do you know a Kieran?[VAR 0114(002B)]
My word, you’ve been making plenty of friends![VAR 0114(002B)]
Really? Well, that’s odd... Still, it WAS addressed\nto you, so I suppose I shouldn’t read it.[VAR 0114(002B)]
Here you are.[VAR 0114(002B)]
I’ll bring those sweets up in just a few. I hope\nyou’ll all enjoy them![VAR 0114(002B)]
I’ll come help![VAR 0114(0004)]
Gah, I wanna check out the sweets, too![VAR 0114(0008)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Your mom sure is nice,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]...\r\nYou’re\r\nreal\r\nlucky...[VAR 0114(0006)]
Oh, but what about that letter? Aren’t you gonna\nat least open it up?[VAR 0114(0006)]
Dear [VAR 0100(0000)],\n\nHow are you doing lately? I took a leave from\nschool, so I’m back in Mossui Town for a while.\nMy sis came back with me, too.
I know we didn’t get much chance to talk after\neverything that happened in the underdepths. I’d\nreally like to catch up. Think you could swing a\nvisit to Kitakami? Carmine would love to see you,\nI’m sure—maybe you could bring your friends\nfrom Paldea, too. I included plenty of tickets.
Who’s this Kieran guy? Some new...friend or\nsomething?[VAR 0114(0006)]
Yeah, just a friend
Yeah, he’s...a friend
Yeah? I mean...guess that’s good for you and all.[VAR 0114(0006)]
What’s with the weird hesitation? There some\nkind of story there? Not that it’s my business...[VAR 0114(0006)]
[VAR BD06(0000)][VAR 0100(0000)]! Arven! You are not gonna\nBELIEVE\r\nhow\r\ngood\r\nthis\r\nstuff looks![VAR 0114(0004)]
There’s too much to carry upstairs! C’mon down\nhere and eat![VAR 0114(0004)]
Sheesh, that Nemona... Hasn’t she ever heard of\nan inside voice?[VAR 0114(0006)]
But I guess we’d better go, or she’ll just keep on\nshouting![VAR 0114(0006)]
Oooh, my poor gut... I feel like I’ll burst if I eat\nanother bite...[VAR 0114(0008)]
I think what you’re trying to say is “Thank you so\nmuch for feeding us. It was all really delicious!”\c\nRight?![VAR 0114(0006)]
I’ll help with the dishes and stuff![VAR 0114(0004)]
Oh, aren’t you the sweetest thing! But no need\nto lift a finger. You kids just take it easy.[VAR 0114(002B)]
Thanks, ma’am! You’re the best![VAR 0114(0004)]
At least Nemona’s got manners, I’ll give her that.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Unlike this one...[VAR 0114(0006)]
Huh? Why’re you looking at me?[VAR 0114(0008)]
Say, [VAR 0100(0000)], about that letter...[VAR 0114(0006)]
What was that place your new pal mentioned?\nKitakami or something?[VAR 0114(0006)]
You really gonna go there to meet this Kieran\nguy again?[VAR 0114(0006)]
Yeah, let’s all go!
We should go together!
Wait, what? You going somewhere?[VAR 0114(0008)]
Oh. Uhhh...[VAR 0114(0006)]
Did we miss something? Something good?!\nSpill it![VAR 0114(0004)]
Are you serious?! We’re DEFINITELY going\nwith you![VAR 0114(0004)]
This Kieran kid was Champion of a super elite\nbattle academy, right?! I’ve got to meet him![VAR 0114(0004)]
More like “I’ve got to BATTLE him”...[VAR 0114(0008)]
Was it that obvious?[VAR 0114(0004)]
I feel kinda bad, though. Like we just invited\nourselves along on your trip without asking...[VAR 0114(0006)]
The guy said to bring friends, and WE’RE\nthose friends! He even sent tickets for us![VAR 0114(0004)]
Yup. “Friends” equals us. Ergo, we get the tickets.[VAR 0114(0008)]
You bet we do![VAR 0114(0004)]
This’ll be my first time going on a trip with\nfriends...[VAR 0114(0008)]
It’s kind of...scary and exciting at the same time.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Yeah, now that you mention it, I don’t think\nI’ve ever taken a trip with a friend either.[VAR 0114(0006)]
You’re kidding! Well, this is gonna be AMAZING,\nso get excited![VAR 0114(0004)]
Guess I better at least tell the housekeeper\nover at my place I’ll be away for a while.[VAR 0114(0004)]
Why don’t we break for now, do whatever\nprep we gotta do, and meet up again later?[VAR 0114(0004)]
Sounds good! Let’s say...we meet up again in\nfront of [VAR FF00(0006)]Mesagoza’s southern gate[VAR FF00(0000)]![VAR 0114(0006)]
Roger. See you all later, then![VAR 0114(0008)]
Thanks for having us over![VAR 0114(004C)]
Oh, did Nemona and the others leave already?[VAR 0114(002B)]
Your friends are all such nice kids. I was really\nglad to meet them all.[VAR 0114(002B)]
And now it sounds like you’re all about to go\nhave a little adventure together, hm?[VAR 0114(002B)]
Well, have fun if you do! No fighting, and be\nsure to look after one another![VAR 0114(002B)]

Hey! Over here! Over heeeeeere![VAR 0114(0006)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]All right, [VAR 0100(0000)]. Didja load\nup\r\non\r\ntravel\r\nsnacks?\r\nYour\r\nBag\r\nfull\r\nof grub?[VAR 0114(0004)]
Oh my GOSH, Dad, would you just drop it?!\nI told you—friends! I’m going with friends![VAR 0114(0008)]
No, you DON’T need to be worried about it! We\nare perfectly capable of taking care of ourselves![VAR 0114(0008)]
Ughhh, no, it’s not gonna be an “Adven-tour”—\nno one says that! Honestly. I’m hanging up now![VAR 0114(0008)]
Haaah. Suddenly I’m too tired for any of this...[VAR 0114(0008)]
Did you get your old man’s OK to go?[VAR 0114(0006)]
Yeah...in the end. But I had to put up with his\nultra-mega-annoying dad talk to do it.[VAR 0114(0008)]
He just ultra-mega-cares, little bud![VAR 0114(0006)]
Oh! Oh...yeah, maybe you’re right...[VAR 0114(0008)]
OK! We’ve all got permission, and we’re all here![VAR 0114(0004)]
No one forgot anything, right? Then vamos!\nLet’s go![VAR 0114(0004)]
Let’s gooooooooo!!![VAR 0114(004C)]

Oooh, so this is Mossui Town?[VAR 0114(0004)]
You all smell that, right? It kinda smells different\nthan Paldea![VAR 0114(0004)]
Urrrgggh... My head’s still spinning too fast to\nsee anything... Are we there yet?[VAR 0114(0008)]
Maybe you wouldn’t have gotten so carsick if you\nhadn’t stared at your phone the whole bus ride.[VAR 0114(0006)]
But I didn’t know if we’d get signal here... I had\nto load up on internet goodness while I could...[VAR 0114(0008)]
Why, hello there![VAR 0114(0045)]
Hiya![VAR 0114(0004)]
Hiya, indeed. I’m the caretaker here, and it’s\na pleasure to welcome you to our town.[VAR 0114(0045)]
Kieran had mentioned you all would be coming.[VAR 0114(0045)]
[VAR BD06(0000)][VAR 0100(0000)]\naside,\r\nthis\r\nis\r\neveryone’s\r\nfirst\r\ntime\r\nvisiting\r\nKitakami,\r\nis\r\nthat\r\nright?[VAR 0114(0045)]
Yeah, that’s the long and short of it.[VAR 0114(0006)]
What’re you saying?! It really is the first time for\nthe rest of us![VAR 0114(0006)]
I see, I see. Well, again, you’re most welcome.[VAR 0114(0045)]
You can sleep here at the community center.\nAll the rooms have been freshened up for you.[VAR 0114(0045)]
Whoa... Now that’s some thoughtful service.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Hahaha! It was no trouble. Now please, relax and\nenjoy yourselves—but most of all, enjoy Kitakami![VAR 0114(0045)]
Thanks very much, sir![VAR 0114(0004)]
So what about that Kieran guy? Have you heard\nfrom him at all?[VAR 0114(0006)]
EXCUSE me? He doesn’t have a smartphone?!\nHow is this kid even alive?![VAR 0114(0008)]
He must not want any distractions from training!\nThink he’s at his house? Should we go meet him?[VAR 0114(0004)]
I’m gonna make it clear once and for all who\nyour REAL best friend is. Just you wait and see.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Reception out here really is lousy. Me and my\npoor phone don’t stand a chance...[VAR 0114(0008)]
Do you think Kieran’s at his house? I can’t wait to\nbat—uh, befriend him![VAR 0114(0004)]

Thanks so much for coming![VAR 0114(0043)]
Sorry that I couldn’t come meet you at the bus\nstop. Things have been crazy at home...[VAR 0114(0043)]
We had it all in hand!
It’s great to see you!
Ehehe... Thanks![VAR 0114(0043)]
But wait—did you come all by yourself?[VAR 0114(0043)]
Yo, we’re here too.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Hey, nice to meet you! I’m Nemona!\c\nYou’re Kieran, yeah?\c\n[VAR 0100(0000)] told us all about you!\c\nLike how you’re great at Pokémon battles!\nRight?![VAR 0114(0004)]
W-well, I don’t know about that, but...[VAR 0114(0043)]
Dial it back a notch or nine. You’re scaring him.[VAR 0114(0008)]
I’m Penny. Unlike a certain someone, I’m fine\nwith taking friendships nice and slow.[VAR 0114(0008)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]And I’m Arven. [VAR 0100(0000)]’s\nabsolute\r\nBEST\r\nfriend.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Staking your claim right from the get-go, huh?[VAR 0114(0008)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Well, I’m Kieran. I met\n[VAR 0100(0000)]\r\nwhen\r\n[VAR 1100(00FF,0100)]she\r\ncame\r\nhere\r\nfor\r\nthat\r\nschool\r\ntrip.\c\nThat’s when we became friends.[VAR 0114(0043)]
Um...what else...? Oh, I’m a student at Blueberry\nAcademy.\c\nEr, I mean, I WAS a student there—I’m on a break\nright now.[VAR 0114(0043)]
Whoa, really? I know how that goes. Same thing\nhappened to me![VAR 0114(0008)]
Penny! Don’t go sympathizing with the enemy![VAR 0114(0006)]
I thought I could count on you at least to keep\nthis interloper at arm’s length...[VAR 0114(0006)]
Eh. I just get the feeling we’re pretty alike.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Wow, your friends seem like a quirky group.\nKinda like you, huh?[VAR 0114(0043)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Anyways, a friend of [VAR 0100(0000)]’s is\na\r\nfriend\r\nof\r\nmine![VAR 0114(0043)]
I hope you all have a good time staying in\nKitakami![VAR 0114(0043)]
Thanks! Now let’s battle![VAR 0114(0004)]
I, uh...what?[VAR 0114(0043)]
That space in front of the community center\nlooked like a good battle spot![VAR 0114(0004)]
Vamos! C’mon![VAR 0114(0004)]
Does she want me to go with her? Am I supposed\nto go battle her...?[VAR 0114(0043)]
Yup, go have fun!
You’ve got this!
Aw man... She’s just as pushy as Sis is...but, like...\ndifferent.[VAR 0114(0043)]
Oh no. I...I think I might have made a terrible\nmistake.\c\nThis Kieran kid might actually be a good guy![VAR 0114(0006)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Of course he is. He’s friends with\n[VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0008)]
Y-yeah... Yeah, that’s true.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Shoot, I must’ve come across like a real jerk.\nMaybe I shoulda toned it down a bit, huh...[VAR 0114(0006)]
We introverts know how to recognize one\nanother.[VAR 0114(0008)]
You weren’t kidding. Kieran’s great! Lemme see,\nwhich Pokémon should I use for our NEXT battle?[VAR 0114(0004)]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I got completely destroyed... Who the heck IS\nNemona, anyway?[VAR 0114(0043)]
She’s a Champion!
She’s my rival!
Wait, she’s a Champion in the Paldea region?!\nOK, yeah, it makes sense she’s so good, then.[VAR 0114(0043)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]You consider her a rival,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]?!\r\nOK,\r\nyeah,\r\nit\r\nmakes\r\nsense\r\nshe’s\r\nso\r\ngood,\r\nthen.[VAR 0114(0043)]
Kieran, you’re so good! That was awesome! No\nwonder you were the Champion of that fancy-\r\npants school of yours![VAR 0114(0004)]
B-but...I couldn’t beat you...[VAR 0114(0043)]
Does it really matter? Whether you win or lose,\nPokémon battles are a blast![VAR 0114(0004)]
... ... ...[VAR 0114(0043)]
Yeah. That’s true.[VAR 0114(0043)]
That’s Nemona for you. You get used to it.[VAR 0114(0006)]
You OK? Feel like running for the hills yet?[VAR 0114(0008)]
Hey now![VAR 0114(0004)]
N-not at all! It was a lot of fun![VAR 0114(0043)]
Yeah... I really had a lotta fun![VAR 0114(0043)]
See?[VAR 0114(0004)]
... ... ...[VAR 0114(0044)]
Whoa! Who the heck are you?![VAR 0114(0006)]
Sis! You OK?[VAR 0114(0043)]
M...mo...[VAR 0114(0044)]
Mochi MOCHI!!![VAR 0114(0044)]
Carmine?!
What’s wrong?!
Mochi! Mochi! MOCHI! MOCHI!!![VAR 0114(0044)]
Is this your big sister, Kieran? Do you think she\nwants in on the battle fun too?[VAR 0114(0004)]
There’s no way that’s what’s going on here...[VAR 0114(0008)]
S-sorry, everybody, but could you help me just,\nuh...just carry my sis somewhere safe?![VAR 0114(0043)]
You want us to pick her up and drag her off?!\nI mean...if you say so...[VAR 0114(0006)]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You sure you don’t want to stay with your sister?[VAR 0114(0004)]
She should be OK... Gramps and Grandma look\nafter her during the day, but they must’ve taken\r\ntheir eyes off her for just a sec earlier...[VAR 0114(0043)]
Sorry for making you all help out with...that.[VAR 0114(0043)]
Oh, I mean it was no big deal at all. Happy to\nhelp out, but...[VAR 0114(0006)]
Yeah, I gotta ask. Is everything OK with your\nsister? She seemed pretty, uh, riled up...[VAR 0114(0008)]
She’s not usually like that.[VAR 0114(0043)]
Well, that’s a relief.[VAR 0114(0008)]
I think she was just really excited to get to meet\nyou all.[VAR 0114(0043)]
You...really think that’s what that was?[VAR 0114(0006)]
Y-yeah. That’s...that’s gotta be why she’s dancing\nthat weird dance and screaming “Mochi mochi”...[VAR 0114(0043)]
How long has she been doing that?
Are you sure nothing happened?
I mean...she’s been like that since I sent you that\nletter, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0043)]
She was already dancin’ and all by the time I\nwoke up the next day. No explanation.[VAR 0114(0043)]
...I guess that really isn’t normal, is it?[VAR 0114(0043)]
Maybe the other folks in town are right... Maybe\nthis really IS a curse...[VAR 0114(0043)]
Wait, it could be a curse?![VAR 0114(0006)]
Wow, this trip just took a reeeal sudden dive into\nhorror movie territory...[VAR 0114(0008)]
I know zilch about curses, but could something\nlike this have happened before? You ever\r\nheard any old stories or legends about it?[VAR 0114(0004)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]I don’t know... [VAR 0100(0000)] already\ntook\r\ncare\r\nof\r\nthe\r\nwhole\r\nthing\r\nwith\r\nOgerpon\r\nand\r\nthe\r\nLoyal\r\nThree...[VAR 0114(0043)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Sheesh, [VAR 0100(0000)]. You really\njust\r\nrolled\r\non\r\nthrough\r\nthis\r\ntown\r\nlike\r\na\r\nlittle\r\nhurricane, huh?[VAR 0114(0006)]
My sis may have no filter...and be inconsiderate...\nand push people’s buttons...[VAR 0114(0043)]
but I’d still rather see her be her old self than\nwhatever this is![VAR 0114(0043)]
Yeah, for sure...[VAR 0114(0004)]
If there’s anything you think we can do to help,\njust say the word![VAR 0114(0006)]
Wha—?[VAR 0114(0043)]
Sure, we’ll help you out! I definitely don’t believe\nin horror movie tropes like curses anyway![VAR 0114(0008)]
Yeah, let’s do this! If we get to battle a curse, I’m\nso here for it![VAR 0114(0004)]
Y...you guys sure? You don’t mind?[VAR 0114(0043)]
You can count on us!
Friends help one another!
[VAR 0100(0000)]...\c\nNo, all of you...\c\nThank you![VAR 0114(0043)]
It’s too late to start today, but I’d be real grateful\nif you all could help me out tomorrow![VAR 0114(0043)]
First we’re gonna have a proper welcome party\ntonight at the community center![VAR 0114(0043)]
                             Let’s do it!\n  Aye-aye!                                         Count me in![VAR 0114(004C)]
All your friends are really good people. I’m\njealous![VAR 0114(0043)]
Curses and supernatural stuff like that are\ntotally unscientific. Nothing scary about ’em.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Hey, if my best friend’s friend is in trouble, then\nI’ll pull out all the stops to help ’em out![VAR 0114(0006)]
If this is something we can beat by battling,\nthen you know I’m all over it![VAR 0114(0004)]

Yup, no problem! It’s so close-by![VAR 0114(0004)]
There was nobody there, so I just left money\non the counter. Do you think that was OK?[VAR 0114(0004)]
Oh yeah, the old lady who runs it steps away\nsometimes, so everybody does that. No worries.[VAR 0114(0043)]
Man... I can’t imagine anyone getting away with\nthat back in Paldea![VAR 0114(0006)]
Wait. Nemona. What’s all over your mouth?\nWere you eating snacks without us?![VAR 0114(0008)]
When I see a “Help yourself” sign, I don’t ignore\nit! There was just one mochi left, though.[VAR 0114(0004)]
Hey, Kieran! D’you have any idea how to change\nthe channel on this TV? It just keeps playing this\r\nsame tourism video over and over![VAR 0114(0006)]
Oh—the caretaker hid the remote somewhere, so\nthat video’s all we can get on the TV.[VAR 0114(0043)]
OK, crew! New goal: find that clicker so we can\nall watch a movie or something![VAR 0114(0006)]
It’s gotta be around here somewhere, right?!\nWe just need to find it![VAR 0114(0006)]
Oh! Uh... Huh. Why didn’t I think of that?[VAR 0114(0043)]
Time to search this place top to bottom! And\nthen I vote we play games up on that big screen![VAR 0114(0008)]
Haha, it’s like our own little Treasure Hunt!\nEveryone, grab a corner and start searching![VAR 0114(0004)]
I’m in!
No way!
Heh heh! You agree my plan is genius, huh?[VAR 0114(0006)]
What’s the matter—you worried we’ll get in\ntrouble or something? Just relax![VAR 0114(0006)]
H-how about this, then...[VAR 0114(0043)]
Let’s say that whoever finds the remote gets to\ndecide what we do![VAR 0114(0043)]
Hey! Kieran! No fair getting a head start![VAR 0114(0006)]
The caretaker wouldn’t have put it in one of the\nbathrooms...right?[VAR 0114(0008)]
No luck with the drawers in the desk here! Guess\nthat would’ve been too obvious, huh?[VAR 0114(0006)]
Hmmm, the caretaker never really goes through\nhere, does he? Maybe it’s somewhere else...[VAR 0114(0043)]
... ... ...[VAR 0114(0004)]
Everyone’s busy looking for the remote!\nYou can’t just leave them behind!

Hm? There’s something in this planter...
You found the remote control for the TV!
What! No way! That means you get to choose\nwhat we do![VAR 0114(0006)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Wowzers!\n’Course\r\nyou\r\nfound\r\nit\r\nfirst,\r\n[VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0043)]
Hey, friend. You agree with me that we should\nuse that big ol’ screen to play games, riiight?[VAR 0114(0008)]
Huh? Where’d Nemona go off to? She in the\nbathroom or something?[VAR 0114(0006)]
No, I was checking around there earlier—I’m\npretty sure I would’ve seen her go in.[VAR 0114(0008)]
She didn’t head into the rooms in the back either.\nI was by the door to the hallway this whole time.[VAR 0114(0043)]
I think I know what’s going on...[VAR 0114(0006)]
She must be waiting to jump out and scare us![VAR 0114(0006)]
Hmm. I tried her phone, but she’s not picking up.[VAR 0114(0008)]
You tried calling her?[VAR 0114(0006)]
I didn’t hear her phone ring or anything. That’s...\nweird.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Huh...that is weird.[VAR 0114(0008)]
So...does that help us figure out where she is?[VAR 0114(0043)]
She’s probably outside
She’s not here, at least
Hmmm...maybe she was so set on finding that\nremote that she went outdoors to look for it?[VAR 0114(0008)]
I guess that’d make sense...[VAR 0114(0006)]
Maybe she forgot to get something at the shop?[VAR 0114(0043)]
I just hope she didn’t wander out of town...\c\nKitakami’s dangerous at night if you don’t know\nyour way around.[VAR 0114(0043)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]...I think [VAR 0100(0000)] and I should\ngo\r\nlook\r\noutside.[VAR 0114(0043)]
Arven, Penny—can you two stay here for now?[VAR 0114(0043)]
Wha—? But...[VAR 0114(0006)]
What if she comes back while we’re all out? We\nhave a better chance of finding her if you stay\r\nhere, and you can call us if she does.[VAR 0114(0043)]
That’s true... OK! But be careful out there![VAR 0114(0006)]
We’ll hold down the fort till you get back.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Let’s go, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0043)]
Be careful! It’s already pretty dark outside.[VAR 0114(0006)]
I hope Nemona’s all right...\c\nAll that talk about curses made my hair stand on\nend...seriously, worse than a Jolteon’s![VAR 0114(0008)]

Huh? There’re still some people out?[VAR 0114(0043)]
It’s hard to tell with the sun down...but I think\nthose two are workers from the orchard.[VAR 0114(0043)]
Why don’t we go ask ’em if they’ve seen\nNemona?[VAR 0114(0043)]
Let’s go ask those two if they’ve seen Nemona.[VAR 0114(0043)]

Mo...chi...chi...[VAR 0114(003A)]
Phew... That scared the snot outta me...[VAR 0114(0043)]
What’s gotten into them?! They were perfectly\nfine when I saw them yesterday![VAR 0114(0043)]
What the heck is going on around here?![VAR 0114(0043)]
They were acting like Carmine!
Maybe there really is a curse?!
Hey, you’re right! The weird dancing and yelling...\nIt’s what my sis was doin’![VAR 0114(0043)]
Did these two get wrapped up in this whole\ncurse thing too?[VAR 0114(0043)]
Aw man... I can’t believe Nemona vanished at a\ntime like this... We could really use her help.[VAR 0114(0043)]
Nemona?!
There she is!
Sure looked like her, all right...[VAR 0114(0043)]
She ran off toward Kitakami Hall... Why?\nC’mon, we should go after her.[VAR 0114(0043)]

[VAR BD06(0000)]Hello there, Kieran. And to you too,\n[VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0030)]
Grandpa! Grandma![VAR 0114(0043)]
What’re you both doing here? Is Carmine OK?!\nAnd did you see a girl come by here?![VAR 0114(0043)]
Slow down, Kieran. One question at a time.[VAR 0114(0030)]
Carmine is at home, sleeping in her room. She\nmust’ve tuckered herself out with all that dancing.[VAR 0114(0030)]
Phew... So she’s safe...[VAR 0114(0043)]
We thought we’d step out while she slept to get\nsome of her favorite noodles from the stall here.[VAR 0114(0030)]
A taste of her favorite food might help snap her\nout of whatever is going on with her.[VAR 0114(0030)]
Oh... Yeah, I hope so. Good thinking, Grandpa.[VAR 0114(0043)]
Now, what was that you were asking about some\ngirl coming this way?[VAR 0114(0030)]
Oh! Right! Everyone in town is actin’ all weird.[VAR 0114(0043)]
And one of the girls who came here from Paldea\nwent missing![VAR 0114(0043)]
She’s wearing a school uniform!
She’s really loud and full of energy!
Well, now that you mention it, we did run into a\ngirl wearing a uniform not too long ago.[VAR 0114(0030)]
Well, now that you mention it, we did run into a\nrather boisterous stranger in the village earlier.[VAR 0114(0030)]
You spoke with her, dear. What did she say?[VAR 0114(0030)]
... ... ...[VAR 0114(0037)]
Dearest?[VAR 0114(0030)]
Have some mochi.[VAR 0114(0037)]

This is awfully sudden, dear. But I suppose if you\ninsist...[VAR 0114(0030)]

All right, I’ve had some mochi, dear. Now can we\nget back to the question?[VAR 0114(0030)]
Hm...?[VAR 0114(0030)]

Gramps and Grandma too? Everyone’s losing it...[VAR 0114(0043)]
It’s just a matter of time until it gets me...[VAR 0114(0043)]
I’m gonna end up like all the rest of ’em![VAR 0114(0043)]
Calm down!
We’ll stop it!

[VAR BD06(0000)]I kinda panicked there... Thanks,\n[VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0043)]
OK, let’s think... Before Gramps started acting\nlike Carmine, he ate some of that weird mochi...[VAR 0114(0043)]

We’re doing OK!
How’re you two?
Yeah? Thank goodness. Just hearing your voice\nis helping me calm down.[VAR 0114(0006)]
We’re fine over here! Though Penny got herself\nall spooked and has been kind of a mess.[VAR 0114(0006)]
We got worried because we hadn’t heard from\nyou in a while, so we decided to step outside...\r\nand things are WEIRD out here, little buddy.[VAR 0114(0006)]
We were attacked by all these folks shouting\n“Mochi mochi!” at us, and we couldn’t spot you\r\nanywhere, so I was beginning to fear the worst![VAR 0114(0006)]
We’re holding tight by that Peachy’s place for\nthe moment, but—[VAR 0114(0006)]
Eek! Eyaaauuughhh! There’s something there!\nThere’s SOMETHING THERE, Arven![VAR 0114(0008)]

It was all Penny’s fault.\c\nShe went into full panic mode and ran smack into\nme. With her head. So I dropped my phone.[VAR 0114(0006)]

“Weird thing”? What’re you talking about?[VAR 0114(0043)]
It was, like, round and little...and WEIRD![VAR 0114(0008)]

That’s right! My old partner! How are you,\npartner—I mean, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0046)]
Whoa! Perrin!
Do I know you...?
That’s right! Good ol’ Perrin is still kicking\naround! You’re doing well yourself, eh?[VAR 0114(0046)]
Now, come on! Don’t you pull that on me!\c\nYou remember your old pal Perrin, right? I can’t\nbelieve you’re actually that heartless![VAR 0114(0046)]
I sure appreciated all the help you gave me back\nin Kitakami, tracking down the Bloodmoon Beast.[VAR 0114(0046)]
I never thought I’d just bump into you like this.\nHow about I teach you a new pose to celebrate![VAR 0114(0046)]
You learned the [VAR FF00(0008)]Looking Good! emote[VAR FF00(0000)] from\nPerrin!
Oh! And you even managed to evolve that\nGrowlithe I entrusted to you?![VAR 0114(0046)]
He looks great! That’s one splendid specimen\nof an Arcanine![VAR 0114(0046)]
Look at that, Growlithe! Your brother’s been\nso well taken care of. And now you’re reunited![VAR 0114(0046)]
Grawa!
Oh! And that’s the Growlithe I entrusted to you!\nSo you’ve been adventuring together, huh?[VAR 0114(0046)]
Look at that, Growlithe! It’s your brother! I told\nyou that you’d meet each other again![VAR 0114(0046)]
Grawa!
Oh! But what about that Growlithe I entrusted\nto you? Is he doing all right?[VAR 0114(0046)]
I hope you put him on your team sometimes\nand do a bit of adventuring together![VAR 0114(0046)]
Grawww...
So you’re here as some sorta exchange student,\nhuh? Nice![VAR 0114(0046)]
What a coincidence—I just started working here!\nAs a photographer, of course![VAR 0114(0046)]
That’s amazing!
Just what I’d expect!
Heh heh! Yeah, it pretty much is, right?[VAR 0114(0046)]
Heh heh! That’s typical me, eh?[VAR 0114(0046)]
Though I’m still sort of waiting to hear if the\nschool likes my work, to be fair.[VAR 0114(0046)]
They say they want snapshots of the Terarium and\nthe students and all for upcoming marketing stuff,\r\nso...how about some photos of you?[VAR 0114(0046)]
Ah! Speaking of photos, I’ve got a [VAR FF00(0006)]hot tip[VAR FF00(0000)] I could\nlet you in on![VAR 0114(0046)]
But if I told you, I bet you’d just go running right\noff...[VAR 0114(0046)]
How about this: I’ll snap some candid shots of\nyou catching tons of Pokémon in the Terarium.\r\nDon’t worry—you won’t even notice I’m nearby![VAR 0114(0046)]
If I make enough headway in my work by the\ntime you register, say...200 Pokémon in the\r\nBlueberry Pokédex, I’ll share that [VAR FF00(0006)]hot tip[VAR FF00(0000)]![VAR 0114(0046)]

It was hard work!
It was nothing!
Well, look at you, putting in all that effort!\nI like to see that in a kid.[VAR 0114(0046)]
Hahaha! Nothing, was it? All right, look at you,\nPokémon master. What a little stinker![VAR 0114(0046)]
You probably know more about the Pokémon in\nthe Terarium than I do—and I got here first![VAR 0114(0046)]
I guess you’ve earned yourself that [VAR FF00(0006)]hot tip[VAR FF00(0000)]![VAR 0114(0046)]
Take a look at these photos, would you?[VAR 0114(0046)]
See those strange Pokémon?\c\nThat first one’s called [VAR FF00(0006)]Gouging Fire[VAR FF00(0000)], and that\nother one’s [VAR FF00(0006)]Raging Bolt[VAR FF00(0000)].[VAR 0114(0046)]

Totally unknown Pokémon in totally unknown\nplaces! If they’re real, it’d be a huge deal![VAR 0114(0046)]
Apparently these places are in Paldea... You have\nany idea where, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0046)]
Wow! Are they famous spots? I want to visit\nthem![VAR 0114(0046)]
So they aren’t somewhere you can easily reach,\nthen? Wow, these spots must be really special.[VAR 0114(0046)]
Of course, you know how it is these days, right?\nThese photos could totally be fakes.[VAR 0114(0046)]
But if you want to know for sure, maybe you\ncould go try to search these Pokémon out![VAR 0114(0046)]
I can show you the photos again anytime you\nlike. Just give me a shout.[VAR 0114(0046)]

That’s a real-life Gouging Fire! Just look at the\nshape of its head![VAR 0114(0046)]
There are rumors that say this fellow can make\nmagma erupt from the ground just by roaring![VAR 0114(0046)]
That’s a real-life Iron Boulder! That thing is\nBUILT! Wow.[VAR 0114(0046)]
Rumors say that this fellow charges its horns\nwith energy, then uses them to plow through\r\neverything in its path![VAR 0114(0046)]
A real Raging Bolt! That neck is... Boy, that neck!\nIt’s almost too much to fit in one frame![VAR 0114(0046)]
Rumor has it that this fellow can cover the whole\nsky with dark clouds and bring lightning crashing\r\ndown, just by swinging that long neck around![VAR 0114(0046)]
A real Iron Crown! It’s so...so mecha![VAR 0114(0046)]
Rumor has it that this fellow can fire off beams\nfrom its horns that’ll cut through anything at all![VAR 0114(0046)]
Hahaha! If that were true, then this thing would\nbe a real fearsome threat to face!\c\nNow let me just snap a couple of photos here...[VAR 0114(0046)]
This could mean the other Pokémon I showed you\nis real, too. Report back to me if you find it, OK?[VAR 0114(0046)]
Wow...you actually went and found them both!\c\nI can’t even be surprised—that’s just like you,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0046)]
Between you and me, I was having a hard time\nfocusing on my own work... I couldn’t keep my\r\nmind off of those photos. You saved me![VAR 0114(0046)]
I know I didn’t promise any rewards or anything,\nbut I’ve got to thank you for putting the mystery\r\nto rest. Here you go! This prize is a real catch![VAR 0114(0046)]
It’s wild how much mystery is left in the world,\nisn’t it?[VAR 0114(0046)]
When you’re a kid, you can just run wholehearted\nwherever you want, but it’s not so easy when you\r\nget older.[VAR 0114(0046)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]You keep running, [VAR 0100(0000)].\nFind\r\nunknown\r\nPokémon,\r\nhave\r\ngrand\r\nadventures...\r\nDo\r\nit\r\nfor me![VAR 0114(0046)]
And now I think I’d better get back to work![VAR 0114(0046)]
They keep adding more and more functions to\nthese camera apps, you know?\c\nAs a photographer, I guess I’ve gotta be able to\nuse filters and all that to stay cool, huh?[VAR 0114(0046)]
Don’t just say hi to me all the time. Remember to\ngive Growlithe a bit of love too!\c\nI think he remembers your scent. He seems to\nreally like you![VAR 0114(0046)]
This Terarium really is something out of this\nworld. It’s hard to remember we’re under the sea.\c\nAnd you can simply stroll from an ice-covered\nmountain to a tropical island?!\c\nIt’s a photographer’s dream, being able to take\nphotos of all these different environments![VAR 0114(0046)]
You remember those photos I took of you with\nthe Bloodmoon Beast? Even though they didn’t\r\nturn out great, they’re still some of my favorites.\c\nI treasure every last picture I took that night![VAR 0114(0046)]

There’re more books than I can read in a lifetime.\nBoy, am I ever glad I came to this school!
I feel like I can grow stronger if I sign up for\nbattle studies!
You know, you can get a lot of battle tips from\nMs. Tyme’s math class too.
I really like language class! It doesn’t have too\nmuch to do with Pokémon, though...
[~ 76]
Occulture is such a weird magazine! It’s just full\nof utter nonsense!
[~ 76]
[~ 76]
[~ 76]
Don’t think I’ve ever seen a school where the\nentrance was also the library!
[~ 76]
I’m pretty good at Pokémon battles but I have\ntrouble studying...\c\nThink you can help me prep for our next exam?
I’m really good at my studies, but Pokémon\nbattles are another story...\c\nDo you think you can help me become stronger?
[~ 76]
There’s a book about the Herba Mystica—I know\nthere is—but where could it be...?
[~ 76]
Hey, did you know that this school was\nestablished 805 years ago?
[~ 76]
[~ 76]
[~ 76]
Isn’t it impressive? Everyone here is here to study!
Are you going for the STEM track? Or maybe\nthe humanities track? If you’re into Pokémon,\r\nthen the general studies track might be good?
[~ 76]

I’m from a small town called Alfornada! There’s\nso many people here at the school!

There’s this girl named Penny in the STEM track.\nShe’s smart and really good with machines.\c\nI heard she’s started coming to school again.
Reading out loud from your textbook gets your\nears and mouth in on the learning!
I joined the school because I wanted to learn\nabout Pokémon, but now I’m getting interested\r\nin the STEM track too!
Bug types eat grass—that’s why they’re strong\nagainst Grass types!
I asked so many questions that the teacher\nlearned my name on the first day!
So between a Super Potion and a Hyper Potion,\nwhich one heals your Pokémon more?
Have you heard of Team Star? They were a big\nproblem around here—but that was a while ago.
[~ 76]
I’m telling you—I’m not a teacher, I’m a student!\nI’m wearing the uniform, aren’t I?!
Steel-type moves are super effective against\nFairy-type Pokémon... Did I get that right?
It’s so hard to figure out the type matchups of\nPokémon with two types...
It’s great that night classes are available here.\nI can work during the day and still learn!
I stay up late at night because it seems like a\nwaste to let the day end early...but then I regret\r\nit the next morning.
I saw a Pokémon drop a coin. I kept the coin so\nI could give it back, but the Pokémon was so tiny\r\nthat I haven’t been able to find it since.
[~ 76]
[~ 76]
[~ 76]
[~ 76]
[~ 76]
They say there are some Pokémon that’ll evolve\nif you have them walk with you for a long time.
[~ 76]
[~ 76]
[~ 76]
The school is so mysterious at night! You meet\ncompletely different people than during the day!\c\nDid you know that outside towns, different\nPokémon come out at night too?
[~ 76]
It’s an honor to be able to study here at the\nalma mater of a famous professor.
[~ 76]

This kid Arven in my class seems like he’s been\nhaving a rough time since, like, last year. I know\r\nhow hard it must be for him.

Why? What happened to them?[VAR 0114(001E)]
As the former director of the academy, I believe\nI am best positioned to answer that question.[VAR 0114(003C)]
Mr. Harrington...[VAR 0114(0020)]
About 18 months ago, the members of Team Star\nconfronted the students who used to bully them,\r\nand an altercation broke out between the groups.[VAR 0114(003C)]
Though it did not escalate into a major incident,\nthe altercation nonetheless caused a scandal of\r\nhitherto unknown proportions.[VAR 0114(003C)]
As a result of what occurred that day, the\nstudents who had perpetrated the bullying\r\ndropped out of the academy, one after another.[VAR 0114(003C)]
But...but there aren’t any records of that\nanywhere in the academy![VAR 0114(001E)]
No, I should imagine not. My former deputy\ndeleted all records of the incident, you see.[VAR 0114(003C)]
What?! Why would anyone do that?[VAR 0114(001E)]
Just as I was puzzling over how best to deal with\nTeam Star in the aftermath of the incident, a\r\ncertain student came to see me.[VAR 0114(003C)]
This student declared that they would take all\nresponsibility for the team’s actions.[VAR 0114(003C)]
In exchange, they requested that I exonerate the\nother students of Team Star from any blame.[VAR 0114(003C)]
HUH?! No...no one told me that![VAR 0114(0020)]
I accepted the request and agreed not to take\ndisciplinary action against Team Star.[VAR 0114(003C)]
Then, I assigned 18 months of overseas study to\nthe student who took responsibility for the team.[VAR 0114(003C)]
A year and a half of studying abroad...?[VAR 0114(001E)]
This was not intended as a punishment, you\nunderstand. Team Star were the victims, after all.[VAR 0114(003C)]
I wanted this student to take some time to rest,\nso I had them return home to the Galar region\r\nunder the pretext of “overseas study.”[VAR 0114(003C)]
Around that time, however, the former deputy\ndirector took it upon himself to erase all traces\r\nof the incident from the academy’s servers.\c\nIt appears his intent was to shield himself from\nany blame.[VAR 0114(003C)]
So he tried to cover up the whole thing?\nThat’s terrible![VAR 0114(001E)]
After we discovered what he had done, I dealt\nwith him appropriately, of course.[VAR 0114(003C)]
But the inability of myself and the rest of the\nteaching staff to prevent this terrible act also\r\nrepresented a grave blunder on our part.[VAR 0114(003C)]
I accepted the blame that lay at my feet and\nresigned from my position as director.\c\nThe rest of the teaching staff then joined me in\nhanding in their notices.[VAR 0114(003C)]
So that’s why the current teachers were all\nbrought in a year and a half ago...[VAR 0114(001E)]
I understand my actions have caused you a great\ndeal of trouble. You have my sincere apologies.[VAR 0114(003C)]
Hang on, Mr. Harrington! How come you\nsuddenly decided to talk about this now?![VAR 0114(0020)]
Young Master Ortega... Team Star cannot carry\non in its current fashion. I merely wish to give you\r\na chance to chart a better course.[VAR 0114(003C)]
Well, there’s no way I’m abandoning my friends\nand going to school without them. Not after\r\nwe’ve come this far![VAR 0114(0020)]
Your friends in Team Star must mean a great deal\nto you.[VAR 0114(001E)]
Isn’t that obvious?[VAR 0114(0020)]
It’s ’cause, you know...they’re my greatest\ntreasure in the whole world.[VAR 0114(0020)]

Well, I’unno about you, but I’m thinkin’ let’s\nseal this exclusivity deal! Contract tiiime![VAR 0114(0019)]
...has been cancelled, ’cause I forgot to bring the\ncontract. Oops![VAR 0114(0019)]
So if we can’t contract it up, let’s con-trade it up!\nWanna swap some Pokémon?![VAR 0114(0019)]
All righty, then! What’ll you gimme-gimme-gimme\nfor my li’l Magnemite friendo?[VAR 0114(0019)]

[VAR BD06(0000)]You’re down to trade your [VAR 0101(0001)] for\nmy\r\nMagnemite?![VAR 0114(0019)]
You can’t trade Iono a Pokémon if you aren’t its\noriginal Trainer!
You can’t trade Iono such a rare Pokémon!
You can’t trade Iono a Shiny Pokémon!
Oh noes! You’ve only got one Pokémon with you!\c\nYou know we can’t get to tradin’ unless you’ve\ngot at least two Pokémon![VAR 0114(0019)]
Gweh! I am le shocked! Good thing I am le very,\nvery patient![VAR 0114(0019)]
Ready to con-trade it up and make your\nexclusivity with the Iono Zone kinda-official?!\r\nLet’s tradeify![VAR 0114(0019)]

Awww man, I lost! Dot dot dot...BUT! Look at\nthose viewer numbers! This is bitter-suh-weet![VAR 0114(0019)]
Wait...did my loyal fans just wanna see how I’d\nreact losing to a Champion?![VAR 0114(0019)]
...Meh! Viewer numbers are viewer numbers!\c\nAs thanks, here’s an SSS-tier drop!\nSome mega-exclusive Iono merch![VAR 0114(0019)]
Can’t wait for our next collab![VAR 0114(0019)]

We got chat blowin’ up again! Nyehehe![VAR 0114(0019)]
Your eyeballs were MINE—caught in my\nElectroweb! Whowasawhatwasit? Iono![VAR 0114(0019)]
Nyahaha! Who won this time? I know, Iono!\c\nBut my viewer numbers zoomed up way less than\nusual! Whyfore?![VAR 0114(0019)]
My viewer count’s been poppin’ off ever since I\nstarted this Blueberry streaming shindiggery!\c\nIf the viewer numbers stay this sweet, I might just\nhave to move here![VAR 0114(0019)]
A lot of my loyal fans are still in school, so lotsa\nBlueberry peeps know about Iono!\c\nGuess the Supercharged Streamer has the right\nvoltage no matter where she goes![VAR 0114(0019)]
So y’know how my whole “’Ello, ’ello, hola! Ciao\nand bonjour!” thing is a buncha different\r\ngreetings all mashed up?\c\nThat means it’s universal! You can use it anytime,\nanywhere, with anyone! Who’s a genius?! Meee![VAR 0114(0019)]

Hello there.[VAR 0114(001C)]
Did someone order a little of my makeup magic?[VAR 0114(001C)]
[VAR BD06(0000)][VAR 0100(0000)], darling! It’s been\nmuch\r\ntoo\r\nlong![VAR 0114(001C)]
When I heard you’d requested my coaching\nservices, I couldn’t wait![VAR 0114(001C)]
I hopped right in one of those chic Flying Taxis\nand had ’em get me here chop-chop.[VAR 0114(001C)]
I’m a little worried my class will overstimulate\nthese kids, though.[VAR 0114(001C)]
But you’ll take the fall for me if anything goes\nwrong, won’t you?[VAR 0114(001C)]
Glad to hear you’d be my knight in sparkly lip\ngloss! But don’t worry, darling—I was kidding.[VAR 0114(001C)]
Awww. Got you shook with that one, did I?\nDon’t worry, cutie—I was only kidding.[VAR 0114(001C)]
I’m absolutely thrilled you invited me back.[VAR 0114(001C)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]By the way, [VAR 0100(0000)], do you\nremember\r\nwhat\r\nline\r\nof\r\nwork\r\nI’m in?[VAR 0114(001C)]
You’re a flight attendant!
You’re a made-up artist!
You’re a makeup artist!
[VAR BD06(0000)]No, no, [VAR 0100(0000)], not at all.\nThough\r\nflight\r\nattendants\r\ndo\r\ntend\r\nto\r\nlook\r\nimpeccable,\r\nlike me.\c\nI’m a makeup artist. Do remember that![VAR 0114(001C)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]No, no, [VAR 0100(0000)], not at all.\nNow\r\nBrassius,\r\nthat\r\noddball\r\nwho\r\nchurns\r\nout\r\nstrange\r\nstatues...\r\nYou\r\ncould\r\ncall\r\nHIM\r\na\r\n“made-up”\r\nartist.\c\nI’m a MAKE-up artist. Do remember that![VAR 0114(001C)]
Perfecto! You got it—I’m a makeup artist!\c\nAlong with, of course, modeling on the side.\nAnd Gym leading on the other side.[VAR 0114(001C)]
Not many people here know me, but when I tell\nthem what I do, they perk right up.[VAR 0114(001C)]
As well-known as the name Tulip is in Paldea,\nhere no one knows me from the next flower.[VAR 0114(001C)]
I’ve got to find a way to tastefully bottle the\nsecret to my beauty. I’d love it if anyone in the\r\nworld could just buy the total package![VAR 0114(001C)]
Do you remember the promise you made me,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(001C)]
Good on you, holding on to the advice your\nelders give you![VAR 0114(001C)]
Hmmm. I’ll let you off the hook just this once,\nsince it’s cute that you’re a little forgetful.[VAR 0114(001C)]
When you promised to never fade away, to show\nme how far your talent can go...[VAR 0114(001C)]
I never even dreamed you’d follow through this\nbeautifully! I’m absolutely shook, darling![VAR 0114(001C)]
You could come work for my company when you\ngrow up, you know. With your talent, you could\r\naim for the very top! I’d hire you—I promise![VAR 0114(001C)]
Sounds great!
I’ll think about it
Hehe! I don’t need a final answer just yet.[VAR 0114(001C)]
I think we should do something special to\ncommemorate this new promise I’ve made you![VAR 0114(001C)]
What’d be a fitting way to make this memory\npop...?[VAR 0114(001C)]
I know! Why don’t we trade Pokémon?[VAR 0114(001C)]
Hehe! I hoped you’d say yes. I’m willing to trade\nyou my little Flittle. Who would you trade?[VAR 0114(001C)]
Oh, your aesthetic sense is simply stunning. What\na sweet choice [VAR 0101(0001)] is. Hehe!\c\nI’ll take it under my wing and mentor it with\nloving care![VAR 0114(001C)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]You’re willing to trade your dear\n[VAR 0101(0001)]\r\nfor\r\nmy\r\nlittle\r\nFlittle?[VAR 0114(001C)]
You can’t trade Tulip a Pokémon if you aren’t its\noriginal Trainer!
You can’t trade Tulip such a rare Pokémon!
You can’t trade Tulip a Shiny Pokémon!
No, no, this won’t do. You can’t go trading when\nyou’ve only got one Pokémon with you.\c\nIf you had at least two, I could trade with you...[VAR 0114(001C)]
All right. Just try to come back before I change\nmy mind, would you?[VAR 0114(001C)]
I knew you’d come back. So, are you ready to\ntrade with me?[VAR 0114(001C)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Hello, [VAR 0100(0000)]. Are you ready\nto\r\npursue\r\nquintessential\r\nbeauty\r\ntogether?[VAR 0114(001C)]
Look at you! Such a star you can even decline an\ninvite from me![VAR 0114(001C)]
Oh, wonderful. Let’s head to the battle court.[VAR 0114(001C)]
[~ 59]
You’ve got it all! Beauty, strength...even magic![VAR 0114(001C)]
I’m glad to see you’re keeping your promise.[VAR 0114(001C)]
You might even have enough potential to be a\nbigger star than me one day. So let’s call this\r\na little interstellar gift from me to you.[VAR 0114(001C)]
Well, it’s not such a “little” gift, but that’s OK.\nYou can pay me back when you make it big.[VAR 0114(001C)]
[~ 59]
Well, in terms of beauty, I suppose we’re tied.\nHere’s a little something for you.[VAR 0114(001C)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Battle me again sometime,\n[VAR 0100(0000)].\r\nHehe![VAR 0114(001C)]
Looks like I slayed—in battle and in beauty.\c\nBut don’t despair! Keep that cute chin up and try\nagain sometime, would you?[VAR 0114(001C)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]You know my calendar is full, but if you need me,\n[VAR 0100(0000)], I’ll be there\r\nchop-chop.[VAR 0114(001C)]
Is Dendra doing all right as a schoolteacher?\nShe’s always been a little rash.[VAR 0114(001C)]
Life gets boring if you just stand around with the\nsame posture all the time, you know?\c\nIf you get antsy from staying still...just bust out\nyour Emotional Spectrum Practice poses! Hehe![VAR 0114(001C)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Your dear [VAR 0101(0001)] is a superb base for\nmy\r\nmakeup\r\nmagic.\c\nDon’t worry—I’ll raise it up beautifully![VAR 0114(001C)]
How’s my little Flittle faring, by the way?\c\nYou’ll find Flittle’s strong AND beautiful. I think\nyou’ll be positively shook![VAR 0114(001C)]
You know, I heard I’m your favorite of all the\nGym Leaders, [VAR 0100(0000)].\c\nBut I had to hear it from Geeta!\c\nIf you’d just told me yourself, I’d have taken you\nunder my wing that second!\c\nYou know you’re my absolute fave too, don’t\nyou? Look at us—best faves forever![VAR 0114(001C)]

You know who it is, baby![VAR 0114(001B)]
Someone here asked for a Ryme feature, huh?\nTime to show you all how to unleash the spirit![VAR 0114(001B)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]What’s good, [VAR 0100(0000)], my\nlittle\r\nchallenger?[VAR 0114(001B)]
People all around the world know who the one\nand only MC of RIP is...[VAR 0114(001B)]
so you got a lotta nerve havin’ me fly all the\nway here for a ghostly guest verse! Hahaha![VAR 0114(001B)]
I’m just kiddin’. If a Champion like you calls with\na nice offer, you know I’m pickin’ up![VAR 0114(001B)]
So you want me to treat these Blueberry kids to a\nlyrical lesson? I’m ready![VAR 0114(001B)]
Give ’em some bars, please!
No bars—just battling, please!
Hah! You’re down to go with the flow, huh, kid?\c\nDon’t worry—I’ll teach ’em a lesson on how to\nbattle, too![VAR 0114(001B)]
Hahaha! Don’t sweat it, kid. The school of Ryme’s\nnot takin’ new students—I’m here for battlin’![VAR 0114(001B)]
These Blueberry kids are big into Double Battles,\nhuh?[VAR 0114(001B)]
Same goes for me. Double Battles are deep!\nThey make you think from different angles![VAR 0114(001B)]
Two Pokémon dropping moves together like\nthey’re tradin’ bars—that’s my kind of battle![VAR 0114(001B)]
Interesting
Heck yeah!
“Interesting?” Hah! You talk like you’ve never\ndone a Double Battle before![VAR 0114(001B)]
Hah! Oh, you already know, baby![VAR 0114(001B)]
I’m all for more people bein’ into Double Battles.\nIt means more chances for me to shine![VAR 0114(001B)]
So I’m gonna teach these Blueberry babies how\nthe grown-ups do bone-rattlin’ Double Battles![VAR 0114(001B)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Hey, [VAR 0100(0000)]—relax a minute\nand\r\ntalk\r\nwith\r\nme![VAR 0114(001B)]
Listen, for real—I’m grateful you called me out\nhere to Blueberryland.[VAR 0114(001B)]
I get mad energy from bein’ surrounded by kids.\nAll their spirit powers me up.[VAR 0114(001B)]
You surprised to hear I like havin’ kids around?[VAR 0114(001B)]
Blown away!
Nah
Hah! You and the rest of the world, baby! That’s\nwhat happens when you’re a boss like me![VAR 0114(001B)]
Hah! That’s sweet of you, baby. You think I look\nlike a nice old DJ G-Randma?[VAR 0114(001B)]
I used to have a rough time dealin’ with kids.\nBut ever since becoming a grandparent, I’ve\r\nsoftened up to those little ones.[VAR 0114(001B)]
You know, you’re about the same age as my\ngrandkids. Makes this old softy’s eyes well up,\r\nseein’ you work so hard.[VAR 0114(001B)]
But this tender talk ain’t my style! I’ll leave you\nterrified, not teary-eyed! Haha![VAR 0114(001B)]
Time to bring the tempo back up. I know what\nwe can do to get things hoppin’![VAR 0114(001B)]
Whatcha say to some Pokémon trading,\nLil Champ [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(001B)]
I’ll trade you the one, the only: DJ G-Rave!\nHow’s that for a drop? Show me what you got![VAR 0114(001B)]
Thanks for takin’ the plunge—that trade was fun!\nI’ll train this one a ton till it’s grade A-1!\c\nFor real, I’ll take good care of it—body and soul.\nIt’ll be a real Double Battler soon![VAR 0114(001B)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Sure you’re good to trade your\n[VAR 0101(0001)]\r\nfor\r\nDJ G-Rave?[VAR 0114(001B)]
You can’t trade Ryme a Pokémon if you aren’t its\noriginal Trainer!
You can’t trade Ryme such a rare Pokémon!
You can’t trade Ryme a Shiny Pokémon!
Hold up—your party’s lookin’ too slim, baby!\nBring more Pokémon if you finna trade me![VAR 0114(001B)]
Aw, what? C’mon, don’t back out now![VAR 0114(001B)]
Whatcha say to some Pokémon trading with me,\nLil Champ [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(001B)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Let me hear it, [VAR 0100(0000)]. Ready\nto\r\nsquare\r\nup?[VAR 0114(001B)]
You’d rather pass on this battle, huh? Thought\nyou were more spirited than that![VAR 0114(001B)]
Hah! You already know! Let’s go head-to-head\nand soul-to-soul![VAR 0114(001B)]
Kid, you know I’m Double Battlin’ till the end!\nIf you wanna share the stage with me, you better\r\nbring at least two Pokémon!
Hah! Great battle—chilling AND thrilling![VAR 0114(001B)]
You got me in your corner, baby...in spirit. Not\nlike I can actually tag in for you, y’know?[VAR 0114(001B)]
I’m gonna hook you up with a pair of kicks from\nmy tour merch. Wear your soul on your soles![VAR 0114(001B)]
The fans go wild for those things, so treasure ’em\nto your grave![VAR 0114(001B)]
You received a pair of [VAR FF00(0008)]Ghost Sneakers [VAR FF00(0000)]from Ryme!
Your beatdowns hit different! I’ll be feelin’ that\nall the way to the afterlife![VAR 0114(001B)]
Till next time, baby! Hit me up if your spirit’s\nachin’ for a battle![VAR 0114(001B)]
How’d you like my show, baby? Seeing it live hits\ndifferent, huh? Haha!\c\nHit me up whenever you’re ready to step to me\nagain. A VIP like you gets in free![VAR 0114(001B)]
You heard my number-one single, “A Visit to My\nFather”?\c\nThe lyrics for that one came to me when I was\npayin’ respects at my dad’s grave.[VAR 0114(001B)]
That battle court in the entrance here is niiice.\c\nIt’s got seats around it and everything. Drop me\na beat and I could put on a show there.[VAR 0114(001B)]
Listen—don’t start nonsense and land yourself\nin trouble with my sister, Tyme!\c\nIf you set her off, she goes OFF. She’s scarier than\nI am—for real![VAR 0114(001B)]

How’s DJ G-Rave doin’ on the 1s and 2s? That\nfool loves dancin’ if you give him a beat![VAR 0114(001B)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Listen, [VAR 0100(0000)].

Brrrrrr... I’m freezing.[VAR 0114(001A)]
The AC’s way too strong in here...[VAR 0114(001A)]
So, you’re the one who called me, huh?[VAR 0114(001A)]
You DO know this is gonna be a major downer\nfor the school, right?[VAR 0114(001A)]
I can’t imagine how having me around is going to\nbenefit anybody here...[VAR 0114(001A)]
That’s not true!
You think...?
...You’re awfully sure about this. Where does that\nconfidence come from?[VAR 0114(001A)]
Hmph, I figured... You’re not sure about this\neither, are you?[VAR 0114(001A)]
Well, I’m here anyway. I’m going to do my job.[VAR 0114(001A)]
I am a professional, believe it or not...[VAR 0114(001A)]
You, huh...[VAR 0114(001A)]
Have you been to the Polar Biome in the\nTerarium? That place is pretty impressive.[VAR 0114(001A)]
The snow’s so soft and powdery... I can’t believe\nit’s artificial.[VAR 0114(001A)]
Plenty of straight slopes, and lots of curves too.\nIt’s perfect for snowboarding.[VAR 0114(001A)]
You’re gonna board?!
Let’s hit the slopes!
Oh, no, I didn’t mean it like that...[VAR 0114(001A)]
I can’t help but check out the slopes when I see\nsnowy mountains. Old habits die hard.[VAR 0114(001A)]
This academy’s something else though, eh?\nBuilding a mountain like that on school grounds...[VAR 0114(001A)]
I just came back from climbing that big mountain\nin the Polar Biome.[VAR 0114(001A)]
Cetoddle and the rest were all hyped to be on a\nmountain other than Glaseado.[VAR 0114(001A)]
I guess it rubbed off on me. I just couldn’t resist\nand, well...I had a few runs on my board.[VAR 0114(001A)]
Niiice!
How’d it go?
Oh, the snow was good. Yeah... Real good.[VAR 0114(001A)]
I hadn’t boarded in a long time, so I think I got\na bit too fired up.[VAR 0114(001A)]
You know, I’d made up my mind that I wouldn’t\nsnowboard anymore...[VAR 0114(001A)]
but maybe I can from time to time—just when\nI’m here.[VAR 0114(001A)]
...Yeah, yeah, I’m weak-willed. Sorry.[VAR 0114(001A)]
But if I’m gonna be uncool, I might as well lean\ninto it. I’ve got another tiresome idea.[VAR 0114(001A)]
What do you say we trade Pokémon?[VAR 0114(001A)]
Oh, you seriously want to? Well, OK.\c\nI’ll be trading a Cetoddle. What’ll you pick?[VAR 0114(001A)]
A [VAR 0101(0001)]... Yeah... That’s not bad.\c\nIt’d be way uncool if I raised your Pokémon\npoorly. I’ll make sure to take good care of it.[VAR 0114(001A)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]All right. My Cetoddle for your\n[VAR 0101(0001)],\r\nthen?[VAR 0114(001A)]
You can’t trade Grusha a Pokémon if you aren’t\nits original Trainer!
You can’t trade Grusha such a rare Pokémon!
You can’t trade Grusha a Shiny Pokémon!
Wait... Are you trying to trade away the only\nPokémon in your party? That’s real uncool...\c\nCome back when you have at least two Pokémon\nwith you.[VAR 0114(001A)]
...I was just kidding anyway. Don’t worry about it.[VAR 0114(001A)]
In the mood for something uncool? How about\na Pokémon trade?[VAR 0114(001A)]
What’s that look for? Do you want to battle me\nor something?[VAR 0114(001A)]
Yep. That’s the right decision.[VAR 0114(001A)]
Ugh, so uncool... But I guess dealing with stuff\nlike this from time to time isn’t too bad.[VAR 0114(001A)]
[~ 59]
Oof... That’s what I call a sound defeat. The icy\nbite of reality is harsh as always...[VAR 0114(001A)]
But I had fun. I think I learned a little something,\ntoo.[VAR 0114(001A)]
To the victor go the spoils. Here, you can have\nthese.[VAR 0114(001A)]
Just throw them away if you don’t need them.[VAR 0114(001A)]
[~ 59]
You really do seem to enjoy defeating me.[VAR 0114(001A)]
Well, next time the result will be much cooler...\nfor me and my team![VAR 0114(001A)]
Listen, going easy on me’s not gonna make me\nhappy, even if I do get to win.\c\nGo all out next time, OK?[VAR 0114(001A)]
I’m not great with students... I just imagine how\nthey might have to give up on their dreams in the\r\nfuture, and...it makes me feel so bad for ’em.[VAR 0114(001A)]
Seems like some people have heard of me all the\nway over here.\c\nThey keep asking me for photos... Taking one\nwith you was enough for me, though.[VAR 0114(001A)]
The AC is way too strong in here. Aren’t you\ncold, too?\c\nWho do I need to bother to get the heat\nturned up?[VAR 0114(001A)]
[VAR BD06(0000)][VAR 0101(0001)]’s doing pretty good. Gets\nalong\r\nfine\r\nwith\r\nmy\r\nother\r\nPokémon.\c\nIt’s real chill. I like it.[VAR 0114(001A)]
How’s that Cetoddle I traded you?\c\nHe has a tendency to wander off, so keep an eye\non him during picnics and stuff.[VAR 0114(001A)]
By the way... Geeta mentioned that you said I\nwas your favorite Gym Leader.\c\nI don’t know how you came to that conclusion...\nIt’s so uncool, seriously.\c\nBut, well...I appreciate the thought. So, uh...\nThanks, I guess.[VAR 0114(001A)]

My name is Katy, and I am the owner of\nPatisserie Soapberry in the Paldea region![VAR 0114(0016)]
Oh? That’s right, I was called here as a Gym\nLeader, not a patissier![VAR 0114(0016)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Oh, hello, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0016)]
I didn’t think I’d run into you in a faraway place\nlike this![VAR 0114(0016)]
I’m the one that called you
Small world, huh?
Oh, you’re the one who called me here? I’m\nflattered![VAR 0114(0016)]
Hmm, but you don’t seem very surprised to\nsee me here...\c\nOh, wait, don’t tell me—you’re the one who\ncalled me here, aren’t you?[VAR 0114(0016)]
Hehehe, now our chance encounter suddenly\nseems to make sense![VAR 0114(0016)]
Well then, I ought to slip into coach mode if I\nwas called here as such![VAR 0114(0016)]
I think it’s high time we taught this academy how\nlovely Bug-type Pokémon are![VAR 0114(0016)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Hey, [VAR 0100(0000)], guess what?[VAR 0114(0016)]
Not too long ago, I was taking a nice stroll\nthrough this school’s wonderful Terarium...[VAR 0114(0016)]
and I just so happened to run into an adorable\nlittle Bug-type Pokémon![VAR 0114(0016)]
It was a small thing—and so cute! Not only was it\na Bug type, but it was an Electric type, too!\c\nYou wouldn’t happen to know its name, would\nyou?[VAR 0114(0016)]
Elekid
Chinchou
Joltik
Hmm, no, I don’t think that’s it. That’s not even a\nbug Pokémon, is it?\c\nIt was letting out a little cry, like so: “Jol! Jol!”\nOh, could it have been a Joltik?[VAR 0114(0016)]
Yes, I think you’re right! Its cry sounded like\n“Jol! Jol!” too![VAR 0114(0016)]
And it seems like this is a bug Pokémon that can’t\nbe found in Paldea! How interesting![VAR 0114(0016)]
Maybe I’ll use that cute little Joltik as inspiration\nfor some new sweets![VAR 0114(0016)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Oh, [VAR 0100(0000)]! I’ve got a little\npop\r\nquiz\r\nfor\r\nyou![VAR 0114(0016)]
Do you think you can guess which Pokémon from\nthe Terarium newly joined my team?[VAR 0114(0016)]
[~ 63]
Galvantula
Araquanid
Ariados
[~ 63]
Oh no, that’s not quite right! Go on, think a little\nharder![VAR 0114(0016)]
Ding ding ding! You are correct, correct, correct!\nMy, you must’ve been keeping a close eye on me![VAR 0114(0016)]
Araquanid is a Water type, you know! And it\nlives near bodies of water![VAR 0114(0016)]
Why don’t you try to find it next time you’re\ntaking a stroll through the Terarium?[VAR 0114(0016)]
Thanks to you calling me here, I was able to\nmeet new bug Pokémon! I’m so happy![VAR 0114(0016)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Do you fancy becoming a bug Pokémon\nenthusiast yourself, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0016)]
Come on, let’s trade and get you a whooole\nbunch of bug Pokémon to train up![VAR 0114(0016)]
Wonderful! I have a Combee to trade—what\nabout you, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0016)]
[VAR BD06(0000)][VAR 1303(0001,0000)][VAR 0101(0001)]! How adorable, thank you!\nI’ll\r\nsee\r\nthat\r\nit\r\nundergoes a lovely metamorphosis![VAR 0114(0016)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]You’re sure you want to trade your\n[VAR 0101(0001)]\r\nfor\r\nmy\r\nCombee?[VAR 0114(0016)]
You can’t trade Katy a Pokémon if you aren’t its\noriginal Trainer!
You can’t trade Katy such a rare Pokémon!
You can’t trade Katy a Shiny Pokémon!
Oh? You can’t trade a Pokémon if it’s the only\none in your party!\c\nMake sure you have at least two and come see\nme again![VAR 0114(0016)]
Come see me again if you want to make a new\nbug Pokémon friend![VAR 0114(0016)]
Oh? Do you want to trade for a bug Pokémon\nafter all?[VAR 0114(0016)]
Oh, my! Could this be an invitation to battle?[VAR 0114(0016)]
Oh no, I suppose I was mistaken! Looks like I got\nahead of myself...[VAR 0114(0016)]
I can’t wait to get a taste of your tactics! I bet\nyou’ve really emerged from your cocoon since\r\nlast time![VAR 0114(0016)]
[~ 63]
I suppose I should expect no less from a Trainer\nsuch as you! You made quick work of my team![VAR 0114(0016)]
You really have grown into such a beautiful\nyoung Trainer![VAR 0114(0016)]
Could I interest you in a little dessert after your\nvictory?[VAR 0114(0016)]
I hope the road ahead of you continues to be\nsweet and gentle![VAR 0114(0016)]
[~ 63]
You’ve won against my lovely Bug-type Pokémon!\nWell done, sweetie![VAR 0114(0016)]
Hehe, I look forward to our next battle![VAR 0114(0016)]
Hehe, I managed to net a win against you! What\na wonderful feeling! Thanks for the battle![VAR 0114(0016)]
I just love taking walks in the Terarium!\c\nThere are oodles of Pokémon I’ve never seen\nbefore! They’ve given me so many ideas for\r\nnew sweets![VAR 0114(0016)]
It’s thanks to the hard work of my staff at\nPatisserie Soapberry that I’m able to go on\r\nexcursions like this!\c\nDon’t forget to cherish all the people who\nsupport you![VAR 0114(0016)]
You know those antennae Pokémon get when\nthey Terastallize to the Bug type?\c\nOh, they’re so cute! I wish all Pokémon had the\nBug Tera Type![VAR 0114(0016)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Your little [VAR 0101(0001)] has quite the\nappetite!\c\nIt’s happily gobbling up all the sweets I’ve been\nmaking for it![VAR 0114(0016)]
The Combee I traded you is a female, so you\ncan expect her to evolve into a Vespiquen![VAR 0114(0016)]
Oh, I just remembered something La Primera\ntold me!\c\nIt seems that you picked me as your favorite\nGym Leader?\c\nAren’t you just the sweetest! Thank you so much!\nI’ll make some cupcakes just for you sometime![VAR 0114(0016)]

Hello. I’m here on behalf of the Paldea region’s\nPokémon League.[VAR 0114(0015)]
It’s a pleasure to be doing business with you.[VAR 0114(0015)]
...Oh. It’s you.[VAR 0114(0015)]
Calling me all the way out to another region...\nIs a certain chairwoman rubbing off on you?[VAR 0114(0015)]
Actually, don’t worry about it. To be honest,\nI don’t mind these little business trips.[VAR 0114(0015)]
I know I’m here for work, but I may as well enjoy\nmyself while I’m at it.[VAR 0114(0015)]
Speaking of which, I’ve heard that Unova has two\nparticularly famous dishes—Berry sandwiches and\r\nCasteliacones. Which one appeals to you more?[VAR 0114(0015)]
Berry sandwiches
Casteliacones
Ah, I see. It figures you would be more interested\nin the sandwiches.[VAR 0114(0015)]
Ah, I see. I suppose you must have a sweet tooth.[VAR 0114(0015)]
Well, thanks for the input...[VAR 0114(0015)]
Once I’m done with my lecture, I’ll step out and\neat my fill.[VAR 0114(0015)]
Oh. You again.[VAR 0114(0015)]
I tried out those Berry sandwiches we discussed.\c\nThey were pretty good, actually—a nice change\nof pace from the usual Paldean sandwiches.\c\nStaraptor kept pecking at mine, though... I guess\nthe Berries used in the sandwich filling must’ve\r\nbeen to its liking.[VAR 0114(0015)]
I tried out those Casteliacones we discussed.\nThey were far more satisfying than I’d expected.\c\nThe texture was nice and fluffy, but the flavor was\nso rich—almost decadent.\c\nThe Nacli Salt Ice Cream from Sugar-N-Ice back\nin Paldea is hard to beat, but Casteliacones\r\ndefinitely come close, since they contain only\r\nthe finest ingredients...[VAR 0114(0015)]
I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to go on like that.[VAR 0114(0015)]
It’s just that the best part of traveling is trying out\nall the local dishes, if you ask me.\c\nThe topic tends to make me talkative.[VAR 0114(0015)]
There’s something special about having nice,\nfamiliar rice balls once you’re back home, too...[VAR 0114(0015)]
By the way...\c\nHave you had a chance to visit the cafeteria here\nat Blueberry Academy?[VAR 0114(0015)]
It’s pretty nice, isn’t it?[VAR 0114(0015)]
Is that so...? Well, it’s pretty nice.[VAR 0114(0015)]
They season the food with a heavy hand—which\nthe students here prefer, I suppose. But the sheer\r\nquantity is what’s truly noteworthy.[VAR 0114(0015)]
The mountain of fries you get when you order the\nAcademy Fries nearly made me dance.[VAR 0114(0015)]
If you haven’t tried it for yourself, I would\ndefinitely recommend it.[VAR 0114(0015)]
You know, I didn’t expect you to pay so much\nattention to my ramblings.[VAR 0114(0015)]
You really are a strange one, aren’t you.[VAR 0114(0015)]
Well, that suits me just fine. Maybe you’d even\nbe interested in trading Pokémon with me?[VAR 0114(0015)]
I’ll be putting up a Dudunsparce, but you can\ntrade whatever Pokémon you feel like.[VAR 0114(0015)]
[VAR BD06(0000)][VAR 1303(0001,0000)][VAR 0101(0001)]... Interesting. This will be\nfun\r\nto\r\nraise.\r\nThank you for the trade.[VAR 0114(0015)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Do you want to trade your [VAR 0101(0001)] for\nmy\r\nDudunsparce?[VAR 0114(0015)]
You can’t trade Larry a Pokémon if you aren’t its\noriginal Trainer!
You can’t trade Larry such a rare Pokémon!
You can’t trade Larry a Shiny Pokémon!
Ah, but no. I don’t think trading is a good idea if\nyou’ve only got one Pokémon in your party...\c\nBetter to cut risks and trade when you have at\nleast two.[VAR 0114(0015)]
All right, then... Maybe another time when our\nschedules align.[VAR 0114(0015)]
Are you interested in resuming our trade talk?[VAR 0114(0015)]
You have a certain look—a look that says you\nwant to battle me.[VAR 0114(0015)]
Ah. My mistake, I suppose. Apologies.[VAR 0114(0015)]
I’m technically off the clock now, but...fine.\nLet’s have a battle.[VAR 0114(0015)]
[~ 55]
Impressive skills...[VAR 0114(0015)]
You just keep getting stronger, don’t you?[VAR 0114(0015)]
I imagine you worked up a sweat. Here, take\nthese.[VAR 0114(0015)]
It’s important to replenish your minerals.[VAR 0114(0015)]
[~ 55]
Here, I’ll give you a reward, so...think we can call\nit a day?[VAR 0114(0015)]
Now then, if you’ll excuse me...[VAR 0114(0015)]
Even you stumble sometimes, I see. Well, for\nwhat it’s worth...a lot can happen in life.[VAR 0114(0015)]
I admit, I think I did a good job coming up with\nMedali’s Gym Test.\c\nHaving the challengers battle each other is a\ngreat way to whittle down their numbers.[VAR 0114(0015)]
I hope La Primera isn’t giving you too much\ntrouble.\c\nTake it from me—you need to say no to her if you\ndon’t want to do something. Otherwise you’ll run\r\nyourself into the ground.[VAR 0114(0015)]
I think the real problem with the Elite Trial is that\nHassel is the one after me. Rika or Poppy would\r\nhear me just fine, even if I didn’t shout.[VAR 0114(0015)]
[VAR BD06(0000)][VAR 0101(0001)] appears to be doing\nwell—and\r\nI\r\ndon’t\r\nthink\r\nit’s\r\nusing\r\nFacade.[VAR 0114(0015)]
How’s the Dudunsparce I traded you?\c\nHis Tera Type is Flying, so I suppose you could\ncall him a “Dudunspairce”...\c\n... ... ...\c\n...Ahem.[VAR 0114(0015)]
The boss contacted me the other day...\c\nShe said you’d given my name when asked about\nyour favorite Gym Leader.\c\nI really don’t understand your choice. Why would\nyou pick an average Joe like me?\c\nMaybe you’re overworked and it’s affecting your\njudgment...? I know a good park where you could\r\ngo to unwind, if that’s the case.[VAR 0114(0015)]

Welcome to Kitakami Hall! Not long now before\nthe big festival starts again!
Snorlax is known as the Sleeping Pokémon, eh?\nPretty clear where that category comes from!
We’ve got a real fun game in the works for you.\nCome on by once the Festival of Masks starts!
Good kids, bad kids, kids at heart—Kitakami Hall\nwelcomes one and all to the Festival of Masks!
I just saw someone run upstairs wearing a Loyal\nThree costume. They must be sweltering in there!
Wait, so that thing I saw before really WAS one\nof the Loyal Three? I knew I should’ve filmed it!
I want to buy a mask, but no one’s at the stall!
They opened the stall back up! I should be able\nto buy a mask now.
So many masks! Which one should I choose?
With a Pikachu mask, you’ll have a pika-pika day!
Fanning cools me down, but flapping my arm like\nthis makes me hot and sweaty all over again...
Every year, masks of the Loyal Three are the first\nthings to fly off the shelves!
Is it true that the Loyal Three came back to life?\c\nMaybe if I wear one of their masks, get close to\nthem—even get to know them...
The real Fezandipiti wasn’t as pink as I thought it\nwould be... What’s the OPPOSITE of serendipity?
Munkidori’s mask is so awesome and blue!
Wait, the Loyal Three really exist? All this time I\nthought it was just an old folktale...
The real Munkidori’s blue coloring was so...sickly.\nI hope it’s feeling hunky-dory...
When I put on a mask, I feel like I’ve become an\nentirely different me!
I always thought the ogre was nothing more than\na tall tale the adults spun up to make kids listen!
Okidogi was a bad guy? That’s not okeydokey\nat all!
That human depicted on the old signboards...\nI wonder if that’s the Loyal Three’s Trainer.
Step right on up for a round of Ogre Oustin’!\nHave a go and win some wonderful prizes!
You’ll need to ride a Pokémon if you want to\nhave a go at Ogre Oustin’!\c\nBut don’t worry—we’ve got a Stantler right here\nfor folks without a ridable Pokémon of their own!

Osu, new kid![VAR 0114(0024)]
Have you come out here to the schoolyard for\nsome training?![VAR 0114(0024)]
Aha! I knew I could see a fighting spirit burning\nbehind those eyes of yours![VAR 0114(0024)]
Ah! Sorry. That was a little rude of me to ask.\nI know the point of training isn’t to show off in\r\nfront of other people.[VAR 0114(0024)]
Why don’t we do a bit of running together here\nto get to know each other a little better?[VAR 0114(0024)]
Ready? Let’s go![VAR 0114(0024)]
You ran three laps around the schoolyard with\nMs. Dendra...
Phew! That really worked up a nice sweat![VAR 0114(0024)]
You’ve got a good pair of legs on ya, new kid![VAR 0114(0024)]
A good bout of training sure does make a body\nhungry, doesn’t it?[VAR 0114(0024)]
I’ll let you have one of my homemade\nsandwiches as my way of saying thanks for\r\nrunning with me today! Feed those muscles![VAR 0114(0024)]
Ms. Dendra’s sandwich was dry and had an odd\nsmell. The taste left much to be desired...
How was it? I hope it was tasty.[VAR 0114(0024)]
Uh, yeah, tasty...
Well, to be honest...
Sorry. I shouldn’t have asked you that. Heh...[VAR 0114(0024)]
I’m athletic and all, but I don’t know the first\nthing about making good food...[VAR 0114(0024)]
as your honest reaction just reminded me.[VAR 0114(0024)]
Well, uh...see you later. Enjoy your sore muscles\ntomorrow.[VAR 0114(0024)]
You became slightly closer with Ms. Dendra!

Text File : kizuna_battle_b

Osu, new kid![VAR 0114(0024)]
Fancy meeting you here in the home economics\nclassroom! What a coincidence, eh?[VAR 0114(0024)]
Likewise!
What brings you here?
So, uh...well, y’see...[VAR 0114(0024)]
Ms. Dendra tells me she is here for intensive\ntraining in sandwich making.[VAR 0114(0029)]
Aww. Well, no use hiding it now...[VAR 0114(0024)]
Oh dear. I’m terribly sorry. Were you keeping this\na secret?[VAR 0114(0029)]
Well, I mean, not really...but it just doesn’t look\nvery cool to openly admit I’m here for “intensive\r\ntraining.” Y’know?[VAR 0114(0024)]
Understood. I will be more careful in the future.[VAR 0114(0029)]
Well, new kid, now that you know what I’m\nup to...[VAR 0114(0024)]
I guess you’ll just have to help me out with my\ntraining here![VAR 0114(0024)]
Try this sandwich! It’s the result of my training\nso far.[VAR 0114(0024)]
Ms. Dendra’s sandwich was soggy and hard to\neat. And, once again, the taste left much to be\r\ndesired...
That was my meat lover’s prosciutto, bacon, and\nchorizo sandwich! How was it?[VAR 0114(0024)]
It was, uh, a little meat heavy...
It could have used some more veggies...
What?! You mean there was a problem with my\nchoice of filling?[VAR 0114(0024)]
I guess focusing on muscle-building ingredients\nreally did a number on the flavor, huh...[VAR 0114(0024)]
Ms. Dendra, I believe a simple addition of butter\nwould have done wonders for your sandwich.[VAR 0114(0029)]
Butter helps to protect the bread from getting\nsoggy due to the moisture of the ingredients.\r\nIt can also work to enhance the sandwich’s flavor.[VAR 0114(0029)]
Butter! That makes sense! Thank you for teaching\nme that tip, Mr. Saguaro![VAR 0114(0024)]
But why didn’t you tell me that while I was\nmaking the sandwich?[VAR 0114(0024)]
Ah...well, you see...when I saw you, I had not\nrealized you had begun your, ahem, food prep.\c\nI thought you were simply trying to destroy\nmy classroom.[VAR 0114(0029)]
... ... ...[VAR 0114(0024)]
Well, anyway![VAR 0114(0024)]
New kid! Thanks to you and Mr. Saguaro here,\nI may finally be getting the hang of this![VAR 0114(0024)]
Thanks for your advice![VAR 0114(0024)]
You became even closer with Ms. Dendra!

C’mon, Miriam! Just try it![VAR 0114(0024)]
Ms. Dendra!
What’s wrong?
Oh! Great timing, new kid![VAR 0114(0024)]
Nurse Miriam here won’t try the sandwich I made![VAR 0114(0024)]
Well, DUH! I don’t want to get a stomachache![VAR 0114(0028)]
You won’t! Probably![VAR 0114(0024)]
Uh, I still remember that “sandwich” you made\nme with meat filling and meat for bread.\r\nThat one really messed me up bad.[VAR 0114(0028)]
I hadn’t trained in the art of sandwich making yet\nback then! I was young and thoughtless and—[VAR 0114(0024)]
“Young and thoughtless”? It was LAST MONTH![VAR 0114(0028)]
Sooo, as you can see, I’m not getting anywhere\ntrying to persuade her.[VAR 0114(0024)]
Even after I went through that intensive sandwich-\nmaking training! It kinda makes me sad...[VAR 0114(0024)]
She went through intensive sandwich-making\ntraining?[VAR 0114(0028)]
She worked really hard at it!
You should try her sandwich
Ugh...[VAR 0114(0028)]
I guess I have no choice if you’ve got one of our\ncute little students on your side.[VAR 0114(0028)]
So, fine. I’ll try your sandwich. Let’s see it.[VAR 0114(0028)]
Yesss! I knew you’d come around. Here it is...[VAR 0114(0024)]
*munch munch munch*[VAR 0114(0028)]
It’s a little strongly flavored, but...I guess it’s\nnot bad?[VAR 0114(0028)]
Woo-hoo! My training paid off![VAR 0114(0024)]
I’m so glad my sandwich pleases the great\nNurse Miriam! I look up to you, you know![VAR 0114(0024)]
You feel trusted by Ms. Dendra!
Thank you for trying it! And thanks to you too,\nnew kid![VAR 0114(0024)]
Aaand she’s run off again. That was weird...[VAR 0114(0028)]
But that’s just how Ms. Dendra is, I guess. She’s\nalways coming into the nurse’s office with some\r\ninjury or another, too.[VAR 0114(0028)]

Osu, new kid! You here to do a little shopping?[VAR 0114(0024)]
Yep! I’m here to shop
I came to see you
The school store’s a nice place! They’ve got\neverything you need right here![VAR 0114(0024)]
Hahaha! So you came to see me, did you?[VAR 0114(0024)]
I’m here to check out the sandwiches they’ve got\nfor sale.[VAR 0114(0024)]
The school store’s sandwiches taste great and\nhave excellent nutritional balance, too![VAR 0114(0024)]
You’re not making your own?
What happened to your intensive training?
Haha. I guess I’m just not used to it yet. All that\ntraining kind of wore me out![VAR 0114(0024)]
I achieved my goal, anyway, so I’m going to take\na break from sandwich making for a bit![VAR 0114(0024)]
Oh, right. I didn’t tell you what my goal was.\c\nI wanted to pay Nurse Miriam back for everything\nshe does for me. It was my way of saying thanks![VAR 0114(0024)]
She’s so nice and so skilled at what she does.\nI really look up to her![VAR 0114(0024)]
I wanted to try sandwich making so I could be\nskilled at doing something for other people, like\r\nshe is, but I guess I just wasn’t cut out for it.[VAR 0114(0024)]
What I am cut out for, though, is being full of\nenergy! So I decided to focus on that instead![VAR 0114(0024)]
Like I said in class, I think people and Pokémon\nshould make their strong points stronger![VAR 0114(0024)]
You really helped me out, new kid! Take this as\nmy way of saying thanks.[VAR 0114(0024)]
All right, then! What should I go with today to\nget my protein in?[VAR 0114(0024)]
You formed a close bond with Ms. Dendra!

I have a question for you. Do you find my class\ndifficult?[VAR 0114(0012)]
A little bit, yeah...
It’s just right for me!
Hmm... Perhaps I need to improve how I convey\nthe material.[VAR 0114(0012)]
That is certainly good to hear.[VAR 0114(0012)]
So, [VAR 0100(0000)]...[VAR 0114(0012)]
You chose to take on the Gyms as part of your\nTreasure Hunt.[VAR 0114(0012)]
That must mean you like Pokémon battles. Is that\ncorrect?[VAR 0114(0012)]
One naturally becomes skilled at doing what they\nenjoy. That must be why you are so strong.[VAR 0114(0012)]
Then you’re attempting to overcome a weakness?\nI applaud your efforts, indeed![VAR 0114(0012)]
Ah, do forgive me for springing such an odd\nquestion upon you so suddenly.[VAR 0114(0012)]
I often find myself pondering the nature of\nstrength these days...[VAR 0114(0012)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Anyway, thank you again for your input,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0012)]
You became slightly closer with Mr. Hassel!

Hello there, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0012)]
I try to visit the schoolyard from time to time.[VAR 0114(0012)]
It’s good to see young ones with so much energy\nand vigor...[VAR 0114(0012)]
You think so?
I know what you mean...
Oh, yes indeed. Just watching is enough to make\neven an old man like me feel more alive.[VAR 0114(0012)]
Do you? That’s a bit of a surprise to hear you say.\nYou’re one of the young ones too, you know.[VAR 0114(0012)]
Master Hassel. Might I have a word?
You... What are you doing here?[VAR 0114(0012)]
I have told you many times not to bother me\nhere at the academy.[VAR 0114(0012)]
Yet, I am bound to come. Our family’s future is of\nparamount importance.
... ... ...[VAR 0114(0012)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]It was good speaking with you,\n[VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0012)]
Something important has come up, so I must\nexcuse myself now.[VAR 0114(0012)]
You became even closer with Mr. Hassel!
Let us discuss this matter elsewhere. Come...[VAR 0114(0012)]

[VAR BD06(0000)]Oh! Why, hello there, young\n[VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0012)]
I’m sorry. I was lost in thought and didn’t notice\nyour approach.[VAR 0114(0012)]
I feel I must again apologize for what transpired\nin the schoolyard...[VAR 0114(0012)]
It didn’t bother me
What’re you talking about?
Hah... That is very magnanimous of you.[VAR 0114(0012)]
I’m of course referring to how I rather suddenly\nhad to take my leave while we were still engaged\r\nin conversation.[VAR 0114(0012)]
That woman who showed up is a Dragon Tamer—\nand a relative of mine, I might add.[VAR 0114(0012)]
You see, I come from a very long line of Trainers\nwho specialize in Dragon-type Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0012)]
There was a child in our family who was expected\nto stand at its head and lead it to greatness.[VAR 0114(0012)]
But the young lad, rebellious little fellow that he\nwas, ran away from home one day.[VAR 0114(0012)]
He made quite the show of it, too, swearing he’d\n“make a living with music”![VAR 0114(0012)]
A lot happened since then, and...now he’s the art\nteacher and Elite Four member before you![VAR 0114(0012)]
After I so rudely took my leave during our last\nconversation, my dear relative...encouraged me\r\nto give up teaching and return home at last.[VAR 0114(0012)]
I’ve been told the current leader of my family—\nthat is to say, my father—is in poor health.[VAR 0114(0012)]
Oh, but I do apologize. Perhaps I am not cut out\nfor teaching after all... What sort of teacher\r\ngrumbles on and on at his own student?[VAR 0114(0012)]
You’re a great teacher!
I don’t want you to quit teaching!
[VAR BD06(0000)]Ah, my dear [VAR 0100(0000)]... You\nhave\r\nno\r\nidea\r\nhow\r\nmuch\r\nyour\r\nwords\r\nmean\r\nto me.[VAR 0114(0012)]
Thank you. Thank you so very much.[VAR 0114(0012)]
You feel trusted by Mr. Hassel!

Why hello there, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0012)]
You always seem to appear at the most crucial\nof moments.[VAR 0114(0012)]
The most crucial of moments?
Is something going on?
Well, you see...[VAR 0114(0012)]
Master Hassel. I am here to collect you.
So I see.[VAR 0114(0012)]
I’m glad that you’ve finally made up your mind\nabout taking your place as leader of the family.
Well...[VAR 0114(0012)]
It is indeed true that I have made up my mind.[VAR 0114(0012)]
I have made up my mind to continue teaching\nhere at the academy![VAR 0114(0012)]
H-how could you?! Are you saying you don’t care\nwhat happens to our proud lineage?!
I am saying that I have other priorities![VAR 0114(0012)]
Have a look around at the art decorating this\nroom, would you?[VAR 0114(0012)]
The children here are letting their senses—their\nperceptiveness—grow freely![VAR 0114(0012)]
I do not wish to say that protecting our family’s\nancient bloodline is of no importance...[VAR 0114(0012)]
I simply wish to see young talent blossom and\ngrow into the future.[VAR 0114(0012)]
It just seems so much more fun to me, if I’m\nbeing honest![VAR 0114(0012)]
What utter nonsense.
And yet...
Your fearless, unflinching commitment to that\nnonsensical vision proves that you’re worthy of\r\ncarrying the will of the dragons, Master Hassel.
I will not give up. I will come as many times as I\nneed to in order to change your mind.
Oh, by all means, my door is open! I think you’ll\nsoon find you’ve met your match in stubbornness.[VAR 0114(0012)]
You thought I could be cowed by some story\nspun up about my father’s deteriorating health?\r\nI am not so easily fooled![VAR 0114(0012)]
Tch! I will return another day!
Ah, I’m sorry you had to see all of that.[VAR 0114(0012)]
I was so very close to resigning my post as\nteacher and returning to my home...[VAR 0114(0012)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]but the students here gave me courage to say no.\nThat includes you, [VAR 0100(0000)].\r\nYour\r\nwords\r\ntruly\r\nbrought\r\nme strength.[VAR 0114(0012)]
I cannot think of a way I can possibly repay my\ndebt to you young ones.[VAR 0114(0012)]
Take this, if you will—insufficient as it may be in\nexpressing the full breadth of my gratitude.[VAR 0114(0012)]
Now then! Let it be clear to all![VAR 0114(0012)]
I, Hassel, will continue on my chosen path as\ninstructor to the youths of our world![VAR 0114(0012)]
You formed a close bond with Mr. Hassel!

Man, you sure did give me a beating in that\nAcademy Ace Tournament![VAR 0114(0006)]
Seems like all my closest buddies are in another\nleague, you know?[VAR 0114(0006)]
I mean, look at you—you just up and became\na Champion! In your first year, to boot!\c\nYou know that’s pretty amazing, right?[VAR 0114(0006)]
Then there’s Nemona—top marks in every class\nat school, and she’s Champion-ranked too.[VAR 0114(0006)]
And I hear Penny’s got some kind of offer to\nwork for the Pokémon League or something?![VAR 0114(0006)]
I seem to be the only average one around here.\nNothing special about me...[VAR 0114(0006)]
You’re great at cooking!
Your [VAR 1107(00FF,0303)]momdad’s super famous!
Nah, I mean...it’s just, like, a hobby really.\c\nI only learned how to do the basics because my\n[VAR 1107(00FF,0303)]momdad wasn’t around to cook for me...[VAR 0114(0006)]
Tch! You sure don’t give a guy a break, huh?\c\nSo, the only special thing about me is who my\n[VAR 1107(00FF,0303)]momdad was? Not like I had anything to do with it...[VAR 0114(0006)]
Wait! My [VAR 1107(00FF,0303)]momdad![VAR 0114(0006)]
See, now that Mabosstiff is doing so much better,\nand since the Treasure Hunt is still going and all,\r\nI’ve been thinking of a new goal: to find myself![VAR 0114(0006)]
And I guess you’ve really gotta start by knowing\nwhere you come from, which means...I should\r\nlearn more about my [VAR 1107(00FF,0303)]momdad, right?[VAR 0114(0006)]
She was a student at this school once, too. That’s\nwhat I heard.[VAR 0114(0006)]
He was a student at this school once, too. That’s\nwhat I heard.[VAR 0114(0006)]
I’m gonna search the whole school for info about\nwhat kind of person she really was![VAR 0114(0006)]

Take a look at this![VAR 0114(0006)]
This is supposed to be a sample from my mom’s\nresearch from back when she was a student![VAR 0114(0006)]
This is supposed to be a sample from my dad’s\nresearch from back when he was a student![VAR 0114(0006)]
Hehe, that’s what Director Clavell here told me.\nHe’s been helping me out.[VAR 0114(0006)]
When Sada was a student at this academy, I was\nstill a mere researcher myself.[VAR 0114(000A)]
When Turo was a student at this academy, I was\nstill a mere researcher myself.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Among my peers, it was already being bandied\nabout that an astoundingly gifted young woman\r\nwas studying at Naranja Academy.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Among my peers, it was already being bandied\nabout that an astoundingly gifted young man was\r\nstudying at Uva Academy.[VAR 0114(000A)]
So she really was always amazing...right from the\nstart, huh?[VAR 0114(0006)]
So he really was always amazing...right from the\nstart, huh?[VAR 0114(0006)]
Oh! I guess I never really questioned it, but...\nwhy IS your office full of all this equipment?[VAR 0114(0006)]
Ho! So you’ve finally noticed, have you?[VAR 0114(000A)]
This room was once your mother’s research lab.[VAR 0114(000A)]
This room was once your father’s research lab.[VAR 0114(000A)]
It was?![VAR 0114(0006)]
From what I’ve heard recounted, [VAR 1107(00FF,0001)]she apparently\nwould become so absorbed in h[VAR 1107(00FF,0202)]eris research that\r\n[VAR 1107(00FF,0001)]she hardly ever returned to h[VAR 1107(00FF,0202)]eris dorm room.\c\n[VAR 1107(00FF,0102)]ShHe spent most nights sleeping here, in fact.[VAR 0114(000A)]
I also find myself more at ease surrounded by\nsuch research equipment, so I took the liberty\r\nof adapting the room to serve as my office.[VAR 0114(000A)]
I never knew...[VAR 0114(0006)]
All these pieces of my mom’s life—they were\nright in front of me this whole time...[VAR 0114(0006)]
All these pieces of my dad’s life—they were\nright in front of me this whole time...[VAR 0114(0006)]
I spent so long trying not to think about h[VAR 1107(00FF,0202)]erim\nthat I never even noticed...until now.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Thanks for telling me about this, Director Clavell![VAR 0114(0006)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]And, [VAR 0100(0000)], thanks for being\nhere\r\nwith\r\nme\r\nto\r\nlearn\r\nabout\r\nit, too![VAR 0114(0006)]
Ah, Master Arven! I also intended to explain\nabout these trophies here—[VAR 0114(000A)]
And he is already gone. Rather hard to pin down,\nisn’t he?\c\nOff like a flash as soon as some new thought\ncrosses his mind.[VAR 0114(000A)]
My dear Sada...[VAR 0114(000A)]

Seriously? You’re already so good at everything\nelse—couldn’t you just slack off a bit? For me?[VAR 0114(0006)]
What, you just felt like climbing all those stairs\nto train your legs or something?[VAR 0114(0006)]
Oh, you wanna know why I’m here?\c\nUh...yeah. I’m still working on my own little\nTreasure Hunt—trying to find myself and all.[VAR 0114(0006)]

This book was so precious to my dad that he\neven kept a copy of it in the lighthouse lab...\r\nThe Violet Book... That’s what it’s called, right?[VAR 0114(0006)]
This is my first time really reading the bits that\naren’t about the Herba Mystica—they’re amazing![VAR 0114(0006)]
I mean, it all sounds super fake, but it’s got all\nthese cool pictures and it’s real fun to read![VAR 0114(0006)]
Like, look at this entry here![VAR 0114(0006)]
The text on this page is all smudged and blurry in\nevery copy of this book I’ve ever seen.\c\nSeems kinda suspicious, right?[VAR 0114(0006)]
’Course, the whole book is full of unbelievable\nstories, the Herba Mystica being one of them.\r\nBut they turned out to be real...\c\nAnd after everything we saw in Area Zero—well,\nmakes it hard to say it’s all nonsense, huh?[VAR 0114(0006)]
In fact, I think it might’ve been this book that\nmade my mom want to become a researcher.[VAR 0114(0006)]
In fact, I think it might’ve been this book that\nmade my dad want to become a researcher.[VAR 0114(0006)]

I bet he got so fixated with the future Pokémon\nhe read about in here that it made him want to\r\nsee one for himself.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Wait, hold on... Isn’t my mom’s time machine the\nwhole reason the ancient Pokémon ended up here\r\nin the first place?[VAR 0114(0006)]
Wait, hold on... Isn’t my dad’s time machine the\nwhole reason the future Pokémon ended up here\r\nin the first place?[VAR 0114(0006)]

But I’m at a pretty good stopping point. How\nabout a break? I could use a change of scenery.[VAR 0114(0006)]
What do you think? Welcome to Chez Arven!\nWell, Chez Arven and Mabosstiff, really.[VAR 0114(0006)]

Why’s that surprising?! I’ll have you know that I\nclean every single day!\c\nMostly ’cause Mabosstiff sheds a ton, but still...[VAR 0114(0006)]
Anyway, uh... About the reason you saw me\nstudying in the classroom like that...[VAR 0114(0006)]
I went back and read the pages about the Herba\nMystica in the Scarlet Book again.[VAR 0114(0006)]
I went back and read the pages about the Herba\nMystica in the Violet Book again.[VAR 0114(0006)]

I couldn’t seem to do anything to help him, and...\nboy, it sure didn’t feel good.[VAR 0114(0006)]
’Course, I’m really glad that I was able to find\nall the Herba Mystica together with you.[VAR 0114(0006)]
But there’s got to be other people who are still\nsuffering the same way I was back then, worrying\r\nabout their Pokémon that’re sick or hurt.[VAR 0114(0006)]
So... So I...I, uh...\c\nDon’t laugh, OK?[VAR 0114(0006)]
I’ve decided that I...I’m gonna become a cook![VAR 0114(0006)]
I’m gonna make super healthy food, bursting\nfull of the stuff Pokémon need to feel great![VAR 0114(0006)]
I’ll be behind you all the way!
I’m sure you can pull it off!
Yeah! And thanks. I knew I could count on you\nto be all supportive like that.[VAR 0114(0006)]
The culinary world might be a bit different, but\nI swear—I’m gonna be just as famous as my mom![VAR 0114(0006)]

Y’know, there’s something I’ve been thinking\nabout for a while and...I think I made up my mind.[VAR 0114(0043)]
I’ll fill you in soon, I promise. Just wait a bit, OK?[VAR 0114(0043)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Hey, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nGuess\r\nwhat\r\nI\r\ndid?!\r\nI\r\nhad\r\nthe\r\nBB\r\nLeague\r\ndrop me![VAR 0114(0043)]
Wait, why’d you do that?!
Did you get sick of it?
Don’t worry, it’s not ’cause of you—or anybody\nin the club.[VAR 0114(0043)]
I just wanted to become as strong as you so\nbadly... It was all I cared about. Up till now, I’d\r\nforgotten that battling is supposed to be fun.[VAR 0114(0043)]
So I wanna do some thinking about what I really\nwanna do.[VAR 0114(0043)]
I think for now I wanna just be around friends and\nPokémon and not get so caught up in competing.[VAR 0114(0043)]
Guess you thought it through!
Do what you gotta do!
Heh... Thanks.[VAR 0114(0043)]
Only thing that’s changed is that you’re the\nChampion now—the Elite Four lineup is still\r\nthe same. Crispin’s pretty relieved.[VAR 0114(0043)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]But just because you got to the top doesn’t mean\nyou get to slack off, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0043)]
Once I’ve cleared my head a bit, I’m gonna\nshoot for that Champion title again![VAR 0114(0043)]
Looking forward to it!
You still won’t beat me!
Hehehe... Yeah, so am I![VAR 0114(0043)]
Hehehe... If you say so![VAR 0114(0043)]
Ah, right—I do have a favor I wanna ask you...[VAR 0114(0043)]
If it’s all right, do you wanna, um...[VAR 0114(0043)]
Do you wanna trade Pokémon with me?[VAR 0114(0043)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Woo-hoo! I’ll trade my Applin! What about you,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0043)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]I’ll take real good care of your [VAR 0101(0001)],\n[VAR 0100(0000)],\r\ndon’t\r\nyou\r\nworry!\r\nThanks\r\nfor\r\ntrading\r\nwith me![VAR 0114(0043)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]OK, so you wanna trade your [VAR 0101(0001)]\nfor\r\nmy\r\nApplin?[VAR 0114(0043)]
You can’t trade Kieran a Pokémon if you aren’t its\noriginal Trainer!
You can’t trade Kieran such a rare Pokémon!
You can’t trade Kieran a Shiny Pokémon!
Wait, we can’t trade if you’ve only got one li’l\nPokémon on your team.\c\nLet’s trade once you have at least two, OK?[VAR 0114(0043)]
Aw, man... OK, then...[VAR 0114(0043)]
Do you wanna trade Pokémon with me?[VAR 0114(0043)]
Hey, [VAR 0100(0000)]! Let’s battle![VAR 0114(0043)]
Oh, OK... Yeah, no worries![VAR 0114(0043)]
All right! Let’s head over to the entrance, then![VAR 0114(0043)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Ah, sorry, [VAR 0100(0000)]...\nI\r\nwas\r\nthinkin’\r\nwe’d\r\ndo\r\na\r\nDouble\r\nBattle,\r\nactually.\r\nCould\r\nyou\r\nbring\r\nat\r\nleast\r\ntwo Pokémon?[VAR 0114(0043)]
Hehehe, that was fun![VAR 0114(0043)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]See, this is exactly why I look up to you,\n[VAR 0100(0000)].\r\nYou\r\nsure\r\nare strong![VAR 0114(0043)]
I wish there was something I could give you...\nOh, I know![VAR 0114(0043)]
I don’t have my own smartphone yet, so you can\nhave that![VAR 0114(0043)]
You received a [VAR FF00(0008)]Blueberry Case (Black) [VAR FF00(0000)]from\nKieran!
[VAR BD06(0000)]Today sure was fun! Thanks,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0043)]
We gotta battle again sometime![VAR 0114(0043)]
Wowzers, I managed to beat you! Oh man, my\nheart’s still poundin’...\c\nThanks for the battle, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0043)]
Is the ogre—I mean, Ogerpon—doin’ well?\c\nI think...it’ll be pretty happy as long as it’s with\nyou.[VAR 0114(0043)]
Man, my room is a real disaster right now...\c\nIt’s still how I left it when I was all obsessed with\nbattlin’... I should hurry up and clean it...[VAR 0114(0043)]
I grew up in Kitakami, so I don’t talk like the\nother kids here...\c\nIt used to bother me, but I don’t mind so much\nanymore![VAR 0114(0043)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Wowzers, you sure I can keep your\n[VAR 0101(0001)],\r\n[VAR 0100(0000)]?!\r\nIt’s\r\na\r\nbeauty!\r\nI’ll\r\ntake\r\nreal\r\ngood\r\ncare\r\nof\r\nit,\r\ndon’t\r\nyou worry![VAR 0114(0043)]
How’s the Applin I traded you? Have you had\nhim on your team?\c\nIt’d sure make me happy to hear he’s helping you\nout in your battles![VAR 0114(0043)]

So this is the clubroom where this academy’s\nmost skilled Trainers gather...[VAR 0114(0011)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Thank you for your...kind invitation, Champion\n[VAR 0100(0000)]. It’s an\r\nhonor\r\nto\r\nbe here.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Unfortunately, I do not have too much time. Let\nus put it to good use together.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Thank you for coming
I take it you’re busy?
[VAR BD06(0000)]Busy or not, refusing an invitation from you was\nout of the question, Champion\r\n[VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0011)]
Do not worry too much, though—I had business\nwith the Unova Pokémon League, as well as some\r\nmatters to address with Director Cyrano.[VAR 0114(0011)]
This is also an excellent opportunity to recruit\nnew, young talent to come to Paldea.[VAR 0114(0011)]
With all that in mind, your invitation actually\ncame at quite an opportune moment.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Ah, by the way... Ms. Briar informed me that your\npresence was invaluable for her expedition to the\r\nArea Zero Underdepths.[VAR 0114(0011)]
This clubroom is a little too...public to discuss the\nmatter here, but please give me the details later.[VAR 0114(0011)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Good day to you, Champion\n[VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0011)]
I was just musing about potentially recruiting new\ntalent...[VAR 0114(0011)]
I would very much appreciate your input.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Could you perhaps recommend a Trainer from\nBlueberry Academy whose talent you felt to be\r\nnoteworthy?[VAR 0114(0011)]
Kieran
Carmine
Crispin
Amarys
Lacey
Drayton
Ah, yes, Kieran! The former Champion of the\nBB League!\c\nHe was also part of the expedition to the\nunderdepths, if I am not mistaken.\c\nHe certainly has talent...and strong ties to you.\nPerhaps we can convince him to move to Paldea.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Ah, yes, Carmine! She was part of the expedition\nto the underdepths, wasn’t she?\c\nShe has also accompanied Ms. Briar on other\nextracurricular excursions. Such experience is\r\nof great value.\c\nAnd she has strong ties to you... We may be able\nto convince her to move to Paldea.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Ah, yes, Crispin! One of the BB League’s Elite\nFour, if I am not mistaken.\c\nWe have no Fire-type users in our Pokémon\nLeague, so he would certainly be a breath of\r\nfresh air.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Ah, yes, Amarys! One of the BB League’s Elite\nFour, if I am not mistaken.\c\nShe is a Steel-type user, correct? I suppose she\nwould get along well with Poppy.\c\nAnd her level-headed and intricate strategies\ncould shine well in Paldea...[VAR 0114(0011)]
Ah, yes, Lacey! One of the BB League’s Elite\nFour, if I am not mistaken.\c\nI hear her father is actually a Gym Leader in the\nUnova region...\c\nWe also have a distinct lack of Fairy-type users\nin our Pokémon League. I would very much like to\r\nspeak with her.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Ah, yes, Drayton! One of the BB League’s Elite\nFour, if I am not mistaken.\c\nI hear his grandfather is a Gym Leader in the\nUnova region...\c\nAnd Drayton was the reigning Champion of the\nBB League until Kieran dethroned him... A Trainer\r\nof uncommon talent indeed.[VAR 0114(0011)]
I had gathered information using my own sources,\nof course...[VAR 0114(0011)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]But your input is much appreciated, Champion\n[VAR 0100(0000)].\r\nIt\r\nwas\r\nmost informative.[VAR 0114(0011)]
If I may, Champion [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0011)]
I can’t help but notice that you seem to often be\nhere at Blueberry Academy in recent days...[VAR 0114(0011)]
Please forgive me if I am being paranoid, but...\c\nyou are not considering moving here to Unova\nfrom Paldea, are you?[VAR 0114(0011)]
I’m staying in Paldea
Unova’s not bad...
Ah, that is a relief to hear. I hope you’ll continue\nto be an inspiration to the people of our region.[VAR 0114(0011)]
I will, of course, respect your decision...\c\nBut personally, I very much hope you will stay in\nPaldea and be an inspiration to the people there.[VAR 0114(0011)]
You are a guiding light that shines upon all of\nPaldea, after all...[VAR 0114(0011)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]I have a proposition for you, Champion\n[VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0011)]
I want to demonstrate to you just how much I\ndepend on your presence.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Perhaps a Pokémon trade between the two of us\nwould help?[VAR 0114(0011)]
I will be trading a Glimmet I caught in Area Zero.\c\nI hope through this trade you can somehow show\nme what you truly feel.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Thank you for trading with me.\c\nI am very curious to see how you raised this\n[VAR 0101(0001)] of yours...[VAR 0114(0011)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]You will trade your [VAR 0101(0001)]\nfor\r\nmy\r\nGlimmet, then?[VAR 0114(0011)]
You can’t trade Geeta a Pokémon if you aren’t\nits original Trainer!
You can’t trade Geeta such a rare Pokémon!
You can’t trade Geeta a Shiny Pokémon!
Ah, but you seem to only have one Pokémon\nwith you.\c\nPlease come back to me once you have at least\ntwo Pokémon on your team.[VAR 0114(0011)]
I understand. You need to think carefully about\nwhich Pokémon to trade with me. I eagerly await\r\nyour decision.[VAR 0114(0011)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Are you ready to trade Pokémon, Champion\n[VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0011)]
If you have a moment, would you care to battle\nme, Champion [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0011)]
Ah, that’s unfortunate. I am ready for a match\nwhenever the mood strikes you.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Wonderful! Let us make our way over to the\nacademy’s entrance, then.[VAR 0114(0011)]
[~ 66]
...Magnificent as always. I see you’ve continued\nto hone your skills.[VAR 0114(0011)]
That settles it for me. I no longer have any\ndoubts about my decision.[VAR 0114(0011)]
There is something I very much wish for you\nto have.[VAR 0114(0011)]
I hope you think carefully about why I chose to\ngive you those...[VAR 0114(0011)]
You received the [VAR FF00(0008)]Elite Gloves [VAR FF00(0000)]from Geeta!
Another wonderful battle. Please, take this—\njust something for your time.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Regarding the gloves I gave you... Take your time\nto consider, but know that I await your reply.[VAR 0114(0011)]
An unusual slip-up for one of your talent.\c\nI do hope you manage to defeat me next time![VAR 0114(0011)]
A club emulating the organization and activities\nof a Pokémon League—such an interesting idea.\c\nI’ll be sure to discuss with Director Clavell and\nsee if we can’t begin something similar in Paldea.[VAR 0114(0011)]
I have been to the Zero Lab a few times myself...\c\nbut it never occurred to me to insert the Indigo\nDisk into the panel by the entrance. You certainly\r\nare good at thinking outside the box![VAR 0114(0011)]
The entrance to Blueberry Academy is so\noriginal. It truly is a sight to behold.\c\nAh, I don’t mean to suggest our own academy’s\nentrance is inferior, of course.[VAR 0114(0011)]
About that [VAR 0101(0001)] you traded me...\c\nIt shows remarkable potential. I suppose it takes\nafter you, Champion [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0011)]
I hope you are raising that Glimmet I traded you.\nI am certain she will serve you well.[VAR 0114(0011)]

Have you gotten used to things here at the\nacademy, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(002A)]

I’m, uh, hehe...I’m the one who made it,\nyou know.[VAR 0114(002A)]
Every time someone using the app catches a\nPokémon, that data gets sent to me.\c\nIt’s really helping with my Pokémon research![VAR 0114(002A)]
So be sure to catch any new Pokémon you find\nand work on filling in your Pokédex.[VAR 0114(002A)]

Ah...sorry about that. I got a little excited there.[VAR 0114(002A)]
But I get the feeling that you’re going to be a\ngreat help in my Pokémon research.[VAR 0114(002A)]

You sure are good at catching Pokémon, aren’t\nyou, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(002A)]
For your next goal, let’s aim for 100 species![VAR 0114(002A)]

I reconfigured your Pokédex app so that you may\nview your diploma there anytime you like.[VAR 0114(000A)]

But anyway, you sure did great with the Pokédex,\n[VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(002A)]
If completing the Pokédex was one of the\ntreasures you were after, then I’d say you’ve had\r\na resounding success on your Treasure Hunt![VAR 0114(002A)]
Quite right, Mr. Jacq. A fitting comment indeed.\nIf rather surprising coming from you.[VAR 0114(000A)]

The way you conduct yourself in my class and\nthe answers you give to my questions...[VAR 0114(0027)]
I admit they pique my interest. You are quite the\ninteresting pupil, I must say.[VAR 0114(0027)]

I like new stuff
I prefer older things
You would answer “new stuff” to me, your history\nteacher? Ha! You really are a curious one.[VAR 0114(0027)]
Ah. So you prefer the things of the past, do you?\nThe potential I saw in you was real after all.[VAR 0114(0027)]
Yes, this one may indeed be of good use to\nme someday...[VAR 0114(0027)]
Ah, you can disregard that. I was simply thinking\nout loud.[VAR 0114(0027)]

Are you perhaps interested in the rest of the old\ntale I told you in class?[VAR 0114(0027)]
Heh. It is...convenient that you would take the\nbait I presented in class.[VAR 0114(0027)]
Don’t lie to me. Your desire to fulfill your\nintellectual curiosity is made plain as day by that\r\nlook on your face.[VAR 0114(0027)]
A vessel, a sword, a set of tablets, and a set of\nbeads... After obtaining these four treasures, the\r\nking’s castle was destroyed. Why, you ask?[VAR 0114(0027)]
Because these four treasures were actually\nfour Pokémon![VAR 0114(0027)]
As these Pokémon were passed from human hand\nto human hand as treasures, they slowly became\r\ntainted by hubris and greed.[VAR 0114(0027)]
Finally, after coming in contact with the rapacity\nof the king at that time, they awakened as\r\ndisasters and began to rampage out of control.[VAR 0114(0027)]
The king called for renowned Pokémon wielders\nto defend the country and, after a fierce battle,\r\nthese incarnations of disaster were quelled.[VAR 0114(0027)]
It is said that these four Pokémon were then\nsealed away somewhere in Paldea.[VAR 0114(0027)]
So, what do you think? Would you say this story\nis just make-believe?[VAR 0114(0027)]
What?! Where’s your sense of adventure?[VAR 0114(0027)]
Heh...very astute of you.[VAR 0114(0027)]
I have read many historical disaster reports,\npersonal journals, and the like.\c\nThere is much to support the truth of this story.[VAR 0114(0027)]

And I stumbled upon the truth in the newspaper,\nof all places! Hah! In an interview piece with a\r\ncarpenter, no less![VAR 0114(0027)]
The Pokémon wielders apparently used sacred\nstakes to seal these treasures of ruin in shrines.[VAR 0114(0027)]
There is a separate shrine for each of the four\nPokémon, and eight stakes driven into the ground\r\nin the areas surrounding each shrine keep the\r\npower of ruin at bay.[VAR 0114(0027)]
In other words, if all of the stakes for a given\nshrine were to be removed...[VAR 0114(0027)]
it would release the Pokémon held inside![VAR 0114(0027)]
Don’t you think it would be nice to free those\nPokémon from the confines of their tiny little\r\nshrines, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0027)]
Heh. A kind soul, I see. You are proving\ntruly useful![VAR 0114(0027)]
That’s surprisingly heartless of you! Come now—\ndo it for the Pokémon![VAR 0114(0027)]
According to a descendant of the Pokémon\nwielders in the story, you must have a bond with\r\nPokémon in order to remove the stakes.[VAR 0114(0027)]
I’m sure someone as Pokémon savvy as yourself\nwould have no trouble at all with that.[VAR 0114(0027)]
You can choose for yourself whether to believe\nme or not, but I will mark the locations of these\r\nshrines on your map.[VAR 0114(0027)]
I’d rather go myself, of course, but skipping out\non my classes to go adventuring seems to have\r\nmade the director a little suspicious of me...[VAR 0114(0027)]
Heh. You can think of it as part of your Treasure\nHunt. Treasures of ruin are still treasures, after all.\c\nI hope you will investigate these shrines if you are\nat all inclined to do so.[VAR 0114(0027)]
You feel trusted by Ms. Raifort!

[VAR BD06(0000)][VAR 0100(0000)]! Did you find any of\nthe\r\ntreasures\r\nof ruin?[VAR 0114(0027)]
I hope you will investigate the shrines if you are\nat all inclined to do so.[VAR 0114(0027)]
Hm? It seems to me that you don’t have anything\nnew to report on the treasures of ruin...[VAR 0114(0027)]
Oh! You caught Ting-Lu, the Vessel of Ruin?[VAR 0114(0027)]
Oh! You caught Chien-Pao, the Sword of Ruin?[VAR 0114(0027)]
Oh! You caught Wo-Chien, the Tablets of Ruin?[VAR 0114(0027)]
Oh! You caught Chi-Yu, the Beads of Ruin?[VAR 0114(0027)]
Ohohooo! How interesting! I simply cannot keep\nmy curiosity under control![VAR 0114(0027)]
Judging by its shape and size, this vessel was\nalmost certainly NOT for everyday use.[VAR 0114(0027)]
Perhaps it was a work of art? Or, better yet, a\nritual artifact housing some sort of deity?![VAR 0114(0027)]
I feel that there must be some meaning behind\nthe horns and the designs resembling eyes.[VAR 0114(0027)]
Could it be that this artifact was fashioned after\nthe deity’s very appearance?![VAR 0114(0027)]
So the sword’s blade and hilt form the Pokémon’s\nleft and right fangs![VAR 0114(0027)]
I wonder if the sword broke when it became a\nPokémon... Or perhaps it was always that way?[VAR 0114(0027)]
No, wait—I cannot imagine the king wanting to\nbuy a broken sword.[VAR 0114(0027)]
Maybe it was some sort of weapon that was\nmeant to be used in this “broken” state?![VAR 0114(0027)]
I’ve never seen so many wooden writing tablets\nstrung together! It must have been an epic tale![VAR 0114(0027)]
Most excavated tablets are tantamount to graffiti\nor simple memos—still valuable tools for learning\r\nabout the past, but nothing like this![VAR 0114(0027)]
I can’t read it, but given the length...it must be\na story, yes! Or perhaps the words of a curse...?[VAR 0114(0027)]
If only the words weren’t faded! How frustrating!\nThese wooden tablets piqued the curiosity of a\r\nking! What might have been written on them?[VAR 0114(0027)]
Beads like these were thought to be sacred and\nthus were worn during religious rituals.[VAR 0114(0027)]
I believe they were most often worn as a single\nbead on the neck like a pendant, but it seems\r\nChi-Yu has four of them.[VAR 0114(0027)]
Were the beads worn in pairs, like on the ears\nand wrists? Or were the rituals perhaps\r\nperformed by four people?[VAR 0114(0027)]
What on earth could have caused beads such as\nthese—originally used to ward off disaster—to\r\nbecome bringers of disaster themselves?[VAR 0114(0027)]
This mystery grows ever deeper. Ah! My thirst\nfor knowledge is slowly being quenched![VAR 0114(0027)]
Hm? You look like you have something more to\nreport. What is it?[VAR 0114(0027)]
Seeing part of history with my own eyes fills me\nwith joy. I thank you, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0027)]
Please come back and report to me again if you\nfind more of the treasures of ruin.[VAR 0114(0027)]
This is simply amazing. You have now reported\nback to me with all four of the treasures of ruin.[VAR 0114(0027)]
I never thought that you would be able to do\nTHIS much for me.[VAR 0114(0027)]
You have my thanks, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0027)]
I would have liked to go looking for the treasures\nof ruin myself and make them my own.[VAR 0114(0027)]
But I suppose it was precisely because I sent\nyou—someone with a pure heart—that we were\r\nable to accomplish this feat.[VAR 0114(0027)]
They may be the treasures of my dreams, but I\nwill allow you to have them for now.[VAR 0114(0027)]
Consider this a symbol of my gratitude, too.\nTake it. It is yours.[VAR 0114(0027)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Heh. You truly are an interesting one, aren’t\nyou, [VAR 0100(0000)]? I hope you\r\ndon’t\r\nmind\r\nif\r\nI\r\ncontinue\r\nto\r\nkeep an eye on you![VAR 0114(0027)]
You formed a close bond with Ms. Raifort!

That’s the first signboard...[VAR 0114(0043)]
S-sorry, did I startle ya?[VAR 0114(0043)]
I-I did mention that I’d hang back an’ follow you\nhere...[VAR 0114(0043)]
We’re s’posed to read the signboard, right?[VAR 0114(0043)]
Oh, I already know the whole story, so...g-go\nahead. You should check it out.[VAR 0114(0043)]
Long, long ago, there was a fearsome ogre in the\nland of Kitakami.
The ogre made its home in the mountain behind\nthe village, frightening all who ventured there.
One day, the ogre came down from the mountain\nin a terrible rage, causing great fear in the village.
By some stroke of luck, Okidogi, Munkidori, and\nFezandipiti all happened to be there as well.
The three Pokémon laid down their lives to fend\noff the ogre and send it back to the mountain.
In admiration, the people of the village bestowed\nupon this brave trio the title “the Loyal Three.”
Their remains were given a proper burial, and\nstatues of the three were erected above the site.
The Loyal Three Monument is right over there...[VAR 0114(0043)]
But don’t you think the ogre in that folktale\nsounds kinda...cool?[VAR 0114(0043)]
Yeah, it sure does!
You think...?
[VAR BD06(0000)]Right?! I knew you’d get it,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nIt was up against three whole opponents at once,\nbattling it out all by itself—wowzers, that’s so cool![VAR 0114(0043)]
C’mon, it was all alone!\c\nThe battle was three against one, but the ogre\nstill managed to hold its own. That’s way cool![VAR 0114(0043)]
Oh... But I guess most people would just think\nan ogre like that is scary, huh? I don’t think\r\nthere’s any reason to be afraid...[VAR 0114(0043)]
When I was little, I went up into the mountain so\nmany times at night—all on my own—an’ I never\r\nonce met that ogre.[VAR 0114(0043)]
Only scary thing that happened was the\ngrown-ups givin’ me a real earful about it...[VAR 0114(0043)]
Umm... So yeah, we’re s’posed to take a photo\nin front of the signboard, right?[VAR 0114(0043)]
I don’t have a smartphone... Could you...?[VAR 0114(0043)]
That turned out great. You’re even good at\ntaking photos...[VAR 0114(0043)]
Thanks!
You wanna try?
S-sorry... Not trying to butter you up or anythin’...[VAR 0114(0043)]

Y’know...I didn’t wanna have to come do this\nwhole school trip thing, but...well...it might\r\nactually be kinda fun...[VAR 0114(0043)]
I get to be out in nature around my hometown...\nand talk to you, [VAR 0100(0000)]...[VAR 0114(0043)]
H-hey, if you want, maybe we could set up a\npicnic. Would you like a sandwich—?[VAR 0114(0043)]
Agia!
Gyah! Wh-what is that thing?! Some kinda...kaiju\nor somethin’?![VAR 0114(0043)]
A “kaiju”? This is Koraidon!
A “kaiju”? This is Miraidon!
This is my ride. It’s called [VAR 1107(00FF,0202)]KoMiraidon!
It’s called Koraidon? And you ride on it, huh...?\nI’ve never seen another Pokémon like this...[VAR 0114(0043)]
It’s called Miraidon? And you ride on it, huh...?\nI’ve never seen another Pokémon like this...[VAR 0114(0043)]
And it seriously comes out whenever it hears\nthe word “sandwich”?[VAR 0114(0043)]

It’s on the grounds of Kitakami Hall.\c\nUm, Kitakami Hall is...\c\nWell, first double back to town from here, then\nthere’s this bridge you cross, and from there,\r\nyou’ll need to climb up the mountainside.\c\nI’ll hang back for now an’ meet you there later![VAR 0114(0043)]

[~ 58]
Now then, let’s read the sign...[VAR 0114(0043)]
The ogre possessed four mysterious, glimmering\nmasks.
It is said that depending on the mask the ogre\ndonned, the powers of its cudgel would change.
When wearing the teal mask, it could bring life\nback into withered greenery around it.
When wearing the crimson mask, it could turn a\ncandle’s flame into a raging inferno.
When wearing the blue mask, it could stop the\nvery flow of a river.
When wearing the ashen gray mask, it could\neasily break the hardest stone in two.
Before the Loyal Three fell, they wrested away\nthree of the ogre’s masks, greatly weakening it.
Did you read it...?[VAR 0114(0043)]
[~ 58]
[~ 58]
[~ 58]
[~ 58]
[~ 58]
The masks the Loyal Three stole are kept over at\nKitakami Hall.[VAR 0114(0043)]
Everyone in town is scared of the ogre...but me?\nI really like it.[VAR 0114(0043)]
It was strong...and cool...and it didn’t even care\nwhen everyone shunned it...\c\nI’ve always wanted to be like that, ever since I\nwas a kid.[VAR 0114(0043)]
I want to be as cool as the ogre.[VAR 0114(0043)]
My sis sorta ends up doin’ everything for me...\neven when we’re at school...[VAR 0114(0043)]
I...wanna try to get stronger. So I can do things\nfor myself, you know?[VAR 0114(0043)]
I’m gonna become someone people can rely on.\nThen, just maybe...I could be that ogre’s friend.[VAR 0114(0043)]
Oh! Um...right. Picture. We’re s’posed to take\na picture![VAR 0114(0043)]
You can take the next one, too, if you don’t mind,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]...[VAR 0114(0043)]
Phew. I knew it was the right call to let you\nhandle it, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0043)]
Now, on to the next signboard...[VAR 0114(0043)]
Oh. And you know the mountain the stories say\nthe ogre lives on? It’s actually Oni Mountain.\r\nYou can climb it from the stairs over there.[VAR 0114(0043)]
If you wanted, we could...go see the ogre’s\nhome? Folks call it the [VAR FF00(0006)]Dreaded Den[VAR FF00(0000)].[VAR 0114(0043)]
I wanna see it!
Hmm, I dunno...
Y-yes! I really...wanted you to see it for yourself,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0043)]
You don’t have to if you don’t wanna...but...\nI’d really like to show you it. You know?[VAR 0114(0043)]
So...if you keep climbing up, you’ll reach the\nInfernal Pass. There’s a sign before that... If you\r\nturn at the sign, you can get to the Dreaded Den.[VAR 0114(0043)]
S-so I’ll just head on up, then. Come along when\nyou’re ready. An’ be careful![VAR 0114(0043)]

Hey, before we check out the sign...could you...\nbattle me...?[VAR 0114(0043)]
Let’s do it!
I dunno...
’K, let me heal up our Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0043)]
I promise I’ll heal up your Pokémon and all, so\nplease, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0043)]
This time...I’ll win![VAR 0114(0043)]
I lost...[VAR 0114(0043)]
It’s because I’m weak... That’s why I...[VAR 0114(0043)]
We should go check out the sign... Come on, let’s\nget this over with.[VAR 0114(0043)]
If you see a shadowy figure approaching you\noutside the village at twilight, be wary.
Don a mask at once, and hide your face.
Do so, and whether the shadow is man or monster,\nyou will pass each other by as fellow mask wearers.
If you should meet the shadow when you have no\nmask in hand, then pray that it is only a man.
If it is, you will live to see another day, and you\nwill remember to never forget your mask again.
But if it is the ogre, you will meet your end, as do\nall humans whose faces are seen by it.
Once it sees your face, your soul will be forfeit.\nAnd you shall never return to the village.
In the old days, everyone carried masks wherever\nthey went. And...the one who made those masks\r\nwas actually my great-great-great-grandpa’s\r\ngreat-great-great-grandpa...or something.[VAR 0114(0043)]
That’s amazing!
So the stories are true?!
I mean, I don’t think any of that stuff about the\nogre stealing souls is true or anything, but...\r\nit is true that our family used to make masks.[VAR 0114(0043)]
Our family...has a long line of mask makers.\nEven my gramps can make ’em.[VAR 0114(0043)]
I even heard that the reason we hold the Festival\nof Masks is ’cause our ancestors came up with\r\nthe idea.[VAR 0114(0043)]
But I don’t really like what they wrote on this\nsign here...[VAR 0114(0043)]
Just because the ogre seemed sorta scary,\neveryone got all afraid of it and drove it away\r\nfrom the village...[VAR 0114(0043)]
But I’m pretty sure the ogre must’ve been lonely\non its own.[VAR 0114(0043)]
Left all alone like that... Treated like some kind\nof outcast...[VAR 0114(0043)]
You’re right
Sorry...
You think so too...huh, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0043)]

Wanna take that last photo?[VAR 0114(0043)]

You’re pretty skilled.[VAR 0114(002C)]
Not many Trainers can shrug off my Pokémon’s\nattacks like that.[VAR 0114(002C)]
The same to you...Eri, was it? Your Pokémon have\nclearly spent a lot of time honing their moves.[VAR 0114(001E)]
But I’m surprised to find the boss herself out here\ndefending the gates.[VAR 0114(001E)]
Don’t you trust your grunts enough to put them\non guard duty?[VAR 0114(001E)]
Watch your mouth.\c\nI’m here because I don’t want to risk anyone else\ngetting hurt, that’s all.[VAR 0114(0022)]
What a benevolent boss. Now, if you want to\nget on with our battle, I’m all ready on my side![VAR 0114(001E)]

Are you OK? You’re not hurt, are you?![VAR 0114(003F)]
I’m fine, honestly! Now get away from here—it’s\nnot safe![VAR 0114(0022)]
I’ll take over guarding the base, Riri! You should\nget back inside![VAR 0114(003F)]
No. I won’t back down... I can’t![VAR 0114(0022)]
Oh, Riri! You need to stop this![VAR 0114(003F)]
Until the big boss comes back, I have to protect\nall of you in the Caph Squad...\c\nAnd everyone else in Team Star, too.[VAR 0114(0022)]
That’s why you should get back to the base and\nrest up—even just for a little bit![VAR 0114(003F)]
As the boss of this squad, I...I just can’t.[VAR 0114(0022)]

Hey, [VAR 0100(0000)]...[VAR 0114(001E)]
My Pokémon and I are actually running on empty\nafter that last battle.[VAR 0114(001E)]
Sorry to spring this on you, but do you think you\ncould handle this grunt alone?[VAR 0114(001E)]
Come on, don’t be like that! It’s not like you to\nhang me out to dry...[VAR 0114(001E)]
Thanks. I’ll be cheering you on from the sidelines![VAR 0114(001E)]
I’ll protect Riri with everything I have. You ready\nto battle?[VAR 0114(003F)]
I’m so ready!
Hold on!
Just hurry up and leave, then! I’m not budging\nan inch from here.[VAR 0114(003F)]
Then here I come![VAR 0114(003F)]
Even if all I did was buy Riri a bit of time,\nthat’s fine.[VAR 0114(003F)]

Before long, the class chose me as their next\ntarget and started bullying me instead.[VAR 0114(003F)]
[~ 68]
I guess I deserved it. But then Riri...she chose to\nhelp me even though I’d been so horrible to her.[VAR 0114(003F)]
She told me that she understood how hard it is\nto have no one on your side...\c\nAnd she invited me into Team Star.[VAR 0114(003F)]
Even after you bullied her like that... What a\nkind girl.[VAR 0114(001E)]
She really is. And joining the team has worked\nout great for us. It’s been so much fun![VAR 0114(003F)]
Fun? There are rumors that Team Star likewise\nengages in bullying...[VAR 0114(001E)]
After hearing my story, do you really think\nthat’s true?[VAR 0114(003F)]
Ah, no... I merely...[VAR 0114(001E)]
Riri and the rest of Team Star made me who I\nam today.[VAR 0114(003F)]

It’s decided, then! I, Salvatore, will just have to\nlend all of the helping hands I have to take care\r\nof Pawmi in this touch-and-go situation![VAR 0114(0026)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Merci very much for your advice,\n[VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0026)]
You became even closer with Mr. Salvatore!
Adios! Au revoir! Farewell![VAR 0114(0026)]

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Oh! My dear [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0026)]
Thanks to your advice from before, Pawmi is...\nWell, just see for yourself![VAR 0114(0026)]
... ... ...
Is it feeling better now?
It seems very...quiet?
Hmm...yeah. It’s feeling better, but this particular\nPawmi may just be a bit meek, I suppose?[VAR 0114(0026)]
I had Nurse Miriam take a look as well, and she\nsays there’s nothing wrong with it healthwise![VAR 0114(002A)]
So it shouldn’t have any injuries, ailments, or\nthe like.[VAR 0114(002A)]
... ... ...
Even so, it never utters so much as a cry, which\nis odd.[VAR 0114(0026)]
That part has even Mr. Jacq here stumped.[VAR 0114(0026)]
Sorry that I couldn’t be of any help...[VAR 0114(002A)]
Ne t’inquiète pas! Don’t worry about it![VAR 0114(0026)]
I have some more information now thanks to the\nacademy’s security cameras, though.[VAR 0114(0026)]
It seems Pawmi was attacked by a wild Pokémon\nand fled here to the academy grounds.[VAR 0114(0026)]
Maybe it’s still in a bit of shock from that\nexperience and can’t bring itself to speak yet?[VAR 0114(0026)]
... ... ...
Yep! If that’s the case, there’s absolutely no\nproblem with keeping quiet! Pas de problème![VAR 0114(0026)]
We can just attendre—wait, that is—until it feels\nlike talking! That’s all we can do, really![VAR 0114(0026)]
Even if you can speak all sorts of languages,\nthere’s no guarantee that you can understand\r\nwhat’s going on in someone’s heart.[VAR 0114(0026)]
But have no fear! I won’t give up! No—I’ll keep\non trying until we’ve figured each other out![VAR 0114(0026)]
You feel trusted by Mr. Salvatore!

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
My dear [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0026)]
Pawmi here is as healthy as can be![VAR 0114(0026)]
... ... ...
Hahaha! Well, it seems being quiet is simply a\npart of this one’s personality![VAR 0114(0026)]
But it’s hard for a Pokémon to communicate with\nits fellows without speaking up.[VAR 0114(0026)]
As you know, wild Pokémon use their cries to tell\neach other all sorts of things—like the location of\r\nfood or whether there are predators nearby.[VAR 0114(0026)]
So even if I were to release it back into the wild,\nI’m afraid that it may not be able to do those\r\nsorts of things![VAR 0114(0026)]
... ... ...
[VAR BD06(0000)]What do you think, [VAR 0100(0000)]?\nWhere\r\ndoes\r\nPawmi belong?[VAR 0114(0026)]
How about here?
With you, Mr. Salvatore!
Here? At the academy?[VAR 0114(0026)]
Oh?! I didn’t expect to hear mon nom—my name![VAR 0114(0026)]
So you think it should stay here...with me![VAR 0114(0026)]
I was so focused on getting it back in good\nhealth so it could return to the wild that I didn’t\r\neven consider that possibility![VAR 0114(0026)]
What do you think about that idea, my little\nPawmi friend?[VAR 0114(0026)]
... ... ...
Pawmi!
Pawmi! It spoke! At last![VAR 0114(0026)]
Even without speaking Pokémon language myself,\nI know that that reply means “yes”![VAR 0114(0026)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Oh, my dear [VAR 0100(0000)]! Merci\nso\r\nvery,\r\nvery\r\nmuch\r\nfor\r\nall\r\nyour\r\nhelp\r\nwith Pawmi![VAR 0114(0026)]
All the more reason you should have this—here,\na rare Pokémon for you to raise![VAR 0114(0026)]
You received a Meowth from Mr. Salvatore!
Ahhh, I’m so happy! Yes—I, Salvatore, will take\nit upon myself to look after Pawmi for good!\r\nI will indeed![VAR 0114(0026)]
You formed a close bond with Mr. Salvatore!

Welcome! Feel free to look around and get\nacquainted with our Elite Four team!
Welcome to the Savanna Plaza! We’re the team\nthat supports Crispin of the Elite Four!
[VAR BD06(0000)]And you’re...[VAR 0100(0000)], right?\nOne\r\nof\r\nthe\r\nBB\r\nLeague\r\nchallengers?
You’ll need to hand over 50 BP if you want\nto take on the Elite Trial here.\c\nAre you ready and willing to pay?
Oh, but...it looks like you don’t have enough BP.\nYou can earn some by taking on BBQs, though!
You paid 50 BP!
Thank you very much! Duly received and noted!
Hey, Crispin! An order’s just come in for you!
Comin’ right up![VAR 0114(0047)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Oh hey, I saw you in the cafeteria! You’re\n[VAR 0100(0000)],\r\nright?!\c\nJust the person to get my energy pumping. I feel\nlike I’m cooking at a nice simmer over here![VAR 0114(0047)]
But we gotta move somewhere else for this\nnext part. Follow me![VAR 0114(0047)]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Text File : sdc02_4kings_a_02
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I’ve been waiting for a fiery challenger like you![VAR 0114(0047)]
Taking on the Elite Four pretty much right after\ncoming to our school? Now that’s lit![VAR 0114(0047)]
No wonder Kieran and Drayton like you.[VAR 0114(0047)]
And if I’m being honest, you’ve kindled my\ncuriosity too![VAR 0114(0047)]
I should warn you, though—my trial is no\ncakewalk![VAR 0114(0047)]
My Elite Trial is...[VAR FF00(0006)]putting together a super-spicy[VAR FF00(0000)]\n[VAR FF00(0006)]sandwich[VAR FF00(0000)]![VAR 0114(0047)]
And I mean SUPER-spicy! I want something so\nhot it’ll have me breathing flames![VAR 0114(0047)]
I know what you’re thinking—that sounds easy,\nright? But you can’t use your own ingredients![VAR 0114(0047)]
You have to [VAR FF00(0006)]negotiate[VAR FF00(0000)] with the League Club\nmembers around here to get what you need![VAR 0114(0047)]
Once you think you have all the right ingredients,\ncome back and talk to me.[VAR 0114(0047)]
Then I’ll judge your sandwich-making skills\nwith my own two eyes![VAR 0114(0047)]
The key to cooking any dish is picking the right\ningredients. The rest is easy as pie![VAR 0114(0047)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Are you ready to take on my Elite Trial,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0047)]
I’m ready!
Explain again?
Maybe later
Sweet! Gimme a hot minute to get everything\nset up![VAR 0114(0047)]
First things first—negotiate with the League\nClub members to get some ingredients.[VAR 0114(0047)]
You need to make a [VAR FF00(0006)]super-spicy sandwich[VAR FF00(0000)]! That\nshould already be a clue for what you need.[VAR 0114(0047)]
Once you’ve got all the ingredients to whip up\nyour sandwich, come gimme a holler![VAR 0114(0047)]
All right then! Let’s start this...now![VAR 0114(0047)]
Do you want mayonnaise? I’ll share some with\nyou, but only if you can defeat me!
I’ll battle you!
No thanks
Oh, it’s may-on now!
Guess you’re not a mayonnaise fan.
Here’s some mayonnaise, like I promised.\nIt’s really good, so...spread the word!
Mayonnaise has a lot of vinegar in it. That’s why\nit’s sour. Sour like life.
Here, let me heal up your Pokémon so there’s\nno sour feelings between us.
[~ 169]
I’ve got some potato salad if you want! You’ll\nhave to beat me in battle to get it, though!
I’ll mash you like a potato!
Aww, no love for potato salad?
My potato salad says it wants to go with you!
There’s something so restorative about carrying\npotato salad around, don’t you think?
Potato salad’s nice because it’s not spicy at all!
[~ 169]
We all know jalapeños are super spicy! And guess\nwhat? I’ve got some!
And I’ll also have you know I’m good at battles.\nLike, really good.
[~ 169]
You look like you want jalapeños, so I’ll give you\na choice. Do you want to battle me for some?\r\nOr buy some off me for 50 BP?
I’ll battle you!
I’ll buy!
I’ll pass on both
Like I said, I’m really strong. I think you might\nregret your decision.
I see you’re a jalapeño-worthy Trainer.
Here, let me heal your Pokémon after all that.
Why battle when you could buy instead, eh?\nI like the way you think.
You don’t have enough BP, though. You can’t\nmake a deal with anybody like that.
A piece of advice—don’t rub your eyes after\nhandling jalapeños.
[~ 169]
Let’s see if you can get this trivia question! If you\ndo, I’ll give you three ingredients!
What do you get when you mix eggs, oil, and\nvinegar? Tell me, if you’ve got it!
[VAR 0109(0001)]
[VAR 0109(0002)]
[VAR 0109(0003)]
[VAR 0109(0004)]
[VAR 0109(0005)]
[VAR 0109(0006)]
[VAR 0109(0007)]
No idea
Correct! The answer is mayonnaise! You’ve got\nfive-star knowledge, I see!
And here’s your prize—three whole ingredients\nat once!
You received a [VAR FF00(0008)]helping of Egg[VAR FF00(0000)], a [VAR FF00(0008)]cruet of[VAR FF00(0000)]\n[VAR FF00(0008)]Olive Oil[VAR FF00(0000)], and a [VAR FF00(0008)]cruet of Vinegar[VAR FF00(0000)]!
Oof! Incorrect! Dunno how you came up with\nan answer like that...
[~ 169]
Oh wow, you don’t have any ingredients at all...
Come back once you’ve gathered some\ningredients!
All three of the ingredients I gave you aren’t\nspicy at all. Isn’t that neat?
You know, it’d be fun if we could all trade\ningredients like we trade Pokémon.
Oh man, I want some eggs. I really, really want\nsome eggs!
If you’ve got any eggs, I’ll trade you something\nthat’ll really broaden your chorizons.
Sure, I’ll trade!
No thanks
Woo-hoo! Way to make the chorrect choice!\nHere you go, chum!
Hey, wait a minute... You don’t have any eggs\nat all!
[~ 169]
Hope you’re putting that chorizo to good use!\nIt has a zing to it, so it’s not for everyone.
I think I bought too much marmalade... And I\nreally don’t need all this mustard, either.
Would you be willing to trade your vinegar for\neither my marmalade or my mustard?
I’ll trade for the marmalade!
I’ll trade for the mustard!
No thanks
Thanks! Here you go!
[~ 169]
[~ 169]
Uh, I don’t think you have any vinegar...
[~ 169]
[~ 169]
[~ 169]
Would you rather have some mustard instead of\nthat marmalade I gave you?
Would you rather have some marmalade instead\nof that mustard I gave you?
Well, if you insist... Here you go!
Well I’m in a fine pickle, I am... I’m missing two\nwhole ingredients!
Listen, I’ll give you a super spicy jalapeño if you\nfront me some prosciutto and olive oil!
Here you go!
No thanks
Yesss! You’ve got a real big heart, you know?
You handed over your Prosciutto and Olive Oil\nand received a [VAR FF00(0008)]helping of Jalapeño[VAR FF00(0000)]!
Errr...sorry friend, but I need both prosciutto\nand olive oil. Not either or. Or neither.
[~ 169]
Why is it that we say kind, generous people have\nbig hearts?
[~ 169]
Man, I’ve got a hankering for some of that\npotatoey stuff that you eat cold, you know?
Wow... You don’t have a single ingredient, huh?
I’d hand over three ingredients for just a bit of it!\nGot any of that potatoey stuff for me?
[~ 169]
Maybe later
Yes, this is it! You won’t believe how much\nI’ve been craving potato salad all day!
Here you go—three ingredients in exchange for\nyour potato salad!
You handed over your Potato Salad and received\nhelpings of [VAR FF00(0008)]Onion[VAR FF00(0000)], [VAR FF00(0008)]Cucumber[VAR FF00(0000)], and [VAR FF00(0008)]Prosciutto[VAR FF00(0000)]!
That’s not very potatoey...
[~ 169]
I know some people put apples in potato salad,\nbut I can’t say I’m a big fan...
[~ 169]
I wonder if anyone has any lovely green\ncucumbers to spare...
How about you? If you have a cucumber, will\nyou trade me for some chili sauce or ketchup?
I’ll trade you for the chili sauce!
I’ll trade you for the ketchup!
No thanks
Wow, you even sliced the cucumber for me?\nThis is perfect! Let’s trade!
[~ 169]
[~ 169]
Um... You don’t have any cucumbers, do you?\nHow sad...
[~ 169]
[~ 169]
[~ 169]
I wouldn’t mind exchanging that chili sauce I gave\nyou for some ketchup, if you’d like?
I wouldn’t mind exchanging that ketchup I gave\nyou for some chili sauce, if you’d like?
Perfect! Let’s trade!
[VAR BD06(0000)]You handed over\n[VAR 1302(0001,0000)][VAR 010A(0001)]\r\nand\r\nreceived\r\n[VAR 1302(0002,0000)][VAR FF00(0008)][VAR 010A(0002)][VAR FF00(0000)]!
You handed over 50 BP and received\n[VAR 1302(0001,0000)][VAR FF00(0008)][VAR 010A(0001)][VAR FF00(0000)]!
[VAR BD06(0000)]You received\n[VAR 1302(0001,0000)][VAR FF00(0008)][VAR 010A(0001)][VAR FF00(0000)]!
Once you’ve got all the ingredients to whip up\nyour sandwich, come gimme a holler![VAR 0114(0047)]
[~ 169]
[~ 169]
Got everything you need? Wanna start making a\nsuper-spicy sandwich?[VAR 0114(0047)]
I want to start!
Maybe not yet...
I can tell you’re cooking on high heat! Looking\nforward to something extra spicy, then.[VAR 0114(0047)]
WHOOO! This isn’t spicy anymore, it’s just PAIN!\nI’m burning up all the way inside![VAR 0114(0047)]
Even the spiciest of souls would love that\nsuper-spicy sandwich![VAR 0114(0047)]
So you know what? I think I can already give\nyou my verdict.[VAR 0114(0047)]
...You pass! That was absolutely perfect! Your\nsandwich brought the heat like nothing else![VAR 0114(0047)]
Even the spiciest of souls would be wowed by\nthat spiciness you just delivered.[VAR 0114(0047)]
I’m a bit surprised you didn’t put bread on top,\nthough. Is that a Paldean thing...?[VAR 0114(0047)]
Anyway, you passed my Elite Trial with flying\ncolors! You made a great super-spicy sandwich![VAR 0114(0047)]
I can tell the spicy souls of the world all agree\nwith me—you put spicy ingredients to good use![VAR 0114(0047)]
Me? I coulda handled something a bit spicier,\nreally, but it was still good![VAR 0114(0047)]
And that means you passed my Elite Trial, no\nproblem at all![VAR 0114(0047)]
I’m gonna enjoy the tingle on my tongue as we\nhead back to the plaza.[VAR 0114(0047)]
You picked the right ingredients but dropping\nthem wasn’t the best move...[VAR 0114(0047)]
This is not enough to wow ol’ Crispin! Sorry, but\nyou gotta try again![VAR 0114(0047)]
It needs just a liiittle bit more heat! Just a pinch\nmore to get a good amount of spice going...[VAR 0114(0047)]
This is not enough to wow ol’ Crispin! Sorry, but\nyou gotta try again![VAR 0114(0047)]
That wasn’t spicy at all... You need to add more\nspicy ingredients!\c\nSeriously, the spicier you can make it, the better![VAR 0114(0047)]
This is not enough to wow ol’ Crispin! Sorry, but\nyou gotta try again![VAR 0114(0047)]
Do you want to give up on this Elite Trial?
Yes
No
You gave up on the Elite Trial!

Good luck with the Elite Trial!

Well, that wraps up the trial, so now it’s time to\nface me in an elite battle![VAR 0114(0047)]
You all prepped and ready to take me on?[VAR 0114(0047)]
Don’t worry, I get it! Battles are like meals—the\nbest ones take the most prep work![VAR 0114(0047)]
Comin’ right up! Watch out, ’cause I’m cranking\nup the heat![VAR 0114(0047)]
Hey, [VAR 0100(0000)]! You all prepped?[VAR 0114(0047)]
Crispin’s Magmortar is in a league of its own!\nWatch out, or it’ll give you a nasty burn!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Text File : sdc02_4kings_a_04
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
So...[VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0047)]
I take it there’s some messy history between you\nand Kieran, huh?[VAR 0114(0047)]
And it sure seems like Drayton’s cookin’ up\nsomething fishy, too...[VAR 0114(0047)]
Gaaah! Everything’s getting so complicated!\nCan’t you all just get over yourselves?![VAR 0114(0047)]
If you wanna say something, just say it! If you\nwanna do something, just do it![VAR 0114(0047)]
I’m not the kinda guy who wastes time sweating\nthe small stuff![VAR 0114(0047)]
I battle because I wanna battle! And you know\nwhat? That’s how it should be![VAR 0114(0047)]
I’m Crispin, the Elite Four rep in this here\nSavanna Biome![VAR 0114(0047)]
I wanna win, so that’s exactly what I’ll do![VAR 0114(0047)]
Wooo! That was amazing! We cranked the heat\nall the way up, eh, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0047)]
I love battles and I love cooking ’cause they’re\nboth so easy to understand![VAR 0114(0047)]
In battles, you either win or you lose! With\ncooking, your dish is either spicy or not spicy!\c\nSimple, right?[VAR 0114(0047)]
But right now, the mood in the League Club\nfeels...I dunno, off. It’s so frustrating...[VAR 0114(0047)]
I wish I knew how we could go back to bein’ the\nfun club we were before...[VAR 0114(0047)]
But hey, didn’t mean to douse the flames there.\nYou were real strong, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0047)]
Lemme see if I can transfer the burning heat\nfrom our battle to my frying pan!\c\nI’ll whip you up something great![VAR 0114(0047)]
Here, I’ll also give you one of my favorite moves\nto serve up in battle.[VAR 0114(0047)]
I’ve got no clue how to manage the temperature\nof anything besides what I’m cooking.[VAR 0114(0047)]
So all I can say is...crank up the heat all you want\nin the BB League, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0047)]
Congratulations on your victory against Crispin\nof the Elite Four!

Welcome! Feel free to look around and get\nacquainted with our Elite Four team!
Welcome to the Canyon Plaza! We’re the team\nthat supports Amarys of the Elite Four!
[VAR BD06(0000)]And you’re...[VAR 0100(0000)], right?\nOne\r\nof\r\nthe\r\nBB\r\nLeague\r\nchallengers?
You’ll need to hand over 50 BP if you want\nto take on the Elite Trial here.\c\nAre you ready and willing to pay?
Oh. You don’t have enough BP, I’m afraid... You\ncan earn some by taking on BBQs, though!
You paid 50 BP!
Thank you very much! Duly received and noted!
Now here she comes—our very own Amarys!
...[VAR 0100(0000)], yes?[VAR 0114(0048)]
As you see, I’m present and ready for your trial.[VAR 0114(0048)]
A change of location is required... Come.[VAR 0114(0048)]

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The decision to allow you to take on the League\nwas irregular. An exception among exceptions...[VAR 0114(0048)]
I was against it, as you know. But the academy\nallowed it, and their ruling is absolute.[VAR 0114(0048)]
Therefore, I will carry out my duty as a member\nof the Elite Four as flawlessly as I always do.[VAR 0114(0048)]
The Elite Trial I devised starts right here.[VAR 0114(0048)]
I call my challenge...the [VAR FF00(0006)]Flying Time Trial[VAR FF00(0000)].[VAR 0114(0048)]
You will need to fly around the skies of the\nTerarium while riding a Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0048)]
Reach the goal within the prescribed time, and\nyou will pass the trial.[VAR 0114(0048)]
Fly through the Magnemite rings, and extra time\nwill be added to the countdown.[VAR 0114(0048)]
I recommend you go through as many rings as\npossible as you fly toward the goal.[VAR 0114(0048)]
Can you verify that you are ready and willing to\ntake on my Flying Time Trial?[VAR 0114(0048)]
I’m ready!
Explain again?
Maybe later
Understood.[VAR 0114(0048)]
I assume you have a Pokémon to ride on. Please\nbring it out of its ball.[VAR 0114(0048)]
Agias!
...Ah, good. With some effort, this Pokémon\nshould be capable of flight.[VAR 0114(0048)]
Your name is Agias, yes? This is for you to eat.[VAR 0114(0048)]

Agiaaas!
Koraidon is brimming with power!
Miraidon is brimming with power!
What your Agias just consumed is a supplement\nthat enhances a Pokémon’s flight capabilities.[VAR 0114(0048)]
I prepared it using the leaves of a mysterious\nplant that was found growing in the Terarium.[VAR 0114(0048)]
Your Agias will be able to soar through the skies\nas it pleases—but only for the duration of the trial.[VAR 0114(0048)]
You have all you need to begin the challenge.\nI wish you luck.[VAR 0114(0048)]
That was an impressive display of punctuality.\nI must admit, it was satisfying to watch you fly.[VAR 0114(0048)]
Congratulations. You have cleared my Elite Trial.[VAR 0114(0048)]
Now, a change of location is required once again.\nCome.[VAR 0114(0048)]
It seems this attempt was a failure.\c\nThose who cannot even keep to a time limit can\nhardly expect to keep anything together.[VAR 0114(0048)]
If you wish to reattempt my trial, please come\nand speak with me again.[VAR 0114(0048)]
You failed yet again...[VAR 0114(0048)]
I now find myself strangely at a loss over the\ncorrect course of action.[VAR 0114(0048)]
You have failed my trial many times over, yes, but\nyou always pick yourself up to try once more.[VAR 0114(0048)]
That in itself could be considered more noble\nthan reaching a goal within a set time.[VAR 0114(0048)]
...I will count your numerous attempts at my trial\nas proof of your worthiness. You pass.\c\nThis seems a fitting result for someone whose\nvery presence in the club is already exceptional.[VAR 0114(0048)]
However, be warned that you will find no such\nleniency when you face me in battle.[VAR 0114(0048)]

You’ve earned the right to face me in battle.[VAR 0114(0048)]
Do you wish to begin?[VAR 0114(0048)]
You refuse...? Very well.[VAR 0114(0048)]
Understood. Let’s assume our battle positions.[VAR 0114(0048)]
Shall we move ahead with our battle?[VAR 0114(0048)]
Amarys’s Skarmory is one tough customer! You\ngot what it takes to pierce its steely defenses?

Position assumed.[VAR 0114(0048)]
There is one thing I wanted to ask you...[VAR 0114(0048)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]It concerns Kieran. What is he to you,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0048)]
He’s my pal
He’s my rival
I don’t really know
So, you consider him a friend... I see.[VAR 0114(0048)]
So, you consider him a worthy adversary... I see.[VAR 0114(0048)]
So, you are uncertain... I see.[VAR 0114(0048)]
For my part, Kieran is the younger brother of my\ndear friend, Carmine.[VAR 0114(0048)]
Something in him has changed—he is not his\nusual self. I find this deeply concerning.[VAR 0114(0048)]
If possible...I want to be the one to help him.[VAR 0114(0048)]
That being the case, I cannot afford to lose.[VAR 0114(0048)]
...Our battle starts now.[VAR 0114(0048)]
The strength of one’s Pokémon reflects the\nstrength of one’s beliefs.[VAR 0114(0048)]
Your desire to help Kieran is evidently greater\nthan my own.[VAR 0114(0048)]
You got that right!
No, you care plenty!
...How frustrating.[VAR 0114(0048)]
[VAR BD06(0000)][VAR 0100(0000)]... You truly are a\nkind\r\nperson.[VAR 0114(0048)]
All right, then.[VAR 0114(0048)]
Time for a photo. We must ensure that your\nvictory here is properly commemorated.[VAR 0114(0048)]
I will give you this TM, too. It contains a favorite\nmove of mine.[VAR 0114(0048)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]It is up to you to help Kieran,\n[VAR 0100(0000)].\r\nI\r\nentrust\r\nmy\r\nwish\r\nto\r\nyou.[VAR 0114(0048)]
...Time for me to go.\c\nSo long.[VAR 0114(0048)]

Welcome! Feel free to look around and get\nacquainted with our Elite Four team!
Welcome to the Coastal Plaza! We’re the team\nthat supports Miss Lacey of the Elite Four!
[VAR BD06(0000)]And you’re...[VAR 0100(0000)], right?\nOne\r\nof\r\nthe\r\nBB\r\nLeague\r\nchallengers?
You’ll need to hand over 50 BP if you want\nto take on the Elite Trial here.\c\nAre you ready and willing to pay?
I hate to have to be the one to tell you this, but\nyou don’t have enough BP. You can earn some by\r\ntaking on BBQs, though!
You paid 50 BP!
Thank you very much! Duly received and noted!
We need you over here, Miss Lacey!
Comiiing![VAR 0114(0049)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Oh, if it isn’t [VAR 0100(0000)]! I’m so glad\nyou\r\ndecided\r\nto\r\npay\r\nme\r\na visit![VAR 0114(0049)]
Please follow me. I’ll show you to the trial site![VAR 0114(0049)]

Text File : sdc02_4kings_c_02
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Thank you for coming to the Coastal Plaza to\nchallenge me.[VAR 0114(0049)]
And...I really am sorry for the way I protested\nyou joining the BB League, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0049)]
Of course, it’s true that this is quite irregular\nunder the bylaws of our school clubs.[VAR 0114(0049)]
But mainly I didn’t want you to get dragged into\nthe drama that’s been troubling the club lately.[VAR 0114(0049)]
I suppose our trial has already officially begun,\nthough, so let’s get to it and have some fun![VAR 0114(0049)]
The trial that I came up with is...a [VAR FF00(0006)]Pokémon quiz[VAR FF00(0000)]![VAR 0114(0049)]
I’ll ask you five questions about Pokémon. If you\ncan answer them all correctly, then you pass![VAR 0114(0049)]
Are you ready to attempt my Pokémon quiz,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0049)]
I’m ready!
Explain again?
Maybe later
Great! Then I’ll just get everything ready...[VAR 0114(0049)]
All right, here we go! And look—it’s everyone’s\nfavorite Pokémon, Pikachu, here to help![VAR 0114(0049)]
And with that...question one![VAR 0114(0049)]
Pikachu is an Electric-type Pokémon well known\nfor producing electricity within its body.[VAR 0114(0049)]
But in which part of its body does it store the\nelectricity it generates?[VAR 0114(0049)]
Go right for the body part that you think is\ncorrect![VAR 0114(0049)]
[~ 127]
Ding ding ding! You got it!\c\nPikachu stores its electricity in the electric sacs\nin its [VAR FF00(0006)]cheeks[VAR FF00(0000)]![VAR 0114(0049)]
If you poke the sacs, you’ll get a little shock, but\ndon’t you think they’re just super round and cute?[VAR 0114(0049)]
Now then...I think we’re ready to move on to\nour next quiz question![VAR 0114(0049)]
Hmm?! Oh no, what a shame—but that’s not the\nright part at all![VAR 0114(0049)]
I’ll give you a hint: the part you’re looking for is\na different color from the rest of Pikachu’s body.[VAR 0114(0049)]
Hmm?! Really?! No, no, I’m afraid that’s still the\nwrong part of poor Pikachu.\c\nAnd that’s two strikes, which means...[VAR 0114(0049)]
[~ 127]
Now you have to battle me! Lose, and you’ll fail\nthe trial!
Since you won, you get a free walk—meaning you\ncan move on without answering the question![VAR 0114(0049)]
But Pikachu stores electricity in its [VAR FF00(0006)]cheeks[VAR FF00(0000)], you\nknow! That’s where its electric sacs are![VAR 0114(0049)]
Take a look at Venonat here! It’s bigger than\nyou’d think it would be, isn’t it? But it’s also fluffy\r\nand squeezable and terribly adorable, really![VAR 0114(0049)]
So here we go with question two![VAR 0114(0049)]
Even on the darkest of nights, Venonat is able to\nuse a certain part of its body like radar, which\r\nallows it to detect surrounding objects.[VAR 0114(0049)]
What part of Venonat’s body acts like radar?[VAR 0114(0049)]
Go right for the body part that you think is\ncorrect![VAR 0114(0049)]
Ding ding ding! That’s right! It’s Venonat’s big\n[VAR FF00(0006)]eyes[VAR FF00(0000)] that serve as radar![VAR 0114(0049)]
Isn’t Venonat even more adorable when you think\nabout how it sees a whole world we can’t see?![VAR 0114(0049)]
Now then...I think we’re ready to move on to\nour next quiz question![VAR 0114(0049)]
Hmm?! Oooh, that’s close...but incorrect! I do\nsee why you’d think that, though![VAR 0114(0049)]
I’ll give you a hint: what we’re looking for is quite\na large part of Venonat’s body. Now guess again![VAR 0114(0049)]
Hmm?! Really?! No, no, I’m afraid that’s still the\nwrong part of this adorable Venonat.\c\nAnd that’s two strikes, which means...[VAR 0114(0049)]
[~ 127]
Did you just want to battle all along?
Since you won, you get a free walk—meaning you\ncan move on without answering the question![VAR 0114(0049)]
Venonat actually uses its large [VAR FF00(0006)]eyes [VAR FF00(0000)]like radar to\nhelp it get around![VAR 0114(0049)]
Getting weary of my quiz? How about a cup of\ntea—or maybe these three Sinistea siblings?[VAR 0114(0049)]
Here’s question three![VAR 0114(0049)]
Sinistea like to live in precious antique teacups![VAR 0114(0049)]
But there are a lot of phonies out there! It’s hard\nto tell which cups are genuine antiques...[VAR 0114(0049)]
One of these three Sinistea is an Antique Form\nSinistea, meaning it found a real antique cup![VAR 0114(0049)]
So which Sinistea has the real deal?![VAR 0114(0049)]
Ding ding ding! You spotted it!\c\nThat’s right. An Antique Form Sinistea can be\nrecognized by the [VAR FF00(0006)]mark [VAR FF00(0000)]on the bottom of its cup![VAR 0114(0049)]
But it doesn’t matter whether they’re Antique\nForm or Phony Form! They’re all so darn cute![VAR 0114(0049)]
Now then...I think we’re ready to move on to\nour next quiz question![VAR 0114(0049)]
Hmm?! Oh, no no no. That’s not the right one.[VAR 0114(0049)]
You might find a clue if you pay attention to the\nunderside of the cups! Now try again![VAR 0114(0049)]
Hmm?! No, no, that’s still not the right one!\nAnd since that’s two strikes now...[VAR 0114(0049)]
[~ 127]
Who’s missing this easy question, huh?!
Since you won, you get a free walk—meaning you\ncan move on without answering the question![VAR 0114(0049)]
The Antique Form Sinistea was the middle one!\nThe [VAR FF00(0006)]mark[VAR FF00(0000)] on the bottom of its cup proves it, see?[VAR 0114(0049)]
This is the Meteor Pokémon, Minior! It comes\nin all kinds of different colors, you know.[VAR 0114(0049)]
I’ll first ask you to take a gooooood look at this\npinkish Minior for me, mmkay?[VAR 0114(0049)]
All right, guys! Mix yourselves up real good![VAR 0114(0049)]
Perfect! Now we’re ready for question four![VAR 0114(0049)]
Which of these is the pinkish Minior that I first\nshowed you?![VAR 0114(0049)]
[~ 127]
Ding ding ding! You did it!\c\nEven after they returned to their Meteor Form,\nyou still managed to find the right one![VAR 0114(0049)]
Aren’t Minior adorable? Their coloration varies\nbased on what they eat.[VAR 0114(0049)]
Now then...I think we’re ready to move on to\nthe very last quiz question![VAR 0114(0049)]
Hmm?! Oof, no, I’m afraid not! That’s not the\npink one I showed you![VAR 0114(0049)]
Sorry, guys, one more time! Give yourselves\nanother good mixing![VAR 0114(0049)]
Now which Minior is the pink Minior that I first\nshowed you?![VAR 0114(0049)]
Hmm?! Oof, no, I’m afraid not! That one isn’t\npink! And since you’ve struck out twice...[VAR 0114(0049)]
[~ 127]
Spinning! Quizzing! It all makes your brain dizzy!\nBattling is simple and easy!
Since you won, you get a free walk—meaning you\ncan move on without answering the question![VAR 0114(0049)]
If you were wondering, this is where that precious\npink Minior was![VAR 0114(0049)]
Oh, look! Here comes Granbull! Maybe it heard\nthe word “pink” and decided to stop by![VAR 0114(0049)]
This little sweetie is one of my own Pokémon.\nIt’s always with me.[VAR 0114(0049)]
Our last question, question five, will involve\nGranbull here![VAR 0114(0049)]
Granbull is a quiet, delicate, and lovable\nPokémon, of course, but can you tell me this:[VAR 0114(0049)]
When I take a nap with my adorable Granbull,\nwhich part of its body do I use as a pillow?![VAR 0114(0049)]
Ding ding ding! That’s exactly right! I use that\nsoft, adorable [VAR FF00(0006)]tummy[VAR FF00(0000)]![VAR 0114(0049)]
When I cuddle up to it, it’s so soft and cozy.\nWe both fall asleep in just seconds![VAR 0114(0049)]
And that’s the end of my quiz![VAR 0114(0049)]
You managed to get all five of my questions\nright, which means...[VAR 0114(0049)]
You got through all the questions, even if you\ndid have to fight your way through, so...[VAR 0114(0049)]
congratulations, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0049)]
You’ve officially cleared my Elite Trial![VAR 0114(0049)]
Why don’t we head back to the plaza?[VAR 0114(0049)]
OK, here’s a hint! I’m the type who prefers a\nnice, soft pillow under my head.\c\nNow guess again![VAR 0114(0049)]
Ooh, I’m afraid that’s two strikes...[VAR 0114(0049)]
[~ 127]
You’ll be crying into your pillow when I’m done\nwith you! You’ll practically have to wring it out!
You won the battle, which means you get to\nskip answering my final quiz question![VAR 0114(0049)]
But of course, the part of Granbull that I use as\na pillow is its [VAR FF00(0006)]tummy[VAR FF00(0000)]![VAR 0114(0049)]
Bzzzt! Nope! Wrong answer!\c\nSure, when it folds its arms, they are all squishy,\nand it’s awfully cute, but I still feel a bit bad\r\nputting my head on them...[VAR 0114(0049)]
Bzzzt! Nope! Wrong answer!\c\nThough its ears sure are soft and bendy,\nso maybe that’s not a bad idea...[VAR 0114(0049)]
Bzzzt! Nope! Wrong answer!\c\nThough having those hard fangs dig into your\nscalp while you sleep might be invigorating...[VAR 0114(0049)]
Bzzzt! Nope! Wrong answer!\c\nThough it’s pure delight when we put our heads\ntogether and sleep side by side, too...[VAR 0114(0049)]
Bzzzt! Nope! Wrong answer!\c\nThough I have ended up using its legs as pillows\nbefore. I tend to roll around in my sleep...[VAR 0114(0049)]
In which part of its body does a Pikachu store electricity?
Which part of a Venonat’s body functions like radar?
Which Sinistea is an Antique Form Sinistea?
Which Minior is the pink one you saw first?
Which part of Granbull does Lacey use as a pillow?

Since you passed my Elite Trial, you’ve earned\nthe right to challenge me to a battle![VAR 0114(0049)]
But what do you want to do now? Ready to move\nstraight to it?[VAR 0114(0049)]
No problem! I’ll be ready whenever you are.[VAR 0114(0049)]
Got it! No time to waste, then, right? Let’s get\nto our positions![VAR 0114(0049)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]What’s up, [VAR 0100(0000)]? Are you\nready\r\nto\r\nbattle\r\nme now?[VAR 0114(0049)]
Don’t think our Lacey is just a cute face! She’s a\nforce to be feared with that Excadrill of hers.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Text File : sdc02_4kings_c_04
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
OK... This should be about far enough.[VAR 0114(0049)]
Let me properly introduce myself for this.\c\nI am Lacey of the Elite Four.[VAR 0114(0049)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]I really didn’t expect I’d get a challenge from\nsomeone like you, [VAR 0100(0000)].\r\nRightfully,\r\nyou\r\ndo\r\nbelong\r\nto a\r\ndifferent\r\nschool.[VAR 0114(0049)]
Honestly, I’m still a bit shocked, but I won’t let\nmy personal feelings get in the way of our battle![VAR 0114(0049)]
So, ah, let’s see. First of all, I should tell you\nI mostly use Fairy-type Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0049)]
There’s just nothing like an adorable pink fairy,\nright?[VAR 0114(0049)]
They’re weak to Poison and Steel. Anything too\ncaustic or cutting just doesn’t suit them.[VAR 0114(0049)]
Oh, but you must know all this already, right,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0049)]
Now, for this battle, I’m not going to hold\nanything back.[VAR 0114(0049)]
I want to be sure you walk away with a proper\nunderstanding, after all.[VAR 0114(0049)]
You’re about to learn that cuteness is real\nstrength![VAR 0114(0049)]
[VAR BD06(0000)][VAR 0100(0000)]!\n[VAR 0100(0000)]!\r\nDid you see?[VAR 0114(0049)]
Did you see our Pokémon battling it out?![VAR 0114(0049)]
Oooh, it’s almost too much—they were just too\ncute, even for me![VAR 0114(0049)]
They were super cute!
They were super cool!
You’re the cutest, Lacey!
Hee hee! For sure! And I get the best view as a\nTrainer since I’m so close to the action![VAR 0114(0049)]
Bzzzt! Nope! Wrong! We’re not talking about\nbeing cool. We’re talking about being CUTE![VAR 0114(0049)]
Bzzzt! Nope! Wrong! We’re not talking about\nme. We’re talking about my POKÉMON![VAR 0114(0049)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Your Pokémon were very cute as well,\n[VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0049)]
Phew... You know, it’s just not right for two\npeople to hog all this cuteness between them.[VAR 0114(0049)]
Why don’t we wrangle up the cute Pokémon here\nfor a cute picture we can share with everyone?[VAR 0114(0049)]
Oooh, this one is just too cute! I’m going to\nmake myself a backup copy or three...[VAR 0114(0049)]
I’ll give you this as well, as proof of your\ncuteness.[VAR 0114(0049)]
You really are very strong when you get serious\nin battle, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0049)]
I wonder how far you’ll be able to get, facing off\nagainst the strongest Trainers in our school...\r\nI’ll be keeping an eye on you and your progress![VAR 0114(0049)]
Congratulations on your victory over our Miss\nLacey, the Elite Four member for this biome!

Welcome! Feel free to look around and get\nacquainted with our Elite Four team!
Welcome to the Polar Plaza! We’re the team that\nsupports Drayton of the Elite Four!
[VAR BD06(0000)]And you’re...[VAR 0100(0000)], right?\nOne\r\nof\r\nthe\r\nBB\r\nLeague\r\nchallengers?
You’ll need to hand over 50 BP if you want\nto take on the Elite Trial here.\c\nAre you ready and willing to pay?
Whoa, hold up! My friend here gets in free![VAR 0114(004A)]
A-are you sure, Drayster? The rules say—
Just charge it to my account. That oughta take\ncare of it, yeah?[VAR 0114(004A)]
That’s not—\n...OK, understood. I’ll make an exception.
Many thanks, my man.[VAR 0114(004A)]
There’s my Champ in the making! Thanks\nfor coming.[VAR 0114(004A)]
Let’s hit the battle court real quick.[VAR 0114(004A)]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Text File : sdc02_4kings_d_02
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Feast your eyes on the majesty of the Polar Plaza\nbattle court![VAR 0114(004A)]
Nah, it’s basically the exact same battle court as\nin the other plazas, just colder.[VAR 0114(004A)]
I’m a cold-weather kinda guy. Not what you’d\nexpect from a Dragon-type user, right?[VAR 0114(004A)]
Anyhow, buddy, you came to do my Elite Trial,\nnot listen to me ramble. So let’s hop to it![VAR 0114(004A)]
I call my Elite Trial [VAR FF00(0006)]Terarium-Only Battles[VAR FF00(0000)]![VAR 0114(004A)]
Your goal’s to clobber three of your fellow\nLeague Clubbers in battle. Simple enough, right?[VAR 0114(004A)]
But it’s called Terarium-Only for a reason! You\ncan only use Pokémon that meet two conditions.[VAR 0114(004A)]
First, they gotta be Pokémon that were [VAR FF00(0006)]caught[VAR FF00(0000)]\n[VAR FF00(0006)]living wild in the Terarium[VAR FF00(0000)]![VAR 0114(004A)]
Second, [VAR FF00(0006)]YOU gotta be the one who caught ’em[VAR FF00(0000)]![VAR 0114(004A)]
Unless your whole party of Pokémon meets\nthose conditions, no Elite Trial for you.[VAR 0114(004A)]
I know, I’m asking a lot. But what fun would it\nbe if you just dipped into your vault of beefy\r\nPokémon and cheesed your way through?[VAR 0114(004A)]
Your opponents are under the same conditions,\nso you can’t be too mad about it.[VAR 0114(004A)]
Whaddya say, bud? Ready for my Elite Trial?[VAR 0114(004A)]
I’m ready!
Explain again?
Maybe later
That’s your cue, underlings! C’mon out![VAR 0114(004A)]
	           I’m ready!\nHello!			         	  Let’s go![VAR 0114(004D)]
My trial’s about skill, but it’s chill. Take it at\nwhatever pace you want.[VAR 0114(004A)]
If you wanna dive right into battling your three\nclubmates, go nuts![VAR 0114(004A)]
Rather stroll around the Terarium catching\nPokémon first? No problem![VAR 0114(004A)]
So go on, get out there and chill it up.\nGood luck! Everyone give it your best shot![VAR 0114(004A)]
Wanna dive right into battling? Rather go take a\nbreather? Either way’s good.\c\nShow me your skill, but it’s chill.[VAR 0114(004A)]
I love Pokémon with some brittle gray tones!\nReady to battle me?
Gray-cious me! Your Pokémon do[VAR 1101(00FD,0002)]esn’t meet the\ntrial conditions!\c\nCome back with only Pokémon you caught\nyourself here in the Terarium!
Hoo-gray! Good luck to both of us!
You’ve got my support! I know you’ll do gray-t!
I’m quite the cool customer. Ready to shiver?
Oh, wait. Your Pokémon do[VAR 1101(00FD,0002)]esn’t meet the\nconditions for this trial.\c\nCome back with only Pokémon you caught\nyourself here in the Terarium.
Heh. You’re on!
Don’t let the cold wear you down. I’m sending\ncool waves of encouragement your way.
Y’know Iono? The streamer? I use the same type\nas her, so like, ready for a shock?
You know your Pokémon do[VAR 1101(00FD,0002)]esn’t meet the trial\nconditions, right?\c\nCome back with only Pokémon you caught\nyourself here in the Terarium!
Here we go! Zap! Pew pew pew!
Keep it up! I’ll be watchin’ over your electrifying\nbattles!
So that makes, let’s see...\nOne...two...three...[VAR 0114(004A)]
Nice! You went and beat all three of ’em![VAR 0114(004A)]
Which means this Elite Trial is Elite Complete![VAR 0114(004A)]
All right, my League Club assistants. Retreat! On\nthe double![VAR 0114(004A)]
	       	Good-bye!\nGood battle!		         	    See ya![VAR 0114(004D)]
Aren’t they great? No grumbling or nothing.\nBuncha sweethearts.[VAR 0114(004A)]
Good luck with the Elite Trial!

Looks like it’s finally time for you and me\nto battle.[VAR 0114(004A)]
Guess you’re still using the party you put\ntogether for my challenge though, huh? Go\r\nahead, take a sec to change it up.\c\nUnless you wanna dive right into battle...?[VAR 0114(004A)]
Got it. No rush on my end.[VAR 0114(004A)]
All right. It’s on![VAR 0114(004A)]
Ready to take me on, bud?[VAR 0114(004A)]
Drayton’s partner Pokémon packs a punch!\nAnd the way it unfolds is so cool!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Hmm. Here should be good.[VAR 0114(004A)]
Y’know, I was thinking about the look you get\nwhen you’re in battle...[VAR 0114(004A)]
and I realized I’ve only ever seen you like that\nfrom the sidelines.[VAR 0114(004A)]
Guess now I know what it’s like to face you\nfrom across the court![VAR 0114(004A)]
Lemme be real—I’m counting on you to conquer\nthe whole BB League, bud.[VAR 0114(004A)]
I mean it. I need you to pull this off! You gotta\ncome through for me![VAR 0114(004A)]
That said...[VAR 0114(004A)]
I’m not just gonna roll over and miss out on the\nfun. So watch out.[VAR 0114(004A)]
But no need for us to get all official or anything![VAR 0114(004A)]
Just battle me normally like you would anybody\nelse, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(004A)]
Here’s the 100-percent Drayster truth: I’m so\npsyched I’m practically tingling.[VAR 0114(004A)]
So why don’t we get this rolling, nice and easy?[VAR 0114(004A)]
Let’s go, bud. Show me a good time![VAR 0114(004A)]
Heh heh heh! Man, that was ridiculous. So\nmuch fun.[VAR 0114(004A)]
I knew inviting you to join the League Club was\nthe right move![VAR 0114(004A)]
And I guess if you can beat me, we better make\nyou a full member, finally! Whaddya say? Ready\r\nto be the real deal?[VAR 0114(004A)]
Heh heh! Bless you and your generous heart![VAR 0114(004A)]
Aw, no need to play hard to get! I know I saw the\nspark of enthusiasm in your eye...[VAR 0114(004A)]
C’mon, let’s get a photo of you for the club\nroster![VAR 0114(004A)]
Lacey probably woulda wanted a more serious\nphoto. She might not be thrilled, but oh well.[VAR 0114(004A)]
I feel like there was one more thing I’m supposed\nto do...[VAR 0114(004A)]
Oh, yeah. We gotta give TMs to whoever can\nbeat us Elite Four members.[VAR 0114(004A)]
I gotta go grab that. Wait here a sec.[VAR 0114(004A)]
Congratulations on besting Drayton of the Elite\nFour!

Hey there, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0008)]
Is this your clubroom? Hope so, since I came to\nraid it![VAR 0114(0008)]
Blueberry Academy is, like, unreal. I can’t believe\nyou get to study here![VAR 0114(0008)]
But, uh, there sure are a lot of people in this\nroom I don’t know...\c\nMakes me kinda nervous...[VAR 0114(0008)]
Aw, you’ll be fine!
Push past the nerves!
[VAR BD06(0000)]Um, yeah... I dunno...\c\nNot everyone can be as outgoing as you,\n[VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0008)]
I guess I can try toughing it out a little longer if\nI think of this as extrovert practice...[VAR 0114(0008)]
Just don’t leave me alone for too long, OK?\nNew places are a lot for me to deal with.[VAR 0114(0008)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Hey, [VAR 0100(0000)]! Do you have\nany\r\nidea\r\nhow\r\namazing\r\nthis\r\nacademy\r\nreally is?[VAR 0114(0008)]
I sure do!
How do you mean?
Really?! Is Blueberry Academy famous enough\nthat everyone knows all about it?\c\nWell, let me tell you what I found out anyway.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Oh, you didn’t know? I did some digging since I\nwas curious, and I found out some cool stuff...[VAR 0114(0008)]
The academy has this resource development\nplant on one of its lower levels, way down on\r\nthe seabed.[VAR 0114(0008)]
They do all sorts of marine research down there,\nand they survey the seabed for resources, too![VAR 0114(0008)]
I heard students aren’t allowed to visit though,\nwhich I guess isn’t all that surprising...[VAR 0114(0008)]
But to think that cutting-edge science is going on\nbelow us right now...it’s like some kind of dream![VAR 0114(0008)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Ah, [VAR 0100(0000)]! Something big\nhappened![VAR 0114(0008)]
Tell me all about it!
I’m not interested...
Yesss! I knew you’d wanna hear! I’m still buzzing\nfrom the excitement![VAR 0114(0008)]
Huh? That’s not a very “you” thing to say! But\nit won’t take long, so I’ll just tell you![VAR 0114(0008)]
Remember the resource development plant I\nmentioned? The one beneath the academy?!\r\nI got to go inside! It was incredible![VAR 0114(0008)]
So, I’m at Blueberry’s entrance, having a look\naround, right?[VAR 0114(0008)]
Then this dapper old guy in a white suit shows up\nand tells me he’ll take me to the plant if I want![VAR 0114(0008)]
He had, like, this amazingly cheerful, impish air\nabout him. I wonder what his deal was...\c\nIt almost felt like he was one of the feyfolk\ndisguised as an old guy![VAR 0114(0008)]
You might be right!
That’s the director...
Oh, you think so too? Yeah, he had a real special\naura... I’m sure that must be it!\c\nI’ll keep looking into this dapper fey fellow and\nfind out who he really is![VAR 0114(0008)]
What?! That dapper guy’s the DIRECTOR?\c\nIs it some kinda requirement for academy\ndirectors to be eccentrics or something?!\r\nI mean, first Director Clavell and now him?![VAR 0114(0008)]
Blueberry Academy really is incredible.\c\nI wasn’t sure about accepting your invite at first,\nbut I’m glad I did![VAR 0114(0008)]
Don’t think of this as, like, a thank-you gift for\ninviting me or anything...[VAR 0114(0008)]
but do you wanna trade Pokémon with me?[VAR 0114(0008)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Nice! I’ll offer up a Veevee from my end, of\ncourse. I’ve got a real feisty one just for you!\c\nWhich Pokémon will you go for,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0008)]
[VAR BD06(0000)][VAR 0101(0001)], huh... This Pokémon’s so\nyou.\r\nI’ll\r\ntreasure\r\nit\r\nforever![VAR 0114(0008)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]OK! So we’ll go ahead and trade your\n[VAR 0101(0001)]\r\nfor\r\nmy\r\nVeevee,\r\nright?[VAR 0114(0008)]
You can’t trade Penny a Pokémon if you aren’t its\noriginal Trainer!
You can’t trade Penny such a rare Pokémon!
You can’t trade Penny a Shiny Pokémon!
Wait...we can’t trade if there’s only one Pokémon\nin your party. You need at least two, OK?[VAR 0114(0008)]
Oh, you don’t want to trade just yet? OK, well,\nmy Veevee and I will wait right here for you.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Are you ready to trade Pokémon now?[VAR 0114(0008)]
Ooh, from that glint in your eye I’m guessing\nyou wanna raid—er, I mean battle! Am I right?[VAR 0114(0008)]
Aw. I thought I recognized that little sparkle of\nyours, but guess I was off.[VAR 0114(0008)]
If someone challenges me to a battle, you know\nI’ve got no choice but to accept![VAR 0114(0008)]
[~ 60]
Geeeeeez, how do you keep beating all my\nVeevees anyway? I don’t get it...[VAR 0114(0008)]
But you know...I’m so glad I got to meet you.\c\nI never thought I’d get this close with anyone\nelse, like I did with my friends in Team Star.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Ah, sorry! That came out of nowhere, didn’t it?\nI, err...I just felt the need to say it.\c\nAnyway. Here! For you![VAR 0114(0008)]
So, er, that wraps that up! Hasta la vistar! ☆[VAR 0114(0008)]
[~ 60]
I can’t believe you’re the Veevee victor again!\nMy energy levels are getting seriously depleted...[VAR 0114(0008)]
Welp, till next time, then. Hasta la vistar! ☆[VAR 0114(0008)]
Hehe. Did you expect any less from the big boss\nof Team Star? My Veevees reign supreme![VAR 0114(0008)]
The Terarium sure is something else. It’s easy to\nforget you’re actually indoors when the dome\r\nlooks just like the sky.\c\nHow do they do that anyway?[VAR 0114(0008)]
You know how Squawkabilly are used to ferry the\nFlying Taxis around back in Paldea?\c\nWell, where I’m from we use Corviknight—and in\nthe Terarium, it’s yet another different Pokémon![VAR 0114(0008)]
Thanks again for inviting me to visit all these\nplaces with you.\c\nIt’s not the easiest thing for a former shut-in like\nme to do, but...I always end up having fun.[VAR 0114(0008)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]The [VAR 0101(0001)] you traded me is getting\non\r\ngreat\r\nwith\r\nmy\r\nVeevees![VAR 0114(0008)]
How’s my feisty li’l Veevee doing?\c\nYou can have him evolve any way you like, or you\ncan have him stay an Eevee forever!\c\nThat’s what makes Eevee so great.[VAR 0114(0008)]

[VAR BD06(0000)]Ta-ta-tachán! Hey, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nI’m\r\nheeere![VAR 0114(0004)]
Man, Blueberry Academy’s awesome![VAR 0114(0004)]
It’s wild how different Blueberry Academy is from\nour school back home, huh?[VAR 0114(0004)]
I snagged a quick look inside the Terarium. I can’t\nbelieve it’s all underwater! It all looks just like...\r\nregular above-water![VAR 0114(0004)]
And I heard the school puts a super-heavy focus\non Pokémon battling, too!\c\nThat means I can battle to my heart’s content\nhere, right? Right?![VAR 0114(0004)]
Yeah! Great, right?
Uh, within reason
Yesss! As soon as I’ve taken care of what you\ncalled me for, I gotta battle every student here![VAR 0114(0004)]
Oh, yeah! Sorry!\c\nYou’re right—I need to save some energy to\nbattle you too![VAR 0114(0004)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Y’know, I’m really glad you invited me,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]!\r\nThanks\r\nso much![VAR 0114(0004)]
I had a walk around the Terarium, and there were\nSO MANY Pokémon I’d never seen before![VAR 0114(0004)]
I thought about this a lot in Kitakami, too—it’s so\ncool seein’ unfamiliar Pokémon just living their\r\nlives as they do in nature![VAR 0114(0004)]
Reading about ’em in textbooks can’t hold a\ncandle to seeing ’em for real, y’know?[VAR 0114(0004)]
It’s so real this way!
It’s so novel this way!
Exacto! You get me![VAR 0114(0004)]
Though, come to think of it, I guess there was a\ntime when even the wild Pokémon of Paldea were\r\nbrand-new to me![VAR 0114(0004)]
I actually moved to Paldea when I was seven.[VAR 0114(0004)]
I hadn’t had a taste of Pokémon battles yet back\nthen. Sometimes I forget what it was like being\r\nthat age![VAR 0114(0004)]
I guess it’s good to keep having that same sense\nof wonder as when we were young![VAR 0114(0004)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]So, [VAR 0100(0000)]! You know\nabout\r\nthe\r\nBB\r\nLeague,\r\ndon’t you?[VAR 0114(0004)]
Sure I do!
First I’ve heard of it...
I KNEW it! Why didn’t you tell me right away?![VAR 0114(0004)]
I’m not falling for that! I’ve done my homework![VAR 0114(0004)]
And what’s more, everyone’s saying the\nChampion of this League is YOU![VAR 0114(0004)]
It’s true!
First I’ve heard of it...
You ARE the Champion! C’mon, you shoulda told\nme the awesome news sooner![VAR 0114(0004)]
You can’t fool me! I’ll call witnesses if I have to![VAR 0114(0004)]
I am just drooling to battle the Champion of the\nBB League! But even more importantly...[VAR 0114(0004)]
I’m SO proud that my rival’s been smashing it all\nover the place![VAR 0114(0004)]
So...I guess what I’m saying is...I shall forever\nremain proud to be your rival![VAR 0114(0004)]
Whoops, I got a little formal there. Just too\nstruck by your accomplishments, I guess![VAR 0114(0004)]
Y’know, it just occurred to me—we’ve battled\ntons, but we’ve never traded once![VAR 0114(0004)]
Well, there’s no time like the present—why don’t\nwe trade Pokémon?![VAR 0114(0004)]
Yesss! Toma ya! I think I’ll trade you a Tauros.\nWhat’ll you trade me?[VAR 0114(0004)]
[VAR BD06(0000)][VAR 0101(0001)]’s a great Pokémon! I’ll train it\nup\r\nso\r\nwell,\r\nit’ll\r\nbe\r\nunbeatable.\r\nThanks\r\nfor\r\ntrading![VAR 0114(0004)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Nice! I’m good to trade my Tauros for your\n[VAR 0101(0001)]\r\nif\r\nyou are![VAR 0114(0004)]
You can’t trade Nemona a Pokémon if you\naren’t its original Trainer!
You can’t trade Nemona such a rare Pokémon!
You can’t trade Nemona a Shiny Pokémon!
Oh, wait—you can’t go trading if you’ve only got\none Pokémon with ya.\c\nI think we better hold off until you’ve got at\nleast two in your party![VAR 0114(0004)]
Oh, got something else you need to do? Gotcha!\nLet’s do it another time![VAR 0114(0004)]
Hey, we still haven’t traded Pokémon yet.\nLet’s trade it up![VAR 0114(0004)]
Hey, if you’ve got a few minutes, wanna battle?[VAR 0114(0004)]
Awww. Still fine-tuning your party or something? I\nwas really hoping for a battle...[VAR 0114(0004)]
Yesss! You’re on. Let’s have us a fruitful battle![VAR 0114(0004)]
[~ 62]
Yup, that was a great one for sure! And an L for\nme![VAR 0114(0004)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]I hope you and I keep on battling forever,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]—\r\neven\r\nwhen\r\nwe’re\r\ngrown up.[VAR 0114(0004)]
In fact, we GOTTA keep battling! Let’s call it a\npromise! Here—something to seal the deal.[VAR 0114(0004)]
Think of me when you use it! Best rivals forever![VAR 0114(0004)]
[~ 62]
That’s another L for me. Thanks for battling me![VAR 0114(0004)]
I’ll getcha next time! Can’t wait![VAR 0114(0004)]
Toma ya! That’s a W for me! You fought\ngreat, though![VAR 0114(0004)]
It seems like they don’t have too many classes in\nthe classrooms here at Blueberry Academy, huh?\c\nI can’t believe they can just hold classes out in\nthe Terarium! Big-time culture shock![VAR 0114(0004)]
Kitakami was really fun, even though things got\nout of hand! We should all go again sometime![VAR 0114(0004)]
I can’t believe Blueberry Academy has its own\nElite Four!\c\nOooh, I really wanna know what kind of Pokémon\nthey all use![VAR 0114(0004)]
[VAR 0101(0001)]’s really coming to fruition!\c\nIt might be fun to try battling using only Pokémon\nthat we traded each other, huh?[VAR 0114(0004)]
That Tauros I traded you did great in my party\nduring our Treasure Hunt!\c\nI can’t think of a better fit than having you\nbecome his Trainer, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0004)]

Do forgive the intrusion.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Director Clavell of Naranja Academy, at your\nservice.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Director Clavell of Uva Academy, at your service.[VAR 0114(000A)]
I’ve heard all about your adventures here from\nDirector Cyrano.[VAR 0114(000A)]
As I understand it, you’ve already battled your\nway to the top of the League Club and played a\r\nmajor role in an out-of-school expedition.[VAR 0114(000A)]
As your director, I could not be more proud.[VAR 0114(000A)]
But still, I should like to hear your thoughts. How\nhas life at Blueberry Academy been treating you?[VAR 0114(000A)]
It’s so much fun!
It’s, er...well...
That warms my heart to hear. I’m so glad you\nwere able to come here to study.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Ah. Is something here troubling you, perhaps?\c\nDo remember that you can return to Paldea\nwhenever you feel the need.[VAR 0114(000A)]
I’ll be staying here for a while as a special coach,\nso feel free to come and chat anytime.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Well met, M[VAR 1100(00FF,0305)]asteriss [VAR 0100(0000)].\c\nI wanted to ask...has anything in particular been\nwearing you down here at Blueberry Academy?[VAR 0114(000A)]
For instance...Director Cyrano. Has he been\nbothering you with his unreasonable requests?[VAR 0114(000A)]
I’ve been totally fine!
The director’s a nice guy!
I see... Well, that’s reassuring.[VAR 0114(000A)]
You know, Director Cyrano and I studied together\nat the same university, oh, a long time ago now.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Right from the start I found myself rather at the\nmercy of his whims.[VAR 0114(000A)]
This state of affairs continued even once I had\nbeen appointed as director of our academy...[VAR 0114(000A)]
He said to me, “Velly, you need a dash more\ndignity about you. A lofty air! Try wearing some\r\nPremier Balls at your waist—that’ll do it!”[VAR 0114(000A)]
Well, I suppose it’s my own fault for going along\nwith these ideas of his...[VAR 0114(000A)]
In any case, please don’t hesitate to contact me\nif you need any help.[VAR 0114(000A)]
I wanted to talk to you about your exchange\nstudies, M[VAR 1100(00FF,0305)]asteriss [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(000A)]
Thanks to your presence here at Blueberry\nAcademy, I’ve been able to visit more often.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Observing other schools firsthand can be\ninstructive in all sorts of ways, you know.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Right now, I’m considering how we can adopt the\nbest aspects of this school at our own academy\r\nand would appreciate your input on the matter.[VAR 0114(000A)]
So. What is it that you like best about Blueberry\nAcademy, M[VAR 1100(00FF,0305)]asteriss [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(000A)]
The values
The location
The facilities
The director
Oho. Very interesting...\c\nI see you must appreciate the autonomy given to\nstudents here, as well as their vigorous appetite\r\nfor Pokémon battles.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Oho. Very interesting...\c\nIt’s certainly true that an academy floating upon\nthe sea makes for a stunning sight.\c\nBut applying this to our own academy would\nmean uprooting the entire building...[VAR 0114(000A)]
Oho. Very interesting...\c\nIt’s certainly true that the Terarium is ideal for\nobserving Pokémon in their natural habitats.\c\nOf course, I do not believe that Paldea’s own\nrich nature can be found wanting in that regard...[VAR 0114(000A)]
I-I beg your pardon?!\c\nDirector Cyrano certainly is a remarkable man,\nbut if he were to become our academy director,\r\nthat would mean I’d get the boot, so to speak...[VAR 0114(000A)]
Well, in any case, duly noted. Thank you very\nmuch for sharing your thoughts.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Talking with you like this reminds me of your very\nfirst day as one of my students.\c\nThat was the day I gave you your first partner\nPokémon—[VAR 0101(0002)].[VAR 0114(000A)]
I believe you’ve found many treasures of your\nown since then.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Would you consider sharing one of those with\nme...in the form of a Pokémon trade?[VAR 0114(000A)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Much obliged. In that case, I shall offer you a\nPawmo from my side.\c\nWhat Pokémon will you choose, M[VAR 1100(00FF,0305)]asteriss\n[VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(000A)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Thank you very much for trading me your\n[VAR 0101(0001)].\c\nI will treasure it and raise it with all due care.[VAR 0114(000A)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]So you would like to trade your [VAR 0101(0001)]\nfor\r\nmy\r\nPawmo?[VAR 0114(000A)]
You can’t trade Director Clavell a Pokémon if you\naren’t its original Trainer!
You can’t trade Director Clavell such a rare\nPokémon!
You can’t trade Director Clavell a Shiny Pokémon!
Oh, but gracious me! I see you only have one\nPokémon in your party at present.\c\nDo come and see me again once you have at\nleast two Pokémon with you. Then we shall trade.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Do take some time to think about it. I’ll be here\nwhen you have reached a decision.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Would you be willing to share one of your\ntreasures with me through a Pokémon trade?[VAR 0114(000A)]
Oh? Would you like to challenge me to a battle,\nM[VAR 1100(00FF,0305)]asteriss [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(000A)]
If you need someone to talk to, I am always at\nyour disposal.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Well then, I humbly accept. Not as your director,\nmind you, but as a fellow Pokémon Trainer![VAR 0114(000A)]

The Pokémon you have raised certainly are\ntreasures of inestimable value.[VAR 0114(000A)]
...Ah! But how very careless of me. I almost forgot\nthat I have something to give you.[VAR 0114(000A)]
A good friend of mine wanted you to have this\nas a token of his thanks.[VAR 0114(000A)]
It’s a rather trendy item of headwear, you know.\nWhy, I’m almost tempted to procure one myself![VAR 0114(000A)]
You received a [VAR FF00(0008)]Clive Wig [VAR FF00(0000)]from Director Clavell!
What a superb battle. I feel we both deserve a\nhearty pat on the back for our efforts.[VAR 0114(000A)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Do make sure that [VAR 0101(0002)] gets plenty\nof\r\nrest,\r\nnow.[VAR 0114(000A)]
What a fiery battle that was! I may have emerged\nas victor, but it could have fallen either way.\c\nThe key is in how we choose to handle defeat...\nbut I believe you know this well enough already.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Sprigatito, Fuecoco, and Quaxly are all rather\neasy to care for and raise.\c\nThat’s why we chose those three as the partner\nPokémon to be given to students who enroll in\r\nour academy.[VAR 0114(000A)]
I purposefully gave no firm deadline for students\nto complete their Treasure Hunt.\c\nFeel free to continue pursuing your adventures\nwherever your heart takes you.[VAR 0114(000A)]
If you’re looking for Director Cyrano, I believe I\nsaw him over by the academy’s entrance.\c\nI do hope he’s paying due attention to the\nacademy’s administrative affairs and not just\r\nlounging about all day...[VAR 0114(000A)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]The [VAR 0101(0001)] you kindly traded me is\nvery\r\ngood\r\ncompany.\c\nWhy, it refuses to even leave my side![VAR 0114(000A)]
Is the Pawmo I traded you doing well?\c\nI caught him during my return trip on that day\nI visited your home, you know.[VAR 0114(000A)]

I have arrived.[VAR 0114(0029)]
You may call me Mr. Saguaro.\c\nI look forward to working with you.[VAR 0114(0029)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]So it WAS you who called me here, M[VAR 1100(00FF,0305)]asteriss\n[VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0029)]
I had heard that an extraordinary exchange\nstudent making a name for themselves here was\r\ntasked with gathering talent.[VAR 0114(0029)]
I was curious to see what kind of student could\nearn such high renown, but well... Now that I\r\nfind you here, it all makes sense.[VAR 0114(0029)]
Thank you!
I know, right?
Heh... You do not hide your talent, do you? A\nkey to your success, no doubt.[VAR 0114(0029)]
Heh... You have a sense of humor about all this,\ndon’t you? A key to your success, no doubt.[VAR 0114(0029)]
Seeing a student of mine achieve such great\nthings brings me joy.[VAR 0114(0029)]
I’ll do my best here to try and match your own\naccomplishments.[VAR 0114(0029)]
A word, M[VAR 1100(00FF,0305)]asteriss [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0029)]
You see, I recently decided to get a case for my\nRotom Phone.[VAR 0114(0029)]
Now, tell me... Did I put it on right?[VAR 0114(0029)]
Looks good!
Cute case!
Arven has that case!
Thank goodness! This is the very first time I’ve\nattempted something like this...[VAR 0114(0029)]
Oh! So you think so as well?! I’m also very fond\nof this case![VAR 0114(0029)]
Oh? So we have matching cases now, it seems...\nThat boy Arven’s got quite good taste.[VAR 0114(0029)]
I searched everywhere to get my hands on it,\nyou know.\c\nAs it turns out, the Flabébé Flower Case is sold\nonly in Cascarrafa.[VAR 0114(0029)]
I’m quite pleased that I was able to find it in\nthe end.[VAR 0114(0029)]
Allow me to share some good information with\nyou, M[VAR 1100(00FF,0305)]asteriss [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0029)]
You can find the Cream Pokémon Milcery in\nthe Terarium.[VAR 0114(0029)]
Not only is it adorable, but it also emits a\nsweet fragrance. It’s hard to put into words\r\njust how lovely it is...[VAR 0114(0029)]
Are you aware of the peculiar way in which one\ngets Milcery to evolve?[VAR 0114(0029)]
By spinning around
By calling it cute
By feeding it something sweet
That is indeed correct. Have you by chance tried\nthis yourself already?[VAR 0114(0029)]
Well, yes, telling your Pokémon how cute it is\nwill put you both in a lovely mood, but it’s\r\nnot going to evolve from that.[VAR 0114(0029)]
Oh, that’d be lovely if it evolved by eating a\ntasty Peanut Butter Sandwich...\c\nBut, alas, I don’t think that’s ever happened.[VAR 0114(0029)]
If you want a Milcery to evolve, put it in your\nparty and spin around a few times.[VAR 0114(0029)]
When you do that, its cream gets whisked around\nand causes it to become a fluffy Alcremie.[VAR 0114(0029)]
But don’t forget to have your Milcery hold onto\na Sweet item before you attempt this![VAR 0114(0029)]
And be aware that Alcremie’s form will change\ndepending on the Sweet it was holding, as well as\r\nthe way you spin around.[VAR 0114(0029)]
To get my Alcremie looking the way she does, I\nhad to fine-tune my spin with absolute precision![VAR 0114(0029)]
You know, the only reason I was able to meet my\nAlcremie was because you called me here.[VAR 0114(0029)]
You must have met plenty of wonderful Pokémon\non your travels, no?[VAR 0114(0029)]
Why don’t we trade? A Pokémon from you could\ndo much to enlighten me about your journey.[VAR 0114(0029)]
Hmmm... I’ll trade my Hattrem. What about you,\nM[VAR 1100(00FF,0305)]asteriss [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0029)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Yes, I feel like I have a newfound appreciation\nfor all the adventures you’ve been on.\c\nI thank you for the trade, M[VAR 1100(00FF,0305)]asteriss\n[VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0029)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]So, you’d like to trade your [VAR 0101(0001)] for\nmy\r\nHattrem,\r\nyes?[VAR 0114(0029)]
You can’t trade Mr. Saguaro a Pokémon if you\naren’t its original Trainer!
You can’t trade Mr. Saguaro such a rare Pokémon!
You can’t trade Mr. Saguaro a Shiny Pokémon!
...Ah. Sorry, I’m afraid we can’t trade if you’ve\nonly got one Pokémon with you.\c\nWhy don’t we try this again once you have at\nleast two in your party?[VAR 0114(0029)]
Just let me know when you’d like to trade.[VAR 0114(0029)]
Would you like to trade with me?[VAR 0114(0029)]
Oh? Are you interested in battling me,\nChampion?[VAR 0114(0029)]
I’m quite ready for a battle. Just let me know\nwhen.[VAR 0114(0029)]
Yes, of course, let’s battle. I won’t hold back.[VAR 0114(0029)]
[~ 66]
Hmmm, I thought I had trained plenty enough...[VAR 0114(0029)]
But I should expect no less from a Champion.\nYour potential for growth is unparalleled.[VAR 0114(0029)]
You must be tired after battling. Take these.[VAR 0114(0029)]
Sour foods do wonders for exhaustion.[VAR 0114(0029)]
[~ 66]
My, no matter how many battles we have, they\nnever cease to be sweet.[VAR 0114(0029)]
Thank you for asking me to battle.[VAR 0114(0029)]
It isn’t like you to lose like that. You seemed...\ndistracted?\c\nBe sure to take care of yourself and show your\nPokémon some love.[VAR 0114(0029)]
My class here is quite popular—it’s about healthy\nmeals to feed Pokémon after battles. Why don’t\r\nyou join us sometime?[VAR 0114(0029)]
Don’t you think it remarkable that rain falls in the\nTerarium?\c\nOne can have their picnic spoiled by a sudden\ndownpour there, just like anywhere else.[VAR 0114(0029)]
Have you tried the Academy Shake? You can\norder it in the cafeteria.\c\nIt’s so sweet it’ll make your tongue go numb.\nIt’s hard not to smile when you drink it.[VAR 0114(0029)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Your [VAR 0101(0001)] positively gleams! You\nmust\r\nhave\r\ngiven it a carefully balanced diet, no?[VAR 0114(0029)]
How is the Hattrem I traded you faring? Her\ncuteness really is unmatched, isn’t it?[VAR 0114(0029)]

Hello, everyone. It’s a pleasure to meet all of you\nBlueberry students.[VAR 0114(0025)]
My name’s Tyme, and I hope we can all enjoy\nlearning together.[VAR 0114(0025)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Here you are, [VAR 0100(0000)]! I’d\nheard\r\nthe\r\ntalk\r\nabout\r\nyou\r\ngoing\r\nto\r\nstudy\r\nat\r\nBlueberry\r\nAcademy.[VAR 0114(0025)]
You’ve certainly been working hard, haven’t you?\nEven becoming a Champion here![VAR 0114(0025)]
You’ve really made me proud, doing such\noutstanding work.[VAR 0114(0025)]
Please feel free to call on me any time you’d like\nto borrow me or ask for a bit of help.[VAR 0114(0025)]
Help, Ms. Tyme!
You bet I will!
You already want my help with something?\nGoodness, you are a funny one![VAR 0114(0025)]
Well, I like that enthusiasm! I’ll be excited to\nhear from you![VAR 0114(0025)]
I’m sure you’ve got plenty to juggle with your\nclub and your adventures, but don’t forget to\r\noccasionally hit the books as well![VAR 0114(0025)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Pop-quiz time, [VAR 0100(0000)]! How\nabout\r\na\r\nlittle\r\nreview\r\nproblem\r\nfrom\r\nme\r\nto you?[VAR 0114(0025)]
What percent chance does a Pokémon usually\nhave to land a critical hit?[VAR 0114(0025)]
About 1 percent
About 4 percent
About 12 percent
[VAR BD06(0000)]Oh, my. That’s close, [VAR 0100(0000)].\nVery\r\nclose.\c\nBut I’m afraid the right answer is about 4 percent.\nDo your best to remember it now![VAR 0114(0025)]
Well done! I knew I could count on you for this\nquestion, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nYou’ve really absorbed the material, haven’t you?[VAR 0114(0025)]
I have to admit...I’m a bit worried about the\nstudents here at Blueberry Academy.[VAR 0114(0025)]
So much of their coursework is made up of\nbattle studies and the like...[VAR 0114(0025)]
That’s all well and good for the children who\nhope to make a living doing that sort of thing.[VAR 0114(0025)]
But not every dream can come true. What if you\nshut the door to other paths you could take?[VAR 0114(0025)]
Mathematics, home economics, languages...\nYoung people need to know all these things\r\nto be ready for any kind of future.[VAR 0114(0025)]
I don’t think that any learning is truly wasted.\nYou never know what skills you’ll need.[VAR 0114(0025)]
Oh, I’m sorry for talking your ear off, though.\nI didn’t mean to go on like that...[VAR 0114(0025)]
It’s totally fine!
It was good to hear!
[VAR BD06(0000)]Goodness, you are a sweet child! Thank you,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]. Hearing that from\r\nyou\r\nmakes\r\nme\r\nfeel\r\nlike\r\nI\r\ncan\r\nkeep\r\non going![VAR 0114(0025)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]I have to thank you again,\n[VAR 0100(0000)],\r\nfor\r\nlistening\r\nto\r\nthis\r\nold\r\nwoman\r\ngripe\r\nlast time.[VAR 0114(0025)]
After that talk, I went straight to the director here\nand I told him what was on my mind.\c\nI said flat out that he needed to offer a more\ndiverse curriculum than just battle studies.[VAR 0114(0025)]
And how did it go?
I knew you had it in you!
While he won’t be changing the base curriculum,\nhe DID say he had no problem at all with offering\r\nmore subjects as electives![VAR 0114(0025)]
In fact, he said that was part of his motivation\nbehind having you do all this!\c\nYou know, calling folks like me to visit his school\nand serve as coaches![VAR 0114(0025)]
And there I’d gone, getting ahead of myself\nthinking I needed to start some sort of\r\neducational reform!\c\nMy, it’s a bit embarrassing now that I know better.[VAR 0114(0025)]
I may not have a lot of takers yet for my math\nclass, but I’ll keep it up and grow our numbers!\c\nPut in a good word for me with your friends here,\nwon’t you, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0025)]
I’ve got to admit, getting off the warpath has\nsomehow taken the wind from my sails.[VAR 0114(0025)]
I need some new excitement to really pick up my\nmood again.[VAR 0114(0025)]
Oh, I know! How about you and I do a Pokémon\ntrade, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0025)]
There’s nothing to be lost in asking, right? Haha!\c\nI’ll offer up a Rockruff. What do you say to that,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]? Anything for me?[VAR 0114(0025)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]This [VAR 0101(0001)] is just the ticket! I feel\nbetter\r\nalready!\c\nThank you for the trade. I’ll be sure to treasure\nyour [VAR 0101(0001)] and raise it with care.[VAR 0114(0025)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]So you’ll trade your [VAR 0101(0001)] for my\nRockruff,\r\n[VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0025)]
You can’t trade Ms. Tyme a Pokémon if you aren’t\nits original Trainer!
You can’t trade Ms. Tyme such a rare Pokémon!
You can’t trade Ms. Tyme a Shiny Pokémon!
Oh no! You’ve only got one Pokémon with you\nin your party.\c\nYou’ve got to have at least two, or I couldn’t\npossibly trade with you.[VAR 0114(0025)]
Oh, my. You don’t want to trade? That’s a real\nshame to hear.[VAR 0114(0025)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Oh, [VAR 0100(0000)]! Have you\ndecided\r\nyou\r\nwould\r\nlike\r\nto\r\ntrade\r\nwith\r\nme\r\nafter all?[VAR 0114(0025)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Oh, my. [VAR 0100(0000)] again?\nPerhaps\r\nyou’re\r\nhoping\r\nfor\r\na battle?[VAR 0114(0025)]
Let’s pencil in a chat for later, then.[VAR 0114(0025)]
Well, I’d be delighted to square off against you!\nBut don’t go too hard on me, all right?[VAR 0114(0025)]
[~ 65]
[VAR BD06(0000)][VAR 0100(0000)], that was great! You\nreally\r\ndo\r\nhave\r\nformidable\r\nbattle\r\nskills.[VAR 0114(0025)]
I don’t know that I would have been able to beat\nyou even when I was at my peak.[VAR 0114(0025)]
How about a little reward from your teacher?[VAR 0114(0025)]
I’d be delighted if those came in handy for you\non all your many adventures.[VAR 0114(0025)]
[~ 65]
You know, seeing you battle reminds me of my\ndays as a Gym Leader.[VAR 0114(0025)]
We should do this again sometime. As the kids\nsay, battling you really “rocks”![VAR 0114(0025)]
Oh, perhaps it’s still a bit early to put me out to\npasture, hmm?\c\nThank you for the battle. It was a great deal of\nfun to face you![VAR 0114(0025)]
I wonder if the number of Rock-type users would\nincrease in the future if I were to teach the\r\nstudents here their true appeal?[VAR 0114(0025)]
They use a special currency called BP here at\nBlueberry Academy, don’t they?\c\nI bet I could use that when devising new math\nproblems to pose...[VAR 0114(0025)]
Someone came up to me asking for an autograph\nbecause they thought I was my sister!\c\nI know we’re related, but to me, Ryme and I\ndon’t look at all alike...[VAR 0114(0025)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]That [VAR 0101(0001)] of yours has been a\nperfect\r\ndelight,\r\n[VAR 0100(0000)].\c\nIt’s always catching a ride on my Garganacl’s\nshoulder and looking quite pleased with itself![VAR 0114(0025)]
How is that Rockruff I traded you getting on?\c\nIt’s an unusual Pokémon, able to claim different\nforms depending on the time of day it evolves.[VAR 0114(0025)]

So, Penny! How’d you wind up friends with\n[VAR 0100(0000)], anyway?[VAR 0114(0004)]
Huh? Well, uh... I guess [VAR 1100(00FF,0100)]she just really came\nthrough for me when I needed h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]imer.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Everything was going off the rails. School was a\nmess, and my friendships...well, ditto.[VAR 0114(0008)]
[VAR 0100(0000)] was a big help getting\nall that sorted out.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Guau! So [VAR 1100(00FF,0100)]she helped you out too while [VAR 1100(00FF,0100)]she was\ntackling all the Gyms? That’s awesome![VAR 0114(0004)]
What about you then, Nemona?[VAR 0114(0008)]
[VAR 0100(0000)] and I are classmates!\nNeighbors back home, too![VAR 0114(0004)]
Plus, I said [VAR 1100(00FF,0100)]she should aim to be a Champion,\nand [VAR 1100(00FF,0100)]she did it! So now I’ve got a Champion bud![VAR 0114(0004)]
Wait, what?! That’s wild...[VAR 0114(0008)]
Hold it right there, you two.[VAR 0114(0006)]

They’re nothing compared to what me and h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]imer\nwent through! Our friendship’s on another level![VAR 0114(0006)]

Hey, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0006)]
I came as quickly as I could—like I’d do any less\nfor my best friend in the whole world![VAR 0114(0006)]
To be honest, I sorta just came ’cause it was you\nwho called and all, but...man, look at this place!\r\nBlueberry Academy is something else![VAR 0114(0006)]
Their classes are all battle focused, right? It’s like\na whole day full of our old battle studies classes![VAR 0114(0006)]
I’m sure Nemona would love to have gone to\nschool in a place like this, but I’d miss having\r\npractical classes like home ec and stuff...[VAR 0114(0006)]
If you had to choose just one subject, which do\nyou think you’d pick? Battle studies or home ec?[VAR 0114(0006)]
Battle studies!
Home ec!
Ah. Yeah, guess that checks out. You’re the\nstrongest little Champ—you even beat Nemona,\r\nafter all...[VAR 0114(0006)]
Yes! Knew we were two peas in a little pod, bud!\c\nHome ec has so many good things to teach you!\nTry hard, and you can make the best sandwiches![VAR 0114(0006)]
Actually, Director Clavell was telling me that if I\ndo some studying while I’m here, I’ll be able to\r\nget some extra credits for our school back home.[VAR 0114(0006)]
I’d sorta fallen behind on that front, so I’m gonna\nwork hard and rack up those credits![VAR 0114(0006)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Yo, [VAR 0100(0000)]. Just the person I\nwas\r\nhoping\r\nto\r\ntalk to...[VAR 0114(0006)]
See, I’ve noticed that folks here aren’t really\nabout the picnic and sandwich life. Is that stuff\r\nnot a big deal here?[VAR 0114(0006)]
You think it isn’t?!
I’m pretty sure it is...
What’s that? You made a super-spicy sandwich\nfor one of the Elite Four?[VAR 0114(0006)]
Maybe...maybe I’m wrong, then, about people\nhere not caring about sandwiches![VAR 0114(0006)]
See, the thing is, I was whipping up a snack in\nthat Terarium place earlier, and these Blueberry\r\nkids all gathered round to watch...[VAR 0114(0006)]
They were all staring like they’d never seen\nanything like it! It was super embarrassing...[VAR 0114(0006)]
I was so flustered I ended up just making ’em all\nsandwiches to eat too...[VAR 0114(0006)]
That sounds nice!
You’re sweet, Arven
It wasn’t nice at all! It was a total hassle!\c\nOh... I guess you mean for the kids who got to\neat the sandwiches? Sure, nice for THEM![VAR 0114(0006)]
Wha—! A-am not! I’m completely sour! I just\ncouldn’t stand the pressure of all those eyes![VAR 0114(0006)]
But if it’s not that unusual to make sandwiches\naround here, then why’d they all stare like that?[VAR 0114(0006)]
Man, I don’t know if I’m cut out for this place...[VAR 0114(0006)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Oh! [VAR 0100(0000)]! I got an update\nfor you![VAR 0114(0006)]
I solved the mystery of why your bud Arven was\ngetting mobbed by those Blueberry kids![VAR 0114(0006)]
So, apparently, the real reason they were all\nstaring was...a case of mistaken identity![VAR 0114(0006)]
How’d that come about?
Who’d they think you were?
I don’t really know, myself...[VAR 0114(0006)]
I guess some guy shows up in the Terarium every\nso often and gives away super-spicy sandwiches?\r\nAnd they all thought I was him?[VAR 0114(0006)]
That’s why they were all being so weird, watching\nme with...expectation, or whatever, in their eyes.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Who is this mystery fellow that just gives away\nsandwiches from time to time? I hear they even\r\ncall him “the spiciest of souls”![VAR 0114(0006)]
I might have an idea!
Boy, I wonder...
You know him?! I guess there are all sorts of\nweird characters at this school, too![VAR 0114(0006)]
Man, I’ll never solve this mystery! There must be\nsome weird characters at this school![VAR 0114(0006)]
Speaking of weird characters and all...I’ve got a\nreal character I wanted to show you![VAR 0114(0006)]
See, this Skwovet I’ve got has a pretty unusual\nAbility...[VAR 0114(0006)]
So I figured this’d be a good excuse for you and\nme to trade Pokémon! How ’bout it?[VAR 0114(0006)]
All right! Then I’ll offer up that Skwovet to you.\nWho’ll you go with, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0006)]
[VAR BD06(0000)][VAR 0101(0001)]’s a good call! Figures you’d\ngo\r\nwith\r\na\r\nchoice\r\nlike\r\nthat.\c\nI’ll be sure to take real good care of it and make\nsure it’s happy, along with Mabosstiff and all![VAR 0114(0006)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]You good to go forward with trading your\n[VAR 0101(0001)]\r\nfor\r\nmy\r\nSkwovet?[VAR 0114(0006)]
You can’t trade Arven a Pokémon if you aren’t\nits original Trainer!
You can’t trade Arven such a rare Pokémon!
You can’t trade Arven a Shiny Pokémon!
Oh, wait—we can’t trade if you’ve only got one\nPokémon with you. C’mon, bud, you know that!\r\nBring at least two little guys with you next time![VAR 0114(0006)]
Oh? No good right now, huh? Well, get yourself\nprepped and come back![VAR 0114(0006)]
Yo! You ready for that trade now?![VAR 0114(0006)]
Mabosstiff’s been beggin’ me for another chance\nto battle you, you know. What do you say, bud?[VAR 0114(0006)]
Yeah, you must be busy, huh... I get that!\c\nDon’t you worry. I’ll make sure Mabosstiff\nunderstands why it’s a no this time.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Yesss! That’s my best bud! I’m so ready for this![VAR 0114(0006)]
[~ 69]
Sheesh, you’re a little menace in battle, like\nusual![VAR 0114(0006)]
I tried training up my team so that we wouldn’t\nlose to you again, but no dice![VAR 0114(0006)]
Oh, and I just remembered—I found these funny\nphone cases at the airport...so I bought ’em![VAR 0114(0006)]
I thought of you the moment I saw them!\nSo there—a little present for a great battle![VAR 0114(0006)]
You received a set of [VAR FF00(0008)]Sandwich Cases [VAR FF00(0000)]from\nArven!
We might’ve lost, but I’d say Mabosstiff looks\nreal satisfied![VAR 0114(0006)]
Thanks for the battle, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0006)]
Whoa, no way! Did I actually luck out and get a\nwin on you?! Well, I’ll be a Mankey’s uncle![VAR 0114(0006)]
I sure was shocked to see Toedscool swimming\nout in the sea in that Terarium dome!\c\nI guess they aren’t really Toedscool, but some\nother Pokémon—still, what a resemblance![VAR 0114(0006)]
That flower petal ice cream they had in Kitakami\nwas a real treat, huh?\c\nThough the Academy Pizza they serve in the\ncafeteria here is real good too![VAR 0114(0006)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Your mom’s cooking was awesome,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nYou gotta let me try a sandwich you made\nsometime, too![VAR 0114(0006)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]That [VAR 0101(0001)] of yours is always\nplaying\r\nwith\r\nol’\r\nMabosstiff\r\nand\r\nteasing\r\nhim.\c\nThanks for trading me such a little sweetie![VAR 0114(0006)]
My Greedent just rolled up one day holding a\nPokémon Egg, y’know?\c\nAnd that gluttonous Skwovet I traded you is the\nPokémon that hatched from that Egg![VAR 0114(0006)]

Ready to go photograph some Pokémon and\nsurvey the forest for me?[VAR 0114(0046)]
Reporting for survey duty!
Maybe another time...
Then let’s hang in the tent until the weather gets\nnice and foggy.[VAR 0114(0046)]
Looks like this is about as good as it’s gonna get.\nAll right, partner! Get out there and survey![VAR 0114(0046)]
Took a new photo? Lemme see...[VAR 0114(0046)]
That’s the Imitation Pokémon, Sudowoodo! It’s\nreal easy to mistake it for a tree in this fog.[VAR 0114(0046)]
The Candle Pokémon, Litwick! Seeing those little\nlights floating in the dark is otherworldly, huh?[VAR 0114(0046)]
The Calm Pokémon, Hatenna, huh? Must feel\nright at home in a quiet forest like this.[VAR 0114(0046)]
It’s the Rock Pokémon, Geodude! You’ve gotta\nbe careful, or you might trip over this fella![VAR 0114(0046)]
That’s the Toxic Lizard Pokémon, Salandit, right?\nSneaking up on some prey in the dark, maybe?[VAR 0114(0046)]
The Stag Beetle Pokémon, Vikavolt! Those huge\njaws it has make for a real killer photo![VAR 0114(0046)]
The Firefly Pokémon, Illumise! Word has it that it\ngets along real well with Volbeat.[VAR 0114(0046)]
That’s the Acorn Pokémon, Seedot...right?! Pretty\neasy to mistake it for a Berry or something![VAR 0114(0046)]
That’s the String Spit Pokémon, Spinarak! Do you\nthink it’s trying to spin up a new web in the trees?[VAR 0114(0046)]
The Cheeky Pokémon, Skwovet! What would you\nbet it’s looking for food from up in the trees?[VAR 0114(0046)]
The Water Weed Pokémon, Lotad! Now that’s\nthe good life, just floating around like that...[VAR 0114(0046)]
The EleFish Pokémon, Tynamo! You’ve got a real\nknack for this, spotting something so tiny![VAR 0114(0046)]
The Firefly Pokémon, Volbeat, huh? I heard it can\ndraw shapes using the light on its rear end![VAR 0114(0046)]
The Requiem Pokémon, Duskull... It makes quite\nthe impression on a dark night like this![VAR 0114(0046)]
The Owl Pokémon, Hoothoot! I’ve always wanted\nto get a shot of it switching the foot it stands on.[VAR 0114(0046)]
You got both the Firefly Pokémon, Volbeat and\nIllumise! They look so good together. Great shot![VAR 0114(0046)]
The Firefly Pokémon, Illumise! I bet that Volbeat\nshowed up just to be with it, huh?[VAR 0114(0046)]
The Firefly Pokémon, Volbeat! I bet that Illumise\nshowed up just to be with it, huh?[VAR 0114(0046)]
This is great! I knew you were the right person\nfor the job![VAR 0114(0046)]
You really do take great photos, partner!\c\nHave you tried turning your eyes upward, too?\nThere may be Pokémon lurking up in the trees...[VAR 0114(0046)]
You have a real eye for photography, partner!\c\nI bet you could even get great shots of Pokémon\nthat refuse to sit still and always wander around![VAR 0114(0046)]
That’s my partner for you!\c\nYou know, I bet there could be Pokémon in caves\nnearby too. You could probably snap some shots![VAR 0114(0046)]
You’ve got a real knack for this sort of thing!\c\nI bet getting those Pokémon that hang near the\nwater in the northwest part of the forest would\r\nbe a walk in the park for someone like you![VAR 0114(0046)]
Nice... You’ve done some real fine work here!\c\nOh, one tip from me? Watch your footing when\nyou get to that area with all the rocks—I tripped\r\nand nearly faceplanted in the dark![VAR 0114(0046)]
So it looks like you’ve got a real good handle on\nhow to take photos by now, huh?\c\nI bet you even know that some Pokémon are so\nwary they’ll run if you get too close! You’ve gotta\r\nbe careful if you wanna catch them on film![VAR 0114(0046)]
You are getting all kinds of different Pokémon\nin your photos!\c\nIt can be tricky—like with Ghost-type Pokémon!\nSnapping a photo of one before it disappears\r\nrequires a quick shutter finger![VAR 0114(0046)]
Mm-hmm! You’re getting real practiced at\ncatching Pokémon out and about their daily lives.\c\nI’d guess you could even catch Pokémon up in\nthe trees searching for their next meal![VAR 0114(0046)]
Just what I’ve come to expect of my partner!\nYour photos really showcase your good taste!\c\nOh, and did you hear that sound coming from the\nnortheast? Like thunder or something? I wonder\r\nif it could be Electric-type Pokémon...[VAR 0114(0046)]
The composition! The motifs! I think your skills\nare wasted here in the backwater, helping me.\c\nOh, but before you abandon me...have you\nbeen up around the water in the northwest?[VAR 0114(0046)]
I bet there are still some more Pokémon hiding in\nthe forest you haven’t photographed yet...[VAR 0114(0046)]
Well, keep up the good work! I’ve got nothing\nbut high hopes for you, partner![VAR 0114(0046)]
Just one more Pokémon and your survey work\nwill be complete! Keep it up, partner![VAR 0114(0046)]
Huh...? Wait, this picture doesn’t contain a single\nPokémon, does it?![VAR 0114(0046)]
Ummm... Yeah, I’m not sure the machine will be\nable to process this without a clearer shot...[VAR 0114(0046)]
Nothing new to see here! Try looking for\nPokémon you haven’t photographed yet![VAR 0114(0046)]
Hmm... Yeah, I don’t think the machine can get\nmuch from images so small. Can’t you get closer?[VAR 0114(0046)]
Hmm... Looks like the machine can’t use your\nphoto data.\c\nI guess it’s too hard to get a clear reading when\na Pokémon is in the process of running away?[VAR 0114(0046)]
And with that, you’ve completed your survey!\nWell done, partner![VAR 0114(0046)]
Do you want to end your survey early?
End it now
Keep going
Okay, let’s call it! We’re all done for tonight!
[~ 62]
Probably best not to ride on [VAR 1107(00FF,0202)]KoMiraidon if the aim\nis to sneak up on Pokémon...
Get Those Photos!
Open Camera
End Survey
How’s the survey coming along, partner?[VAR 0114(0046)]
Huh? What’s this? You got a shot of me?[VAR 0114(0046)]
Heh heh! Did you get a good shot? Hope I didn’t\nlook too stiff or anything![VAR 0114(0046)]
Wow, I’m not used to being on the other side of\na lens. It’s kind of awkward...[VAR 0114(0046)]
Gah! Stop, stop, stop! Now I’m all self-conscious\nand can’t look natural! It’s embarrassing![VAR 0114(0046)]
...OK, for real—I’m not your subject! Take photos\nof Pokémon already, would you![VAR 0114(0046)]
It’s hard to get a good shot crouched down low...
Wa-wow!
Aw, you took Growlithe for me? You sweetie!\c\nI mean, sure, it’s no help at all for the survey,\nbut I still love to see his photos![VAR 0114(0046)]

[~ 69]
[~ 69]
[VAR 0100(0000)]! Welcome back![VAR 0114(0049)]
How was that trip you took with Kieran and the\nothers?[VAR 0114(0049)]
It was a piece of cake!
It was such a headache!
I bet the group had everything wrapped up neat\nas a bow in no time, with you there![VAR 0114(0049)]
Oh, I’m sure it was! Thank you for all the help\nyou must have provided.[VAR 0114(0049)]
You were investigating that huge crater in the\nPaldea region, weren’t you?[VAR 0114(0049)]
To think, you came here to study abroad...and\nthen we sent you right back to Paldea!\c\nThat wasn’t very well done, was it?[VAR 0114(0049)]
It was fine!
I guess not...
Oh, you’re so understanding... If it were me, I\nwould’ve been grumbling the whole time![VAR 0114(0049)]
Right! I knew you’d agree! That sort of thing...\nIt’s just not right![VAR 0114(0049)]
Sometimes this school is a bit too permissive\nabout things...[VAR 0114(0049)]
Which is why we all have a duty to say loud and\nclear when we think something isn’t right![VAR 0114(0049)]
Oh! Do you happen to have a little time to spare,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0049)]
I wanted to catch you up on the League Club\nlatest. You missed a little while you were away.[VAR 0114(0049)]
For one thing, we decided to put a temporary\nhalt to any rank changes in the BB League!\r\nHopefully, that’ll help prevent more confusion.[VAR 0114(0049)]
We also officially wrote into the rules that even\nvisiting students can be Champion![VAR 0114(0049)]
And we reviewed all the club rules that Kieran\nhad changed to make too strict. We’ve rolled\r\nthem back to what they used to be.[VAR 0114(0049)]
Plus some other little odds and ends! My, we\nput ourselves up to a lot, didn’t we?[VAR 0114(0049)]
Thanks for the hard work!
You certainly did!
Oh! Sorry, no—I wasn’t fishing for compliments or\nanything![VAR 0114(0049)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Forget I said anything,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]!\r\nWe\r\nwere\r\njust\r\ndoing\r\nour\r\njob![VAR 0114(0049)]
Though not that Drayton, of course. He was\nsleeping through the whole meeting. Sleeping!\r\nCan you believe that?![VAR 0114(0049)]
Anyway! That’s all I had to report! You are now\nall caught up on the recent club happenings![VAR 0114(0049)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Do you have time for a quick chat,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0049)]
You see, things got quite strained in the club\nwhile Kieran was Champion...[VAR 0114(0049)]
We had quite a few people quit because it\nsimply stopped being fun for them.[VAR 0114(0049)]
Which is why I’d like you to decide on a new\ndirection for the club, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0049)]
What do you think we should focus on?[VAR 0114(0049)]
Having fun and working hard!
Enjoying ourselves together!
I guess I’d say...“safety first”!
Having fun and working hard... Yes, I think that\nwould be a fine idea![VAR 0114(0049)]
Enjoying ourselves together... Yes, I think that\nwould be a fine idea![VAR 0114(0049)]
Safety first...? Hmm, it makes me think we’re\ngoing to work at a construction site or something.\r\nBut I suppose it IS important to stay safe![VAR 0114(0049)]
With this, we’ll be able to make the club a lovely\nplace for everyone again. Thank you so much![VAR 0114(0049)]
I think we’ve taken care of all the lingering tasks\nI had for the club![VAR 0114(0049)]
Phew, I’m plumb tuckered out... I think I need to\nsoothe these tired feelings away by sharing\r\nsome cuteness...[VAR 0114(0049)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]wiiith...you, [VAR 0100(0000)]! What do\nyou\r\nsay?\r\nWill\r\nyou\r\ntrade\r\nPokémon\r\nwith me?[VAR 0114(0049)]
Splendid! I’ll send you an adorable Snubbull.\nWhat will you send, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0049)]
[VAR BD06(0000)][VAR 0101(0001)] is just the cutest!\nWhat\r\na choice!\c\nThank you so much for trading with me![VAR 0114(0049)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Just to be sure, [VAR 0100(0000)],\nyou’re\r\nhappy\r\nto\r\ntrade\r\nyour\r\n[VAR 0101(0001)]\r\nfor\r\nmy\r\nSnubbull?[VAR 0114(0049)]
You can’t trade Lacey a Pokémon if you aren’t its\noriginal Trainer!
You can’t trade Lacey such a rare Pokémon!
You can’t trade Lacey a Shiny Pokémon!
Wait—we can hardly trade if you’ve only got\nONE Pokémon in your party, silly!\c\nPlease come back with at least two, OK?[VAR 0114(0049)]
Oh, you don’t want to make the trade? That’s\nquite the letdown...[VAR 0114(0049)]
[VAR BD06(0000)][VAR 0100(0000)]! How about it? Ready\nto trade?[VAR 0114(0049)]
[VAR BD06(0000)][VAR 0100(0000)]! Would you care for\na battle?[VAR 0114(0049)]
Well, I’ll be here if you ever change your mind![VAR 0114(0049)]
I’ll show you the strength of cuteness all\nover again![VAR 0114(0049)]
Now, you know that we always do Double\nBattles here at Blueberry Academy!\c\nYou’ve got to have at least two Pokémon with\nyou to take part.
You’re as strong as ever! And oh so cute![VAR 0114(0049)]
You’ve given me so many adorable memories to\ncherish that I want to give you something back...[VAR 0114(0049)]
How about one of the smartphone cases we\nmade in the League Club?[VAR 0114(0049)]
Feel free to put it on your phone, if you like![VAR 0114(0049)]
You received a [VAR FF00(0008)]Blueberry Case (White) [VAR FF00(0000)]from\nLacey!
That was a great battle! Here, I feel like you\ndeserve something for your efforts![VAR 0114(0049)]
Ahhh, I got to see so many cute things today.\nI’m definitely satisfied![VAR 0114(0049)]
It doesn’t matter who won or who lost—it was\nstill a battle bursting with cuteness!\c\nLet’s give all our Pokémon a nice round of\napplause for their efforts![VAR 0114(0049)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Why is Drayton so...Drayton? You know?!\nHe’s just so slovenly and unreliable and...ugh!\c\nYou should say something,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]!\r\nMaybe\r\nthat\r\nblockhead\r\nwill\r\nactually\r\nlisten\r\nto you![VAR 0114(0049)]
Kieran changed a whole lot after he decided to\nmix up his look. His personality took a nose dive,\r\nbut he looked darn cute...don’t you think?[VAR 0114(0049)]
My daddy’s a Gym Leader, you know, and he’s\nawfully scary-looking.\c\nSo much so that boys tend to run the other way\nwhen they learn I’m his daughter.[VAR 0114(0049)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]That [VAR 0101(0001)] you gave me is still just\nas\r\ncute\r\nas\r\nanything,\r\n[VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0049)]
That Snubbull I traded you isn’t causing you any\ntrouble by being too darn cute, is he?\c\nOh, and if you raise him up to be a Granbull, you\nshould try using his belly as a pillow sometime![VAR 0114(0049)]

[VAR BD06(0000)]Hey, [VAR 0100(0000)]! There’s\nsomething\r\nI\r\nwanted\r\nto\r\ntell\r\nyou![VAR 0114(0047)]
That match against Kieran—it was totally at max\nheat! You were seriously cookin’![VAR 0114(0047)]
I still can’t believe what I saw—Kieran had been\nundefeated since he came back from Kitakami,\r\nbut you floored him just like that![VAR 0114(0047)]
No wonder the whole BB League’s blazing with\nexcitement now![VAR 0114(0047)]
But now that you’ve become Champion, that\nmeans Kieran gets bumped down to being one\r\nof the Elite Four...[VAR 0114(0047)]
So the weakest Elite Four member’s gotta move\nout to make room. Unfortunately, that means me![VAR 0114(0047)]
Oh, really?
Sorry about that!
Yeah, it kinda sucks, but those’re the rules!\nNothing you or I can do, really![VAR 0114(0047)]
’Sides, the League Club’s back to the way it used\nto be. I prefer it this way![VAR 0114(0047)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]And it’s all thanks to you,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]!\r\nSo\r\nthank\r\nyou,\r\nstraight\r\nfrom\r\nthe\r\nchef’s\r\nmouth,\r\nso\r\nto speak![VAR 0114(0047)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Hey, [VAR 0100(0000)]! D’you like\ncooking?![VAR 0114(0047)]
I love it!
Not really
You like it that much, eh? Nice!\c\nGuess that explains how you made that\nsuper-spicy sandwich so easily![VAR 0114(0047)]
Really?!\c\nYou’re not that into cooking and you still\nmanaged to whip up a super-spicy sandwich?![VAR 0114(0047)]
Me, I just love cooking! Guess one look at my\nfrying pan gives that away, huh?[VAR 0114(0047)]
My parents run a little restaurant, y’see. Once I\nfinish school, I wanna take over the business![VAR 0114(0047)]
Heck, the only reason I’m in this academy is\n’cause the director recruited me![VAR 0114(0047)]
So during this whole drama, watching Kieran\nand Drayton kinda shocked me...[VAR 0114(0047)]
They really went blazing hot in their battles,\ndidn’t they? Enough to burn you![VAR 0114(0047)]
I never thought I’d see anyone get so fired up for\nPokémon battles, but I guess I was wrong![VAR 0114(0047)]
Made me think maybe I should turn up the heat\na little bit myself, y’know?[VAR 0114(0047)]
Hey, [VAR 0100(0000)]! Listen to this![VAR 0114(0047)]
Turns out I get to stay in the Elite Four![VAR 0114(0047)]
That’s great!
How come?
Yeah, good news! ...I guess?[VAR 0114(0047)]
That’s a great question! I’m not sure myself![VAR 0114(0047)]
I was told something about Kieran going on a\nbreak from school and stuff...[VAR 0114(0047)]
so all ranking changes for the BB League are on\nhold—or something like that![VAR 0114(0047)]
Lacey tried explaining it, but it was way too\ncomplicated for me. I forget what she said![VAR 0114(0047)]
It’s my lucky day, though. Getting to use the\nplaza space as my home base is a nice perk![VAR 0114(0047)]
Oops, sorry... I just blab whatever’s on my mind\nto you, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0047)]
I was thinking—our friendship could use a little\nseasoning![VAR 0114(0047)]
How’d you like to trade Pokémon with me?![VAR 0114(0047)]
Yeeeaaah, now we’re cooking with gas! I think I’ll\nserve up a Magby! Whatcha got for me?[VAR 0114(0047)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Oooh, I bet [VAR 0101(0001)] would make a\ngreat\r\nsous-chef!\r\nThanks\r\na\r\nbunch!\c\nI’ll take real good care of it, promise![VAR 0114(0047)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Ready to trade your [VAR 0101(0001)] for my\nMagby?[VAR 0114(0047)]
You can’t trade Crispin a Pokémon if you aren’t\nits original Trainer!
You can’t trade Crispin such a rare Pokémon!
You can’t trade Crispin a Shiny Pokémon!
Hold on a sec. I don’t think you’re allowed to\ntrade if you only have one Pokémon with you!\c\nCome back when you have at least two, and then\nwe can get cooking![VAR 0114(0047)]
Aw, c’mon! Don’t be such a wet blanket![VAR 0114(0047)]
[VAR BD06(0000)][VAR 0100(0000)]! Hey,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]!\r\nC’mon,\r\nlet’s\r\ntrade\r\nPokémon![VAR 0114(0047)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Hey, perfect timing, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nHow\r\nabout\r\na\r\nblazing\r\nbattle\r\nagainst\r\nyour\r\npal\r\nCrispin?[VAR 0114(0047)]
Aw, c’mon! Don’t leave me smoldering![VAR 0114(0047)]
Sweet! Just the answer to get my fire started![VAR 0114(0047)]
Hey, I can only do Double Battles! Bring at least\ntwo Pokémon, would you?[VAR 0114(0047)]
Wooo! Now that’s what I call a battle at\nmaximum firepower![VAR 0114(0047)]
I got way more fired up than in our BB League\nbattle![VAR 0114(0047)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Here you go, [VAR 0100(0000)]! Thanks\nfor\r\nthe\r\ngood\r\ntime![VAR 0114(0047)]
Make a whole bunch of super-spicy sandwiches\nwith those, OK?[VAR 0114(0047)]
[~ 64]
Oof, burnt to a crisp! Here’s something as a\npalate cleanser![VAR 0114(0047)]
Come back for seconds any time, OK?[VAR 0114(0047)]
Hey, wait a sec. Did I just win? I think I just won!\nTalk about satisfying![VAR 0114(0047)]
I carry around my frying pan so I can fry up\nsomethin’ whenever I want!\c\nAnd I can also use it to defend myself if I get\nattacked![VAR 0114(0047)]
I wonder if Lacey has someone she likes?\nShe...she hasn’t mentioned anything about that\r\nkinda thing to you, has she?[VAR 0114(0047)]
To make sure my dishes are spicy enough, I\nalways think about whether they’d satisfy the\r\nspiciest of souls![VAR 0114(0047)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]The [VAR 0101(0001)] you traded me is doing\njust\r\ngreat!\r\nIt’s\r\neating\r\ntons\r\nof\r\nmy\r\ncooking![VAR 0114(0047)]
You can evolve Magby into Magmar, then trade it\nwhile it’s holding a Magmarizer to evolve it into\r\nMagmortar![VAR 0114(0047)]

Hello? This is Saffron.[VAR 0114(0054)]
You have my thanks for inviting so many talented\npeople to Blueberry Academy.[VAR 0114(0054)]
I think you’ve earned yourself a special gift![VAR 0114(0054)]
Let’s see... How about the right to challenge\nthe academy’s [VAR FF00(0006)]secret boss[VAR FF00(0000)] to a battle?[VAR 0114(0054)]
Swing by the academy entrance, why don’t you?[VAR 0114(0054)]
He’ll be waiting for you there. Anyway, talk to\nyou later![VAR 0114(0054)]
Huh? Well, hello, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(002C)]
What’re you doing here? Waiting for someone?[VAR 0114(004B)]
Yeah, the secret boss...
I was told to come here...
Oh, I gotcha![VAR 0114(004B)]
Well, spoiler alert... As it turns out...[VAR 0114(004B)]
Saffron was me! This whole time![VAR 0114(004B)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]You really breathed life into this academy,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nThe clubs, the students—you name it! Everyone’s\nhaving the most fulfilling school life ever![VAR 0114(004B)]
As director, I am sincerely grateful. I take my\nhat off to you.[VAR 0114(004B)]
But y’see, I’m not just the director of Blueberry\nAcademy...[VAR 0114(004B)]
As the strongest Trainer here, I’m also the secret\nboss of this fine institution![VAR 0114(004B)]
The BB League Champion is what you’d call the\n“main” boss. But it’s more fun if there’s a secret\r\nboss that’s stronger, isn’t it?[VAR 0114(004B)]
I think you and I can have a real blast of a battle![VAR 0114(004B)]
No time to waste—let’s get this started.[VAR 0114(004B)]
I’m not going to hold back, OK? Try to hang in\nthere![VAR 0114(004B)]

Hold on, though... The BB League Champion just\ndefeated the secret boss, which means...[VAR 0114(004B)]
That makes you the...Blueberry King? How do\nyou fancy that name?[VAR 0114(004B)]
That makes you the...Blueberry Queen? How do\nyou fancy that name?[VAR 0114(004B)]
I like the sound of that!
Uh, what are my other options?
We’ll decide on a proper title later! For now, let\nme offer you my congratulations![VAR 0114(004B)]
I think you deserve a special reward for defeating\nthe secret boss![VAR 0114(004B)]
This is such a splendid occasion, though. I feel\nlike I should give you something more...[VAR 0114(004B)]
Oh, I know! How about we trade Pokémon?[VAR 0114(004B)]
I’ll trade my Blitzle—what do you say?[VAR 0114(004B)]
Any Pokémon from you is more than welcome to\ncome with me![VAR 0114(004B)]
[VAR BD06(0000)][VAR 1303(0001,0000)][VAR 0101(0001)]... Yeah, I like it!\nThanks\r\nso\r\nmuch!\c\nThe Blitzle I gave you is rather special, you know.\nIts coloring is pretty rare, so take good care of it![VAR 0114(004B)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]So you’re OK with trading your [VAR 0101(0001)]\nfor\r\nmy\r\nBlitzle?[VAR 0114(004B)]
You can’t trade Director Cyrano a Pokémon if\nyou aren’t its original Trainer!
You can’t trade Director Cyrano such a rare\nPokémon!
You can’t trade Director Cyrano a Shiny\nPokémon!
Wait a minute, I forgot that you only had one\nPokémon with you...\c\nThat does make your victory really impressive,\nbut you still need at least two Pokémon to trade![VAR 0114(004B)]
Whenever you’re ready for a trade, just give me\na call—and beat me again![VAR 0114(004B)]
Well, I’ll see you round![VAR 0114(004B)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Hi there, [VAR 0100(0000)]! I take it you\nwant\r\nanother\r\nbattle?[VAR 0114(004B)]
Then just come on over to the academy entrance![VAR 0114(004B)]
Theeere’s the Blueberry King![VAR 0114(004B)]
Theeere’s the Blueberry Queen![VAR 0114(004B)]
No time to waste—let’s get this started.[VAR 0114(004B)]
I’m going all out for the win—try to keep up![VAR 0114(004B)]
Guess I’m the strongest! Maybe I should take up\nthe title of Blueberry King...[VAR 0114(004B)]
Give me a call whenever you want another battle![VAR 0114(004B)]
Whew, that was a blast! You really are strong,\naren’t you?[VAR 0114(004B)]
Here’s a little prize for defeating me again![VAR 0114(004B)]
Oh, I almost forgot! We haven’t traded Pokémon\nyet, have we?[VAR 0114(004B)]
Well, I’ll see you round![VAR 0114(004B)]

[VAR BD06(0000)]There you are, [VAR 0100(0000)]! Just\nthe\r\nperson\r\nI\r\nwas\r\nlooking\r\nfor![VAR 0114(004B)]
I heard the news—you’re the new BB League\nChampion, am I right?![VAR 0114(004B)]
I’ll admit it—I’m blown away!\c\nInviting you to this academy was the best\ndecision I’ve made recently![VAR 0114(004B)]
So, now that you’ve had some time to get\ncomfortable here...\c\nHow do you find Blueberry Academy? Are you\nhaving fun?[VAR 0114(004B)]
I love it here!
So-so, I guess
Good, good. Just what I like to hear.[VAR 0114(004B)]
So-so, eh? I’m sure you mean it’s so, soooooo\ngreat, right?[VAR 0114(004B)]
Anyway, there’s a small favor I’d like to ask of\nyou, [VAR 0100(0000)]...[VAR 0114(004B)]
Y’see, the whole academy’s become so much\nmore lively and energetic since you came here.[VAR 0114(004B)]
And that got me thinking—maybe we should have\neven MORE people come visit from Paldea! Have\r\nthem come as [VAR FF00(0006)]special coaches[VAR FF00(0000)] or something![VAR 0114(004B)]
You know a lot of people, right? You’ve got lots\nof friends and everything?[VAR 0114(004B)]
I mean, like, teachers from your school, Gym\nLeaders—that sort of thing! Oh, and any strong\r\nfriends of yours are also welcome here![VAR 0114(004B)]
Leave it to me!
Uhhh...
Spoken like a true Champion! I knew you were\nthe right person to ask![VAR 0114(004B)]
Wow! Already thinking about who you can call,\nhuh? I knew you were the right one to ask![VAR 0114(004B)]
You can use the clubroom computer to contact\nanyone you want to invite![VAR 0114(004B)]
Oh, but it’ll cost BP—we’ll need to pay for their\ntrip and such. Here’s some to get you started.[VAR 0114(004B)]
You received 200 BP from Director Cyrano!
I think I’ll arrange for the special coaches to stay\nin this clubroom when they’re not teaching. You\r\nshould have a chat with them while they’re here![VAR 0114(004B)]
Now then, I’ll leave it to you! Enjoy![VAR 0114(004B)]

Osu! Let’s do this![VAR 0114(0024)]
It’s the one, the only, the hot-blooded Dendra!\nLet’s set our fighting spirits ablaze—together![VAR 0114(0024)]
Osu, new kid! So you’re the one who invited me\nhere, huh?[VAR 0114(0024)]
A new challenge, in a new place... I’m all pumped\nup and ready to get going![VAR 0114(0024)]
But there must be a reason why you chose me\nof all people to come all the way out here![VAR 0114(0024)]
Go on then—what d’ya need from me, new kid?![VAR 0114(0024)]
I wanna see that hot-bloodedness!
I’d like for you to impart some wisdom!
I just wanted to hang out
I see! Well, you’ve got the right person, new kid!\nThat’s my specialty!\c\nI’ll bring the ocean surrounding this school to a\nnice boil with my hot-blooded battling![VAR 0114(0024)]
Oho! Looks like my battle studies wisdom is in\ndemand here!\c\nGuess I shouldn’t be surprised, since this school\nprioritizes battling so much![VAR 0114(0024)]
What’re you on about?! I came here for some\ngood battling, not teatime and chats by the\r\nwater cooler![VAR 0114(0024)]
In any case, I’ll do my best! Leave it to the\nhot-blooded Dendra![VAR 0114(0024)]
Don’t worry, you’re in good hands! Like, a\nHariyama’s hands! Y’know how tough those are![VAR 0114(0024)]
Hey, new kid! Man, that Terarium sure is\nsomething![VAR 0114(0024)]
It’s kinda like the Blueberry version of our own\nacademy’s schoolyard, huh?[VAR 0114(0024)]
All that open space is so liberating! It’s perfect\nfor long-distance running![VAR 0114(0024)]
For my next class, I’m thinking of having\neveryone run a lap around the Terarium...\r\nWhat do you think?[VAR 0114(0024)]
Good idea!
I dunno...
That’s right! It’s a great way to warm up before a\nleg day workout. What could possibly go wrong?[VAR 0114(0024)]
You’re right, it might be a bit much... Guess I’m\njust itching to go for a run!\c\nOh well... OK, fine, just half a lap, then![VAR 0114(0024)]
So...I’ll see you there, right? Of course I will![VAR 0114(0024)]
Man, the students here sure are fired up![VAR 0114(0024)]
Especially the kiddos taking battle studies.\nThey’re always in the zone![VAR 0114(0024)]
Y’know, I heard that you get more credits here\nfor battle-related courses! Maybe that’s why\r\nthey’re so on top of their game?[VAR 0114(0024)]
I mean, it makes sense! If you’re really good at\nbattling, you’ve got a future as a ranger, as a pro\r\nTrainer, or working in the League![VAR 0114(0024)]
So many possibilities!
Wait, for real?!
And of course, you could even become a battle\nstudies instructor like yours truly![VAR 0114(0024)]
Oho! You didn’t know?!\c\nSo you became a Champion just because you\ncould?! That’s true dedication to Pokémon![VAR 0114(0024)]
Well, battle studies or not, putting your best\neffort into studying is important! A whole world\r\nof opportunities opens up for you if you do![VAR 0114(0024)]
Make the most of your time in school while you\ncan, new kid![VAR 0114(0024)]
Ah, didn’t mean to get all preachy on you![VAR 0114(0024)]
Y’know, I’m kinda curious about you, new kid—\nas your teacher and fellow competitor![VAR 0114(0024)]
I know! What do you say to trading Pokémon\nso we can get to know each other better?[VAR 0114(0024)]
All right! Let’s get started! I’ve got a Meditite!\nWhat about you, new kid?[VAR 0114(0024)]
[VAR BD06(0000)][VAR 1303(0001,0000)][VAR 0101(0001)]! Nice choice—I can really\nfeel\r\nits\r\nosu-ness!\c\nI’ll train it every day and get it nice and strong![VAR 0114(0024)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]So you’ll trade your [VAR 0101(0001)] for\nmy\r\nMeditite?[VAR 0114(0024)]
You can’t trade Ms. Dendra a Pokémon if you\naren’t its original Trainer!
You can’t trade Ms. Dendra such a rare Pokémon!
You can’t trade Ms. Dendra a Shiny Pokémon!
Wait, we can’t trade if you’ve only got one\nPokémon in your party!\c\nMake sure you’ve got at least two Pokémon\nin your party and come see me again! Osu![VAR 0114(0024)]
Oh, maybe not right now, eh? Lemme know when\nyou’re up to trade! Osu![VAR 0114(0024)]
Osu, new kid!\c\nWhaddya say—feel like doing a trade with me\nnow?![VAR 0114(0024)]
Osu, new kid! Do I smell an invitation to battle?![VAR 0114(0024)]
Hoho! Guess my nose led me astray... Well, you\nknow I’m up for a battle anytime you feel like it![VAR 0114(0024)]
Well, that’s an invite I simply can’t turn down!\nC’mon—I’ll race you to the battle court![VAR 0114(0024)]
[~ 62]
Oh, that stings! And you really trounced me, too![VAR 0114(0024)]
But hey, at least I learned a lot! I’m gonna take\nthis experience and win next time![VAR 0114(0024)]
Thanks for everything, new kid! Here, take these\nas a token of my gratitude![VAR 0114(0024)]
Have your Pokémon chug some Protein so they\ncan smash through their limits! Osu![VAR 0114(0024)]
[~ 62]
Ahhh, another day, another great battle! Thanks,\nnew kid![VAR 0114(0024)]
I won’t let you win so easily next time! Smash\nthrough your limits![VAR 0114(0024)]
Thanks for letting me eke out a win! Really helps\nme save face as a battle studies instructor!\c\nWhy don’t you go look out on the ocean and\nsoak in your defeat?[VAR 0114(0024)]
Man, the clubroom sure is full of little rascals!\nAhhh, so much youthful energy![VAR 0114(0024)]
To tell you the truth, I don’t do good with planes.\c\nI really gotta steel myself when I come to\nBlueberry Academy![VAR 0114(0024)]
You know you can still train in the middle of\nbattles, right?!\c\nNext time we battle, pay attention to how I’m\nmoving—it’s how I train my heart and lungs![VAR 0114(0024)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Your [VAR 0101(0001)] sure is\nenergized\r\ntoday,\r\nnew kid!\c\nIt’s gobbling up all the sandwiches I make for\nit, too![VAR 0114(0024)]
How’s the Meditite I traded you doing?! That li’l\nfella loves his punches!\c\nDoesn’t matter what he’s facing—he’ll unleash a\nhuge flurry of punches and smash ’em to bits![VAR 0114(0024)]

Greetings. I am Hassel, the art teacher at Naranja\nAcademy—as well as a member of the Elite Four.[VAR 0114(0012)]
Greetings. I am Hassel, the art teacher at Uva\nAcademy—as well as a member of the Elite Four.[VAR 0114(0012)]
It is such a pleasure to be able to meet all the\nfine students at Blueberry Academy.[VAR 0114(0012)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Ah, young [VAR 0100(0000)]. So you are\nthe\r\none\r\nwho\r\ninvited\r\nme here.[VAR 0114(0012)]
To think that in the brief time since I last saw you,\nyou’d gain such an important role at this school...[VAR 0114(0012)]
It-it’s so surprising! And I’m so habby for you...\nI...I just...[VAR 0114(0012)]
Please don’t cry
Uh, Mr. Hassel?
...I’m very close to tears, but I’ll do my best to\nhold it in for now.[VAR 0114(0012)]
I don’t want to scare the other students here,\nafter all![VAR 0114(0012)]
I can’t express how pleased I am to have this\nopportunity to teach at another school.[VAR 0114(0012)]
Although I wonder... What does this academy\nneed of me? Am I here in my capacity as an art\r\ninstructor or as a member of the Elite Four?[VAR 0114(0012)]
An art instructor!
An Elite Four member!
I would hope so, but the students’ reaction to\nmy last art lecture seemed...lukewarm.\r\nPerhaps it was my imagination, though.[VAR 0114(0012)]
Ah, I should have known!\c\nThat would explain the lukewarm reaction I got\nwhen I held an art lecture...[VAR 0114(0012)]
You know, I have heard that Blueberry Academy\nplaces a strong emphasis on the study and\r\npractice of Pokémon battles.[VAR 0114(0012)]
I think that for my next lecture, I will invite\nProfessor Gible and do something a little bit\r\nmore hands-on. Thank you for your input![VAR 0114(0012)]
I’ve been told that the students here at Blueberry\nAcademy voluntarily take active roles in various\r\ncommittees—and even help run the school![VAR 0114(0012)]
I suppose it’s fitting that a new school like this\none would also be so boldly experimental.[VAR 0114(0012)]
I admit, though, that I personally have my doubts\nabout saddling students with such responsibility.\c\nIt seems a rather great burden to place on them\nwhen they are still so young...[VAR 0114(0012)]
How’s that?
Go on...?
Well, youth is the only period of life in which one\nmay indulge in play without a care in the world.[VAR 0114(0012)]
In that sense, I worry about you too, you know.[VAR 0114(0012)]
Please do take care not to overburden yourself\nwith the expectations of others.[VAR 0114(0012)]
Ah, but I do apologize... As I get older, I seem\nmore prone to offering unsolicited advice.[VAR 0114(0012)]
Now, how about we make things more cheerful—\nwith a Pokémon trade, perhaps?[VAR 0114(0012)]
Thank you kindly for humoring me. Now, I would\nlike to offer up a fine specimen of an Arctibax.\r\nHow about you, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0012)]
[VAR BD06(0000)][VAR 0101(0001)] is a fitting Pokémon indeed.\nI\r\nwould\r\nexpect\r\nno less from you.\c\nI will be sure to take very good care of it.[VAR 0114(0012)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]You’re willing to trade your [VAR 0101(0001)] for\nmy\r\nArctibax,\r\nthen?[VAR 0114(0012)]
You can’t trade Mr. Hassel a Pokémon if you\naren’t its original Trainer!
You can’t trade Mr. Hassel such a rare Pokémon!
You can’t trade Mr. Hassel a Shiny Pokémon!
Hmm... It’s not wise to trade when you only have\none Pokémon with you.\c\nSee to it that you have at least two Pokémon in\nyour party, and then we can trade![VAR 0114(0012)]
Please don’t hesitate to come speak to me again\nshould you be in the mood for a trade.[VAR 0114(0012)]
Would you like to trade Pokémon with me?[VAR 0114(0012)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Say, young [VAR 0100(0000)], would you\nbe\r\nwilling\r\nto\r\nhave\r\na\r\nbattle\r\nwith\r\nme?[VAR 0114(0012)]
Ah, perhaps another time, then.[VAR 0114(0012)]
I’m excited to learn just how strong you’ve\nbecome.[VAR 0114(0012)]
[~ 54]
When I faced you at the Pokémon League, your\nstrength was a work in progress—you still held\r\npotential that had yet to be fully realized.[VAR 0114(0012)]
But now...it has become so...so unshakable...[VAR 0114(0012)]
You’b...you’b come so far...I—I just can’t...\nBWUUUH huh huh hoi hoi![VAR 0114(0012)]
I hope you continue on your path with a sense of\nfreedom—and of humility.[VAR 0114(0012)]
You came up with the [VAR FF00(0008)]Moved to Tears emote [VAR FF00(0000)]by\nwatching Hassel!
Thank you for the battle!\c\nI think someone with such skill deserves a little\ntreasure from the dragon’s hoard.[VAR 0114(0012)]
I’m happy to battle you anytime, as long as you\nfeel you have something to learn from me.[VAR 0114(0012)]
Fortune smiled on me this time, but...\c\nJudging from how the match went, who knows if\nI will be so lucky next time.[VAR 0114(0012)]
It feels like you’ve grown more and more each\ntime I see you. It’s enough to bring a tear to this\r\nold man’s eye...[VAR 0114(0012)]
All the students here at Blueberry Academy are\nso nice. It truly is a pleasure to teach them.[VAR 0114(0012)]
You know, I saw Brassie on one of those big TV\nscreens in Levincia. Doesn’t it make you happy\r\nto see a friend giving it their all?[VAR 0114(0012)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]The [VAR 0101(0001)] you traded me is just the\nsweetest\r\nthing,\r\n[VAR 0100(0000)].\c\nIt always seems happy to serve as a model for my\npaintings![VAR 0114(0012)]
How is Arctibax doing, by the way? He loves\nbelly rubs, so don’t be afraid to give him a good\r\nscratching from time to time![VAR 0114(0012)]

Can you believe they’re having me teach my\nfirst class ever HERE instead of back home?![VAR 0114(0028)]
Just do your best!
You’ll do fine!
Easy for you to say. You’re not the one\nteaching the class...[VAR 0114(0028)]
You sound so sure! Wish I had even half of that\nkind of confidence...[VAR 0114(0028)]
Oh, what am I saying? You got me over here, so\nI’ll do my best to make the most of this![VAR 0114(0028)]
It’ll be the nurse’s office...Blueberry Academy\nstyle![VAR 0114(0028)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Hey, [VAR 0100(0000)]! You won’t\nbelieve\r\nthis...[VAR 0114(0028)]
I had my first class ever...and I managed to screw\nup already![VAR 0114(0028)]
Get this—the actual, like, class? Went perfectly.[VAR 0114(0028)]
But then I finished my lesson and realized...I was\nin the wrong classroom the whole time![VAR 0114(0028)]
Oof, that’s rough
Eh, it happens!
I think they were having study hall or something.\nThen I go marching on in and start teaching\r\nhealth lessons! They must’ve thought I was crazy![VAR 0114(0028)]
What do you mean “it happens”?\c\nI know you’re trying to cheer me up, but I’m\npretty sure that was a first—both for Blueberry\r\nAcademy AND [VAR 1107(00FF,0206)]NaranjUva Academy...[VAR 0114(0028)]
Ugh, no, let’s change the topic! Just thinking\nabout it makes me want to hide in a hole![VAR 0114(0028)]
I should just forget about the mess-up and\nkeep on marching along![VAR 0114(0028)]
Hey, [VAR 0100(0000)]! Guess what?[VAR 0114(0028)]
Remember how I went to the wrong classroom\nand lectured a bunch of random students?[VAR 0114(0028)]
Well, some of those kids came and found me\n’cause they wanted to ask questions![VAR 0114(0028)]
I thought that teaching the wrong class would\nforever be a stain on my teaching career...[VAR 0114(0028)]
but it looks like those students got something out\nof it in the end![VAR 0114(0028)]
I’m like...really, super happy about it![VAR 0114(0028)]
That’s great!
That’s wild!
I know, right?![VAR 0114(0028)]
Being a teacher really is fun after all... I mean,\nit’s not a total cakewalk either, but still![VAR 0114(0028)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]I’m glad I kept at it! Thank you,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0028)]
Oh, that’s right! Do you have a minute?[VAR 0114(0028)]
You’re always helping me out, so I wanted to\nreturn the favor.[VAR 0114(0028)]
Wanna trade with me? We can get to know each\nother better that way![VAR 0114(0028)]
OK! I’ve got a Mareanie. What about you?[VAR 0114(0028)]
[VAR BD06(0000)][VAR 1303(0001,0000)][VAR 0101(0001)], huh? I thought you’d pick\nsomething\r\nlike\r\nthat!\c\nI’ll take good care of it so it can grow big,\nstrong, and healthy![VAR 0114(0028)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]So you wanna trade your [VAR 0101(0001)] for\nmy\r\nMareanie,\r\nright?[VAR 0114(0028)]
You can’t trade Nurse Miriam a Pokémon if you\naren’t its original Trainer!
You can’t trade Nurse Miriam such a rare\nPokémon!
You can’t trade Nurse Miriam a Shiny Pokémon!
Hold on, we can’t trade if you’ve only got one\nPokémon in your party! Bring at least two and\r\ncome find me again! Thaaanks![VAR 0114(0028)]
Huh, for real? You should think twice about\nturning me down![VAR 0114(0028)]
Have you come around to trading Pokémon and\ngetting to know each other better?[VAR 0114(0028)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]What’s up, [VAR 0100(0000)]?\nDo\r\nyou\r\nwant\r\nto\r\nbattle\r\nme\r\nor\r\nsomething?[VAR 0114(0028)]
Oh, changed your mind? Well, that’s fine,\nI guess.[VAR 0114(0028)]
For sure—I’m not busy doing anything anyways!\nI’ll go to the court with you.[VAR 0114(0028)]
[~ 61]
You kids are always going all-out. I can’t\nkeep up...[VAR 0114(0028)]
Especially you—you’re way too strong! You gotta\nlearn how to hold back a little bit once in a while![VAR 0114(0028)]
Well, since you beat me, I’ll teach you this\ncool pose![VAR 0114(0028)]
I think that pose is on its way out, but it’s not\nquite in cringe territory yet.\c\nUse your best judgment on when to whip it out![VAR 0114(0028)]
You learned the [VAR FF00(0008)]Aye-Aye, Cap’n emote[VAR FF00(0000)] from\nNurse Miriam!
OK, here’s a little first aid... Plus an extra\nsomething from me, too.[VAR 0114(0028)]
Don’t overdo it and go hurting yourself, OK?[VAR 0114(0028)]
Wait, did you finally learn how to hold back a\nlittle? Maybe you’re finally growing up![VAR 0114(0028)]
Have you ever used one of those healing\nmachines in the Terarium?\c\nI hear you can operate them yourself and heal up\nyour party, right? Reminds me of my Pokémon\r\nCenter days![VAR 0114(0028)]
Is there...not a nurse’s office in this school?\c\nWhere does everyone go if they wanna play sick?[VAR 0114(0028)]
Man, all this prep for my classes is tough... The\nteachers here make it look so easy![VAR 0114(0028)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]The [VAR 0101(0001)] you gave me is doing\nso well!\r\nA little\r\ntoo well, if I’m being honest!\c\nReminds me of a certain someone![VAR 0114(0028)]
The Mareanie I traded you sure is great, huh?\nShe’s got a pretty rare Ability and stuff!\c\nTrain her up good and give her some time on the\nbattle court, OK?[VAR 0114(0028)]

That is of no consequence![VAR 0114(0017)]

I am so very glad that you are here! Praise\nMother Nature![VAR 0114(0017)]
I had planned to meet with the Top Champion\ntoday, but I have just now canceled that plan!\r\nShall we instead talk of art together?[VAR 0114(0017)]
What? You came in the Top Champion’s stead?\nWell, I cannot be bothered by that.[VAR 0114(0017)]
I don’t care what the reason is—if we can make\na masterpiece together once more, then fine![VAR 0114(0017)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Well then, [VAR 0100(0000)], are you\nready\r\nto\r\nopen\r\nwide\r\na\r\ndoor\r\nto the world of art?[VAR 0114(0017)]

Avant-garde! Very well, then. Let us head to\nmy studio.[VAR 0114(0017)]

My leaping down from that windmill to appear\nbefore those who would challenge my Gym\r\nlends an added depth to our battles![VAR 0114(0017)]
I see!
Oh...yeah?
I knew you would understand my reasoning,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]! Hahahaha![VAR 0114(0017)]
Though I believe I can spare my legs today, as we\nare sure to create my greatest masterpiece yet—\r\neven if I do not alight from above![VAR 0114(0017)]
But I digress. We are both artists, are we not?\nWe have no further use for words now.[VAR 0114(0017)]
I assume you are ready? Let our collaborative\nwork of art begin![VAR 0114(0017)]
Seeing you in the midst of battle—you are like a\nunique gradient, subtly changing hues![VAR 0114(0017)]
Riotous and yet gentle! Such contrast... I lack the\nwords to express it. My hat goes off to you![VAR 0114(0017)]
My battles with you are truly a gift. Each time, I\nam made to remember how I felt so long ago\r\nwhen I first ventured into this world of art.[VAR 0114(0017)]
Ah, I almost forgot. You were here for the Gym\ninspection in the Top Champion’s stead, correct?[VAR 0114(0017)]
Well, that is of no consequence. Report on my\nGym here as you see fit.[VAR 0114(0017)]
Ah! My inspiration is overflowing, as if drawn\nfrom a bottomless well![VAR 0114(0017)]

Yo, Champ.[VAR 0114(004A)]
Gotta thank you again for conquering the\nBB League.[VAR 0114(004A)]
All the tension here melted right away once we\ngot our new Champion![VAR 0114(004A)]
If I had my Drayster druthers, Kieran and I’d be\nhaving fun battling again...[VAR 0114(004A)]
I thought we’d have patched things up by now,\nbut I guess things ain’t that simple.[VAR 0114(004A)]
It’ll work out!
Just give it time!
You know just what to say, huh? Good quality in\na reigning Champion![VAR 0114(004A)]
Guess I ended up kinda using you to try and get\nwhat I wanted, huh, bud?[VAR 0114(004A)]
Sorry about that. I didn’t mean to. I dropped the\nslacker life for once, and I just got carried away.[VAR 0114(004A)]
Anyway, hope you’ll accept my apology.\nNo attitude, just gratitude.[VAR 0114(004A)]
Yo, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(004A)]
How goes the busy life of the League Club\npresident? Nose to the grindstone?[VAR 0114(004A)]
“President”?!
Wait—me?!
Hang on, you didn’t know? Yeah, the BB League\nChamp doubles as president. So that’s officially\r\nyou now. Them’s the breaks![VAR 0114(004A)]
I didn’t know!
No one told me!
My bad! Yeah, that’s the deal![VAR 0114(004A)]
Don’t worry about it, though! We all got your\nback.[VAR 0114(004A)]
Even when I was on top of the game, I made it a\npoint to not call myself Champion.[VAR 0114(004A)]
That way the Elite Four of us could just trade off\nclub prez duties...and I wouldn’t have to do ’em\r\nall myself![VAR 0114(004A)]
Anyway, I’ll take responsibility if anything gets\nhairy, so don’t worry. Dive in and prez it up, prez![VAR 0114(004A)]
Yo yo, bud. Got an update regarding the “you\nbeing League Club president” thing. And I quote:[VAR 0114(004A)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]“Foisting all those responsibilities onto\n[VAR 0100(0000)]—that’s\r\njust\r\nnot right!”[VAR 0114(004A)]
Yeah, Lacey really raked me over the coals for\nthat—and for my general slack-offery.[VAR 0114(004A)]
And so...guess we’re now all stuck splitting\nLeague Club president duties again.[VAR 0114(004A)]
Give it your all!
Congrats, co-prez!

Whoof! Didn’t take you for the facetious\ntype, bud![VAR 0114(004A)]
I’m really not excited about having more work...[VAR 0114(004A)]
Feel free to come take some off my plate if you\never feel like helping. Seriously. Any time. Help.[VAR 0114(004A)]
Come to think of it, part of a club president’s job\nis supporting the other members, right?[VAR 0114(004A)]
Guess I can do that much![VAR 0114(004A)]
Supportive mode, activate! Let’s trade\nPokémon...supportively![VAR 0114(004A)]
That’s what I like to hear. I’m putting up\nDuraludon, obviously! What’ll you trade me?[VAR 0114(004A)]
[VAR BD06(0000)][VAR 0101(0001)]’s a great choice.\nThat’s\r\na\r\nChampion’s\r\nPokémon\r\nfor sure!\c\nDon’t worry. I may slack on a lot of stuff, but I’ll\ntake good care of your [VAR 0101(0001)].[VAR 0114(004A)]

You can’t trade Drayton a Pokémon if you\naren’t its original Trainer!
You can’t trade Drayton such a rare Pokémon!
You can’t trade Drayton a Shiny Pokémon!
Hang on, bud. You’ve only got one Pokémon with\nyou. You gotta bring more, or we can’t trade.[VAR 0114(004A)]
Aw, c’mon...don’t be like that! We gotta work\ntogether here![VAR 0114(004A)]
Oooh, you feeling that team spirit now? Let’s\ntrade it up, then![VAR 0114(004A)]
Hey, bud. You up for a battle?[VAR 0114(004A)]
Fair enough! You can’t go giving 100 percent all\nthe time. Gotta know when to hit the brakes.[VAR 0114(004A)]
Nice. Let’s stroll on over to the battle court, then.[VAR 0114(004A)]
Uh, hang on, bud! We’re going for a Double\nBattle. Better bring at least one more Pokémon![VAR 0114(004A)]
Man, facing off against you is ridiculous.\nSo much fun![VAR 0114(004A)]
I’ve got something for you, bud. A little token of\nmy everlasting gratitude.[VAR 0114(004A)]
Here—don’t mind the dust! I really oughta clean\nmy closet.[VAR 0114(004A)]
Now we can be twinsies! Heh heh.[VAR 0114(004A)]
You received a [VAR FF00(0008)]Tracksuit (Black / Gold) [VAR FF00(0000)]from\nDrayton!
There you go again getting even better. Guess I\nshould’ve expected that, huh, bud?[VAR 0114(004A)]
Y’know, I think I’ve come to rely on our battles\nas a way to de-stress![VAR 0114(004A)]
Heh heh! Don’t mind me, just scooping up a W\nover here.\c\nI get if you’re upset, but don’t go full Kieran on\nme, OK?[VAR 0114(004A)]
You probably think this is a skirt I’ve got on, huh?\c\nHeh heh! Not quite! I just tied my cape around\nmy waist.[VAR 0114(004A)]
I’m really not made for learning in classrooms.\nI’ve gotten held back...three times, I think?\c\nBut I get to savor the sweet school life longer\nthan everyone else. It’s a pretty good deal.[VAR 0114(004A)]
Man, I love chairs. Don’t you love chairs?\nWhat lifesavers.\c\nI don’t get why everyone doesn’t just sit all the\ntime. Standing up’s tiring work![VAR 0114(004A)]

[VAR BD06(0000)]Hello, [VAR 0100(0000)]. I believe this\nmarks\r\nour\r\nfirst\r\ninteraction\r\nin\r\nthis\r\nclubroom.[VAR 0114(0048)]
... ... ...\n... ... ...[VAR 0114(0048)]
I hope your Agias hasn’t suffered any...\naftereffects from the other day?[VAR 0114(0048)]
Nah, it’s doing great!
We’ve been flying a lot!
That is a relief.[VAR 0114(0048)]
Seeing it consume such a quantity of that\nsupplement caused me some concern.[VAR 0114(0048)]
Perhaps Agias’s sturdy constitution has shielded it\nfrom any ill effects.[VAR 0114(0048)]
I suspect it would be dangerous to let any other\nPokémon eat as much of the supplement.[VAR 0114(0048)]
Since I usually ride my Skarmory for the Flying\nTime Trial, I have not had the opportunity to test\r\nsuch matters myself.[VAR 0114(0048)]
I have nothing else to report. Let us conclude this\nconversation.[VAR 0114(0048)]
I have a question, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0048)]
How was it that you and Kieran first met?[VAR 0114(0048)]
On a school trip!
We paired up!
So it was a trip that started it all?\c\nI do recall that Kieran and Carmine returned to\nKitakami shortly before Kieran’s...change.[VAR 0114(0048)]
P-paired?!\c\n...Ahem. Pardon me.\c\nI understand now that you mean you undertook\nyour school trip activities as a pair.[VAR 0114(0048)]
I have been wondering why your presence\nprovoked such intense reactions from Kieran.[VAR 0114(0048)]
Based on what you’ve said, I doubt that the\ncircumstances of your meeting were the cause.[VAR 0114(0048)]
My question is answered. Thank you.[VAR 0114(0048)]
[VAR BD06(0000)][VAR 0100(0000)], I would like to\nconsult\r\nyou\r\non\r\nsomething.[VAR 0114(0048)]
Lately, I feel that...something is the matter with\nme.[VAR 0114(0048)]
I sometimes feel an ache within my chest, and my\nappetite is dampened.[VAR 0114(0048)]
But when I go to the nurse’s office, I am told that\nnothing is amiss.[VAR 0114(0048)]
Is it possible that my symptoms are the result\nof some sort of physiological change?[VAR 0114(0048)]
Any ideas what it could be?
When do your symptoms occur?
I have no idea whatsoever.[VAR 0114(0048)]
They occur with no regularity whatsoever.[VAR 0114(0048)]
I suppose the sole common factor is that...these\nsymptoms arise when I think of Kieran.[VAR 0114(0048)]
But surely no causal relationship can be found\nthere.[VAR 0114(0048)]
*sigh*[VAR 0114(0048)]
I note that my symptoms have abated during\nour conversation, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0048)]
It may be that speaking with you has a\ntherapeutic effect.[VAR 0114(0048)]
In order to test this hypothesis, I propose that we\ntrade Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0048)]
Your consent is appreciated. I choose to offer\na Skarmory. I await your choice.[VAR 0114(0048)]
[VAR BD06(0000)][VAR 0101(0001)] is...wonderful. Thank you,\n[VAR 0100(0000)].\c\nI will raise this Pokémon with great care.[VAR 0114(0048)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]You will trade your [VAR 0101(0001)] for\nmy\r\nSkarmory?[VAR 0114(0048)]
You can’t trade Amarys a Pokémon if you aren’t\nits original Trainer!
You can’t trade Amarys such a rare Pokémon!
You can’t trade Amarys a Shiny Pokémon!
Ah, wait. Trading cannot proceed as long as you\nhave only one Pokémon on hand.\c\nPlease put two or more Pokémon in your party so\nthat we may advance proceedings.[VAR 0114(0048)]
...Refusal acknowledged.[VAR 0114(0048)]
My proposal to trade Pokémon still stands.[VAR 0114(0048)]
I propose a battle. Do you accept?[VAR 0114(0048)]
...Refusal acknowledged.[VAR 0114(0048)]
Then let us relocate to the court. Come with me.[VAR 0114(0048)]
At this institution, Double Battles are standard.\nI suggest that you bring at least two Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0048)]
Congratulations on your victory.[VAR 0114(0048)]
Battling you always brings me a certain sense\nof tranquility.[VAR 0114(0048)]
Allow me to express my gratitude by passing on\nthe most powerful technique I know.[VAR 0114(0048)]
Carmine taught this to me...\c\nShe said that if you assume this pose, victory\nover your opponent is instantly assured.[VAR 0114(0048)]
You learned the [VAR FF00(0008)]Finger Heart emote[VAR FF00(0000)] from\nAmarys!
Congratulations on your victory.[VAR 0114(0048)]
Time for me to go. So long, then.[VAR 0114(0048)]
Victory belongs to me. Well fought.[VAR 0114(0048)]
Time is finite. Every second of every minute must\nbe used with great care.[VAR 0114(0048)]
Yes, [VAR 0100(0000)]? What is it?\c\nHas my fine taste in eyeglasses caught your\nattention?[VAR 0114(0048)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]With you around, [VAR 0100(0000)], I\ncan\r\nrest\r\nassured\r\nthat\r\nKieran\r\nis\r\nin\r\ngood hands.[VAR 0114(0048)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]The [VAR 0101(0001)] you traded me is\nwonderful.\r\nTruly wonderful.[VAR 0114(0048)]
I should mention that the Skarmory I traded you\nis inside a Heavy Ball.\c\nThis ball is well suited to Steel-type Pokémon in\nboth function and design. It truly is beautiful.[VAR 0114(0048)]

Hello, hello![VAR 0114(002A)]
It’s everybody’s favorite biology teacher!\nMr. Jacq here, visiting from [VAR 1107(00FF,0206)]NaranjUva Academy![VAR 0114(002A)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Wow, [VAR 0100(0000)]. We do seem to\nkeep\r\nrunning\r\ninto\r\neach\r\nother\r\nlately,\r\ndon’t we?[VAR 0114(002A)]
You’re here as an exchange student, right?[VAR 0114(002A)]
I’m your homeroom teacher back home, so it\nonly seems fair I come check in on you.[VAR 0114(002A)]
Tell me—is there anything you’ve been pouring\nyourself into here at Blueberry Academy?[VAR 0114(002A)]
Pokémon battling!
Filling my Pokédex!
Making new friends!
No wonder you’re a Champion Rank Trainer!\c\nI’d bet you can really go all out against your\nopponents at a top-ranked school like this one.\r\nYou are one lucky kid![VAR 0114(002A)]
Wow, really? That makes your old biology\nteacher awfully happy to hear.\c\nSo even in this new land, you’re doing your best\nto toss those Poké Balls and never give up.\r\nHow about that![VAR 0114(002A)]
Wow! Have you already made a ton of new\nfriends here?\c\nI hope you’ll introduce me to them when you\nhave the chance.[VAR 0114(002A)]
Honestly, I was fairly worried about how you\nmight be doing. Unlike that school trip you\r\njoined, this time you came all on your own.[VAR 0114(002A)]
But it looks like you’re having a Wailmer of a\ntime here, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(002A)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Oh, I was meaning to ask you something,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]...\c\nWhat kind of Pokédex app are you using out\nthere in the Terarium?[VAR 0114(002A)]
There’s a Blueberry Pokédex!
Want me to just show you?
Wow! No way! Someone went and modded my\nPokédex app?![VAR 0114(002A)]
Of course, I did make the app open-source so\nanyone could add to it if they saw fit...[VAR 0114(002A)]
But who made this Blueberry Pokédex update?\nThe notes here say...a Mr. Cyrano?[VAR 0114(002A)]
Hmm, now that’s curious. The way this Cyrano\nwrites his code is very similar to Director Clavell.[VAR 0114(002A)]
And I feel like I’ve heard the name Cyrano...\nsomewhere. Hmmm. But where?[VAR 0114(002A)]
Well...no matter who he is, he did a nice job with\nthis update. Thanks for filling me in about it![VAR 0114(002A)]
Hello, hello, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(002A)]
Guess what! I went ahead and downloaded that\nBlueberry Pokédex update for myself too.[VAR 0114(002A)]
That’s great!
Now we match!
It really is! I like the design the developer went\nwith. So blue and cool.[VAR 0114(002A)]
Hehe... I do like to keep up with my students,\nyou know.[VAR 0114(002A)]
Now I’m on fire with the desire to complete this\nnew Pokédex! I’m so excited that I’ve been\r\nrunning all around that Terarium they have here.[VAR 0114(002A)]
And one really must take note of the stunning\nconstruction of that dome!\c\nWhoever thought up its design must be some\nkind of genius![VAR 0114(002A)]
So many varieties of Pokémon can live there—in\nenvirons that suit them perfectly![VAR 0114(002A)]
It’s the kind of thing you couldn’t pull off without\na great understanding of Pokémon habitats.[VAR 0114(002A)]
I’ll need to spend a bunch of time in the Terarium\nbefore I can complete the Blueberry Pokédex.[VAR 0114(002A)]
Though trading Pokémon is another great way\nto work on completing any Pokédex, of course![VAR 0114(002A)]
Since we’re here together, why don’t you and I\ntake the opportunity to trade?[VAR 0114(002A)]
Oh, I sure would be happy to get a Pokémon\nfrom you. I think I’ll offer up my Gulpin here.\r\nWhat about you, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(002A)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Now [VAR 0101(0001)] is certainly an\nentertaining\r\nand\r\nattractive\r\nchoice!\c\nThanks so much for trading Pokémon with me![VAR 0114(002A)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Just to be sure, you’re happy to trade your\n[VAR 0101(0001)]\r\nfor\r\nmy Gulpin?[VAR 0114(002A)]
You can’t trade Mr. Jacq a Pokémon if you aren’t\nits original Trainer!
You can’t trade Mr. Jacq such a rare Pokémon!
You can’t trade Mr. Jacq a Shiny Pokémon!
Wait, I couldn’t let you trade away your only\nPokémon!\c\nMake sure you have at least two Pokémon in your\nparty. Then let’s talk.[VAR 0114(002A)]
I certainly don’t mind if you want to give your\nchoice a nice, long think.[VAR 0114(002A)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]So, [VAR 0100(0000)]! Did you decide\nyou’re\r\nready\r\nto\r\ntrade\r\nPokémon?[VAR 0114(002A)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]I recognize that look on your face,\n[VAR 0100(0000)].\r\nYou’re\r\nhankering\r\nfor\r\na\r\nbattle,\r\naren’t you?[VAR 0114(002A)]
Huh? You aren’t? Oops, sorry! I guess I got that\nall wrong.[VAR 0114(002A)]
Well, I’d be delighted to be your opponent!\c\nIt’s nice to have the chance to show off my skills\nnow and again. Here’s hoping I do OK![VAR 0114(002A)]
[~ 62]
Hehe. You beat me! I really can’t stand up to you\nin battle, can I, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(002A)]
But I super enjoy the chance to see how you keep\ngrowing and developing.[VAR 0114(002A)]
I’ll be here cheering for you, foreeever and ever![VAR 0114(002A)]
Those are just a little something I thought you\nmight like. Now we can be glasses twins![VAR 0114(002A)]
You received a pair of [VAR FF00(0008)]Hexagonal Glasses[VAR FF00(0000)]\n[VAR FF00(0008)](Mottled)[VAR FF00(0000)] from Mr. Jacq!
Hehe, you beat me again! You really are a\nstrong Trainer![VAR 0114(002A)]
If you don’t mind having me as your opponent,\nI’m happy to have a rematch whenever you like.[VAR 0114(002A)]
Looks like I managed to really pull out all the\nstops this time!\c\nI’m glad I could show you that your teacher\nhas some life in him yet![VAR 0114(002A)]
Isn’t the Terarium faaascinating?! What a place!\c\nIt’s like you can hardly throw a Poké Ball without\nhitting a Pokémon you can’t find at all in Paldea![VAR 0114(002A)]
It’s so fun to get to pop around to all these\ndifferent regions lately.\c\nI zone out the whole time we’re flying, and then\nI’m just there before I know it! Nice and easy![VAR 0114(002A)]
Oops. I forgot to change out of my sandals for\nthis visit...\c\nI’ll get yelled at for sure if Director Clavell sees\nme walking around someone else’s school like\r\nI’m on vacation at the beach...[VAR 0114(002A)]
[VAR BD06(0000)][VAR 0100(0000)],\nthat\r\n[VAR 0101(0001)]\r\nof\r\nyours\r\nis\r\nsuch\r\na\r\nunique\r\ncharacter!\c\nI can’t wait to see how it will continue to grow![VAR 0114(002A)]

This school... It’s filled with the smell of the new,\nthe modern.[VAR 0114(0027)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]So, are you the one who called me here,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0027)]
You’ve got some nerve, inviting me to such a\nmodern structure.[VAR 0114(0027)]
I have absolutely no interest in this place, but I\ndidn’t want you to lose face—so here I am.[VAR 0114(0027)]
Think of it as a favor from me. Heh heh...[VAR 0114(0027)]
I’ll expect you to return the favor at some point.\nPerhaps by doing as I say when needed.[VAR 0114(0027)]
Oh no...
You got it!
Heh! You reap what you sow. I suggest you look\nforward to the harvest![VAR 0114(0027)]
Hm? You’re more enthusiastic than I expected.\nWhich suits me just fine. Heh heh...[VAR 0114(0027)]
Oh, the things we can accomplish together, my\ndear puppet...[VAR 0114(0027)]
Ah, you again. I suppose whatever you’ve done\nsince we last spoke has become a part of history.[VAR 0114(0027)]
Initially I took the long journey here unwillingly,\nbut...when I think about it, we’re in Unova!\c\nThis place is a veritable treasure trove of history![VAR 0114(0027)]
I am practically overflowing with curiosity,\nespecially regarding those ancient ruins resting at\r\nthe bottom of the sea![VAR 0114(0027)]
...And Director Clavell isn’t here to snoop around\nin my business—another perk of this trip.[VAR 0114(0027)]
Ohohooo! I can’t wait to have a swim with my\nPokémon and go exploring![VAR 0114(0027)]
Sounds like fun!
Be safe out there
Heh heh! Of course it will be fun!\c\nThere is no greater treasure than experiencing\nancient wisdom![VAR 0114(0027)]
Heh heh, don’t worry yourself about me.\c\nShould I meet my end surrounded by ruins and\nartifacts...it would be a good way to go.[VAR 0114(0027)]
Ah...[VAR 0100(0000)]... It’s you...[VAR 0114(0027)]
What’s up?
Something wrong?
Isn’t it obvious? I’m exhausted by the sheer\nbliss of satisfaction and fulfillment.[VAR 0114(0027)]
Heh... No, the exact opposite. So many things\nare right that I am exhausted from satisfaction.[VAR 0114(0027)]
I took my Lumineon for a swim and visited the\nfamous Abyssal Ruins here in Unova...[VAR 0114(0027)]
They were...marvelous. Truly amazing.[VAR 0114(0027)]
Ancient contrivances to thwart intruders! The\nmysterious text etched onto the walls![VAR 0114(0027)]
Testing my wits against those of the ancients was\na truly rewarding experience.[VAR 0114(0027)]
But it would be a shame to dash straight to the\ndepths of the ruins too quickly. I plan on taking\r\nmy time with the exploration.[VAR 0114(0027)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]You know, [VAR 0100(0000)]... I\njust\r\nhad\r\nan\r\namusing idea.[VAR 0114(0027)]
You are a Champion, aren’t you? What say you\nand I trade Pokémon?[VAR 0114(0027)]
Any Pokémon belonging to a Champion is sure\nto be incredibly useful. So...would you be willing\r\nto trade for my Gimmighoul?[VAR 0114(0027)]
Excellent. Then you should pick which Pokémon\nyou want to trade. A species good at exploring\r\nwould be appreciated.[VAR 0114(0027)]
Ah yes. A worthwhile trade.\c\nDon’t you worry. I’ll take very good care of your\n[VAR 0101(0001)].[VAR 0114(0027)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Are you ready to trade your [VAR 0101(0001)] for\nmy\r\nGimmighoul?[VAR 0114(0027)]
You can’t trade Ms. Raifort a Pokémon if you\naren’t its original Trainer!
You can’t trade Ms. Raifort such a rare Pokémon!
You can’t trade Ms. Raifort a Shiny Pokémon!
...Ah, but I see you only have one Pokémon along\nwith you at the moment.\c\nYou would be wise to put at least two Pokémon\nin your party before agreeing to a trade.[VAR 0114(0027)]
History is full of deals refused and then later\naccepted. I trust you’ll have a change of heart.[VAR 0114(0027)]
So, how about you trade me one of your\nPokémon for my Gimmighoul?[VAR 0114(0027)]
I’ve been stuck indoors here for far too long.\nThis...smell of newness is driving me mad.\c\nWhat do you say we head outdoors for a battle?[VAR 0114(0027)]
Hm. I’d assumed you’d be more eager about this\nsort of thing. Perhaps I shall head out alone.[VAR 0114(0027)]
Heh heh... How very kind of you. Let’s make our\nway to the battlefield, then.[VAR 0114(0027)]
[~ 59]
You certainly are a worthy opponent. I see the\npath you’ve walked is one of glory and power.[VAR 0114(0027)]
Such strength... It would open all manner of ruins\nand ancient tombs to me! If I could only secure\r\nyour cooperation...[VAR 0114(0027)]
Ah, of course... Here, I’ve got a gift for you. You\nknow, out of the kindness of my heart.[VAR 0114(0027)]
It’s very valuable, you know. Don’t forget to\nthank me each night as you gaze upon it.[VAR 0114(0027)]
[~ 59]
Heh heh... Yes, yes, your strength will definitely\nbe most useful to me.\c\nHere, another bribe—I mean, gift for you.[VAR 0114(0027)]
I certainly hope you treasure these little moments\nspent with your dear teacher Raifort.[VAR 0114(0027)]
Those with great strength often grow arrogant,\nwhich in turn leads to their downfall.\c\nWere you trying to experience such a historical\ntwist of fate yourself?[VAR 0114(0027)]
Are you keeping those treasures of ruin under\ncontrol?\c\nIf you ever feel the need to pass them on to\nsomeone else, I’m always available.[VAR 0114(0027)]
Is it true that you entered the Great Crater of\nPaldea?\c\nIf so, I may borrow some of your time to discuss\nyour findings. Just a few days in my custody.[VAR 0114(0027)]
I admit the Terarium is an impressive work of\ntechnology, but...\c\nIt’s all twisted nature with no weight of history\nbehind it. I find no joy in that, personally.[VAR 0114(0027)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Your [VAR 0101(0001)] is proving to be very\nuseful,\r\njust\r\nas\r\nI\r\nhad\r\nexpected.\c\nIt has been a great help to my research and\nexploration of ruins.[VAR 0114(0027)]
I enjoy collecting antiques and ancient artifacts.\c\nThe Gimmighoul I gave you was becoming a bit\nof a problem, actually—it was always begging for\r\nold coins from my collection.[VAR 0114(0027)]

Our little Champion is comin’ into h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]iser own...[VAR 0114(001B)]
Come on, baby! Rattle me down to the bone![VAR 0114(001B)]
Hahaha! Wasn’t expectin’ you to rattle me\nTHAT much![VAR 0114(001B)]
You caught me off guard just like Shadow Sneak![VAR 0114(001B)]
Sorry for callin’ you a rookie. Hope we’re good.[VAR 0114(001B)]
I just wanted to prove the strength of Ghost\ntypes to Geeta, but I guess I got carried away.[VAR 0114(001B)]
You’re the real deal, my friend. I can guarantee\nthat.[VAR 0114(001B)]
From here on out, Ryme’s got your back.[VAR 0114(001B)]
If you run into any vexin’ Trainers or hexin’\nspecters, you just give me a call.[VAR 0114(001B)]
Now you go enjoy this big, wide world to the\nfullest, you hear me? Later, baby![VAR 0114(001B)]

Huh? I recognize you...[VAR 0114(001A)]
You here to hit the slopes? I don’t recall the snow\nbeing too good today...[VAR 0114(001A)]
I’m here for a battle
I came to say hi
Aw, for real...? I’ve got something important to\nbe dealing with in a bit, y’know...[VAR 0114(001A)]
What...? OK, now I really don’t understand what\nyou’re up to.[VAR 0114(001A)]
Oh, I see... You’re here to cover for Geeta.[VAR 0114(001A)]
So, your dream came true. You’re Champion\nRank now. You must be so happy.[VAR 0114(001A)]
Oh, my bad... That sounded a lot more sarcastic\nthan I’d intended.[VAR 0114(001A)]
Don’t get me wrong. I really think it’s amazing.\nJust... It’s complicated for me—that’s all.[VAR 0114(001A)]
Anyway, you came to test my skills, right?\nLet’s just get this over with.[VAR 0114(001A)]

Let’s head outside. You’d best hope it’s not\nsnowing.[VAR 0114(001A)]

The weather’s in your favor today. I guess the\nsnowy mountains decided to be kind.[VAR 0114(001A)]
Well, tough luck for you. The snowy mountains\nare on my side today.[VAR 0114(001A)]
These League-mandated inspections happen\na few times a year.[VAR 0114(001A)]
If we don’t show we’re up for the job, we’ll lose\nour positions as Gym Leaders.[VAR 0114(001A)]
Geeta always says it’s just a formality, but...[VAR 0114(001A)]
I’ve already had to give up on being a pro\nsnowboarder. If she takes away the talents\r\nI still have to show, then what’ll be left?[VAR 0114(001A)]
Sorry, didn’t mean to bring the temperature\ndown. It’s simple enough, really.[VAR 0114(001A)]
All I need to do is make sure the power of my\nPokémon chills you to the bone![VAR 0114(001A)]
Man, Geeta must really have it out for me.\nSending someone there’s no way I could beat...[VAR 0114(001A)]
Still, no regrets on my part. I gave it everything\nI had.[VAR 0114(001A)]
I hit you full force, and I lost anyway. It made me\nfeel...frustrated.[VAR 0114(001A)]
It makes me want to become stronger as a Gym\nLeader. Put more of myself into it.[VAR 0114(001A)]
I’d thought my passion had frozen over, but...\nyou’ve rekindled it for me.\c\nThanks, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(001A)]

Hello there! My name is Katy, and I am the owner\nof Patisserie Soapberry.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Oh? The new Champion everybody is talking\nabout—is it actually you, sweetie?[VAR 0114(0016)]
It sure is!
That’s me! The new Champion!
Hurray! I guessed correctly! I suppose that makes\nsense, though. You sure were strong![VAR 0114(0016)]
You really looked like you were enjoying yourself\nwhen you tried my sweet treats, too.\c\nPeople like that always have great potential.[VAR 0114(0016)]
So you’re here on an errand for the Top\nChampion, are you?[VAR 0114(0016)]
I had completely forgotten that she was\nsupposed to be going around for inspections![VAR 0114(0016)]
Thankfully, I just happened to be here today to\ngive cakes to my staff. Phew. Lucky me![VAR 0114(0016)]
Very well, then. Is it time for me to get a taste of\nour new Champion’s strength?[VAR 0114(0016)]
Oh? Are you here to let me have a taste of our\nnew Champion’s strength?[VAR 0114(0016)]
Hehe. Oh, what fun! Let’s go somewhere more\nsuited for battling.[VAR 0114(0016)]

I remember your olive-rolling prowess very\nwell, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0016)]
You had such vigor—it was almost as if you had\nTerastallized into a Fighting type yourself![VAR 0114(0016)]
How many Gyms had you been to when you first\ncame here to mine? Was it your first?[VAR 0114(0016)]
The Cortondo Gym is close to the academy, so\nmany young Trainers just starting out like to come\r\nhere first.[VAR 0114(0016)]
With that in mind, La Primera asks me to go soft\non Trainers—like a nice sponge cake.[VAR 0114(0016)]
I feel sad for my sweet little bugs, though, since\nthat means they quite often lose their battles.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Hehe. But opportunities like this get me excited\nbecause I can finally show my true skill.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Allow me to knead you into submission![VAR 0114(0016)]
That was quite the battle. I must say that your\nskill rivals that of even La Primera.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Ah! How sweet it is to battle without holding\nback—even if I end up losing![VAR 0114(0016)]
I am beginning to think that going too soft on\npeople may be no good for either party.[VAR 0114(0016)]
My culinary teacher, Mr. Kofu, did tell me to put\nmore of myself into my baking, after all.[VAR 0114(0016)]
I think I may try conducting battles in more of my\nown style from now on![VAR 0114(0016)]
If Trainers complain that the Cortondo Gym is\nsuddenly more difficult, I’ll just tell them that\r\nnot all pastries are sweet![VAR 0114(0016)]
Good-bye for now. I hope to see you again\nsomeday![VAR 0114(0016)]

Hello, hello. Have you been out there catching\nlots of Pokémon?[VAR 0114(002A)]

It appears that you are doing plutôt bien—quite\nwell, that is—flourishing in the Unova region![VAR 0114(0026)]
Even if they speak the same language here as in\nPaldea, the culture is somehow different, isn’t it?\c\nPerhaps your dear Salvatore’s education about\nthe world has been of help to you here?[VAR 0114(0026)]
For sure!
I’m not sure...
Oh! Merci so very, very much! I am so happy to\nhear you agree at once![VAR 0114(0026)]
Oh! Quel choc! This is quite disappointing, after\nall the hard work I put into making my classes so\r\nvery memorable and effective![VAR 0114(0026)]
But my work is not done! The students of\nl’Académie Blueberrie would benefit from\r\nmemorable, effective lessons on language\r\nand life as well![VAR 0114(0026)]

I must once again say merci so very, very much\nto you for inviting me here, mon ami[VAR 1100(00FF,0100)]e.[VAR 0114(0026)]
Jetting around from one region to another—yes,\nit brings back so many memories of my past![VAR 0114(0026)]

Why, when I was a young man, I traveled across\nthe entire world! Dans le monde entier![VAR 0114(0026)]
I went here and there and everywhere as a young\nbackpacker, beholding all the world’s beauty.[VAR 0114(0026)]
And here now, a question to you![VAR 0114(0026)]
What do you think that I, a young Salvatore,\nfound le plus beau—the most beautiful of all—\r\namong the many sights that I saw?[VAR 0114(0026)]
The mountains!
The oceans!
The deserts!
The towns!
[VAR BD06(0000)]Non non! That is not it at all! Was this question\nmore difficult than I thought,\r\n[VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0026)]
The most beautiful sight of all...was the face of a\ncertain woman, caught in stunning profile![VAR 0114(0026)]
And that woman is now ma femme—my wife![VAR 0114(0026)]
It’s a very good story, isn’t it? You’re welcome\nfor the gift of getting to hear it.[VAR 0114(0026)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]My dear [VAR 0100(0000)]! Are you as well\nand\r\ngood\r\nas\r\nI\r\non\r\nthis\r\nfine day?[VAR 0114(0026)]
All of the students at this school have such a\nfantastique passion for learning![VAR 0114(0026)]
They are so eager to learn new words so they\nmay communicate with Trainers across the world![VAR 0114(0026)]
You see what a difference it makes to have une\nbonne motivation—a good motivation trumps all![VAR 0114(0026)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]This reminds me, [VAR 0100(0000)].\nI’ve\r\nbeen\r\nwondering:\r\nDo\r\nyou\r\nhave\r\na\r\nparticular\r\naspiration\r\nfor\r\nthe future?[VAR 0114(0026)]
I’ve got so many!
Not so far...
So many! Quelle chance! You’re most fortunate\nto have many dreams, and I cheer for them all![VAR 0114(0026)]
Oh, not yet? Going at your own pace is a fine\nthing too. Don’t force yourself to try to match\r\nothers. Oui, à ton rythme, c’est bien.[VAR 0114(0026)]
Indeed, I myself only stumbled into becoming a\nteacher after traveling the world and learning the\r\nlanguages of ten different lands along the way![VAR 0114(0026)]
Life is full of many surprises. As is your teacher![VAR 0114(0026)]
Everything in life comes down to l’essentiel—the\nbasics. And personal interactions are the most\r\nbasic of all, making the whole world spin round.\c\nYou must be flexible in your dealings with others.[VAR 0114(0026)]
I think it would be good for you, mon ami[VAR 1100(00FF,0100)]e, to\ninteract more with your dear teacher Salvatore![VAR 0114(0026)]
C’est-à-dire—that is to say—we should trade\nPokémon![VAR 0114(0026)]
Voilà, I offer you this delightful Meowth! How\nwill you then respond, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0026)]

You can’t trade Mr. Salvatore a Pokémon if you\naren’t its original Trainer!
You can’t trade Mr. Salvatore such a rare\nPokémon!
You can’t trade Mr. Salvatore a Shiny Pokémon!
Wait—attendez! I cannot possibly take your only\nPokémon away from you!\c\nPlease, you must come again when you have at\nleast two Pokémon available to you.[VAR 0114(0026)]
Oh non! I am so very attristé—saddened—that\nyou would say something so disappointing![VAR 0114(0026)]

Oh ho! It seems old Salvatore got to show you\nsa meilleure performance—his best performance!\c\nI have no doubt that next time you will show me\nyour best performance in return![VAR 0114(0026)]
Some of the students at our school started to\ncall me “Brovatore,” but this is new vocabulary\r\nfor me. Tell me, what is a Brova?[VAR 0114(0026)]
Whenever I’m away for a while, all the students\nde ma classe—in my class, of course—pitch in\r\nto take care of little Pawmi for me.[VAR 0114(0026)]
When you are in a new place, all around you is\na veritable sea of strangers!\c\nYet take them one by one, and before you know\nit, you will have 100 new friends![VAR 0114(0026)]

I’ll be facing you in my role as a Gym Leader,\nso I’m going to use my regular team.[VAR 0114(0015)]
They all belong to the Normal type.\c\n“Normal” as in plain...average...unremarkable...\nrun-of-the-mill...[VAR 0114(0015)]
I’m pretty fond of them, you know? They suit me\nperfectly—I’m about as ordinary as you can get.[VAR 0114(0015)]
People, Pokémon... There’s no need to\novercomplicate things.[VAR 0114(0015)]

At the end of the day, though, nothing beats the\nrelief of coming home, even after a fun vacation.[VAR 0114(0015)]

It’ll do me good to admire talent that soars as\nhigh as yours from time to time.[VAR 0114(0015)]
Well, if the boss says I should do so, I’ll do so.\nShe won’t catch me doing it for fun, though.[VAR 0114(0015)]
In any case, I’ve been strictly told to cut down on\nmy overtime hours, so...I’ll call it a day.[VAR 0114(0015)]

Hiya, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0013)]
Rika here, at your service! Glad to be workin’\nwith ya![VAR 0114(0013)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]I’m not gonna lie,\n[VAR 0100(0000)].\r\nDidn’t\r\nexpect\r\nI’d\r\nbe\r\ngetting\r\nthis\r\ninvite\r\nfrom you![VAR 0114(0013)]
Just couldn’t get enough of ol’ Rika, eh?[VAR 0114(0013)]
Exactly!
I guess...?
Nice! It’s good to be honest! I don’t mind the\nattention, either.[VAR 0114(0013)]
You guess?! C’mon, be a bit more enthusiastic\nfor me![VAR 0114(0013)]
Anyway, let’s get down to business—you want me\nto bring some liveliness to the academy, right?[VAR 0114(0013)]
Nobody’s better at livening up a place than ol’\nRika! You just leave this to me![VAR 0114(0013)]
Last time I was here, I was basically babysittin’\nthe boss.[VAR 0114(0013)]
She may seem all professional and perfectly put\ntogether, but she can be super absent-minded\r\nsometimes. Someone’s gotta look after her.[VAR 0114(0013)]
I wouldn’t have guessed!
You make a good team!
It’s true! Even that Indigo Disk thing—the boss\ncompletely spaced on giving it to Briar![VAR 0114(0013)]
You got that right! I mean, it figures—we’ve been\nworking together a long time.[VAR 0114(0013)]
But yeah, she definitely needs a hand. I’ve\neven caught her—more than once—showing up\r\nto work with Glimmet tangled up in her hair.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Oh, uh...don’t tell the boss I told you that, yeah?\nShe’d give me the scolding of a lifetime...[VAR 0114(0013)]
Let’s keep it between you an’ me, OK?[VAR 0114(0013)]
It’s fun teaching the students here, but I’ll be\nhonest—all the thinking’s tiring sometimes![VAR 0114(0013)]
I gotta switch to, like, my professional mode,\ny’know? It’s exhausting.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Slap on those glasses to look all sharp and\neverything. They’re just for show, to be honest.\r\nI don’t need ’em to see.[VAR 0114(0013)]
You saw me in professional mode, right? For the\ninterview thing?[VAR 0114(0013)]
Which do you prefer? Professional-mode Rika, or\nRika as-is?[VAR 0114(0013)]
Rika as-is!
Professional-mode Rika!
Oooh, that so? Then when I’m around you, I’ll\nloosen up as much as I can and just be myself![VAR 0114(0013)]
Oooh, is that so?!\c\nIn that case, perhaps you’d prefer I interact with\nyou in a more polite, refined manner?\c\nHeh! Gotcha.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Anyhoo, I’ll keep what you said in mind![VAR 0114(0013)]
Hey—we’re talkin’ an awful lot these days, aren’t\nwe?[VAR 0114(0013)]
I feel like we’re gettin’ to know each other pretty\nwell. Why don’t we do something to celebrate?[VAR 0114(0013)]
Oh, I know! Why don’t we trade Pokémon?[VAR 0114(0013)]
Great! That settles it, then. Now, ol’ Rika’s gonna\nput up a Wooper to trade! Whatcha got for me?[VAR 0114(0013)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]I like [VAR 0101(0001)]—I like it a lot! I’ll take\ngood\r\ncare\r\nof\r\nit,\r\npromise!\c\nYou’d better mark today on your calendar—it’s a\nspecial day when you get to trade with ol’ Rika![VAR 0114(0013)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]So, you’re ready to trade your [VAR 0101(0001)]\nfor\r\nmy\r\nWooper?[VAR 0114(0013)]
You can’t trade Rika a Pokémon if you aren’t\nits original Trainer!
You can’t trade Rika such a rare Pokémon!
You can’t trade Rika a Shiny Pokémon!
Hey, you only have one Pokémon with you! You\nneed at least two on your team, kiddo![VAR 0114(0013)]
Sure you wanna leave me hangin’? Wouldn’t want\nme to go tradin’ with someone else, would ya?[VAR 0114(0013)]
You ready to trade Pokémon with ol’ Rika?[VAR 0114(0013)]
What’s up, kiddo? In the mood for a battle?[VAR 0114(0013)]
Aw, that’s no fun! Well, lemme know whenever\nyou need an opponent![VAR 0114(0013)]
Hope you’re ready for a pummeling, then!\nYou better go all out![VAR 0114(0013)]
[~ 58]
How’d you manage to get even BETTER at\nbattling than before? No way I can beat you![VAR 0114(0013)]
Guess that’s what it takes to catch the boss’s\nattention like you have, eh.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Well, you beat ol’ Rika, which means you deserve\nsomething special![VAR 0114(0013)]
I’m not gonna stay down, y’know. You’re in for a\nnasty surprise if you think I’ll just keep losing![VAR 0114(0013)]
[~ 58]
Impressive as always, beating ol’ Rika like that!\nCongrats![VAR 0114(0013)]
Gettin’ beat by you is frustrating and all, sure.\nBut I still feel kinda refreshed afterward![VAR 0114(0013)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Whaddya say, [VAR 0100(0000)]?!\nThat’s\r\nwhat\r\nol’\r\nRika\r\ncan\r\ndo\r\nwhen\r\nshe\r\nsets\r\nher\r\nmind\r\nto it!\c\nBet you won’t underestimate me again, huh?\nHope you battle me again sometime![VAR 0114(0013)]
Say, you’re not doing anything too risky in Area\nZero, are you?\c\nIf you’re taking too many chances, ol’ Rika’s\ngonna put a stop to it, y’hear?[VAR 0114(0013)]
Being in a clubroom like this reminds me of when\nI was a student.\c\nI went to kind of a rough school, though, so the\nclubrooms were never this clean and tidy.[VAR 0114(0013)]
The kids in the League Club keep bringin’ me\nsnacks and drinks and stuff. They’re all so polite\r\nand considerate![VAR 0114(0013)]
[VAR BD06(0000)][VAR 0101(0001)] is doin’ well! I’m taking good\ncare\r\nof\r\nit,\r\ndon’t\r\nyou worry.[VAR 0114(0013)]
The Wooper I traded you is a cutie with the\nUnaware Ability!\c\nHe’s a fun contrast to someone like me who’s\nfully aware of her good looks, eh?[VAR 0114(0013)]

I got an invite, so here I am![VAR 0114(0014)]
Poppy of the Paldea Elite Four, at your service![VAR 0114(0014)]
Hi, mister! I’m here! I’m here![VAR 0114(0014)]
Hi, miss! I’m here! I’m here![VAR 0114(0014)]
I’m glad you could come!
You didn’t get lost on the way?
Hehe![VAR 0114(0014)]
Some nice people from the League flew over\nwith me to make sure I got here OK![VAR 0114(0014)]
This is my first time in another region! I really\nwanna go play, but...[VAR 0114(0014)]
I know I’m here to teach the Bloo-berry people\nabout Pokémon, so that’s what I’m gonna do![VAR 0114(0014)]
The students will love you!
That’s so nice of you, Poppy!
Hee hee! Yeah, I think I got this![VAR 0114(0014)]
It’s me again! I came ’cause you asked me to![VAR 0114(0014)]
Schools are such fun places, aren’t they?[VAR 0114(0014)]
I’ve never been to school and classes and stuff\nbefore![VAR 0114(0014)]
All the classrooms and the teachers! It’s so\nexciting![VAR 0114(0014)]
Do you think I’ll ever get to go to school like\nother kids...?[VAR 0114(0014)]
Yeah, absolutely!
I don’t see why not...?
...Yeah! You’re right, mis[VAR 1100(00FF,0103)]ters![VAR 0114(0014)]
I think I’m a bit different from other kids... It\nmakes me worry sometimes![VAR 0114(0014)]
Thanks for cheering me up, mister![VAR 0114(0014)]
Thanks for cheering me up, miss![VAR 0114(0014)]
Hi, mister![VAR 0114(0014)]
Hi, miss![VAR 0114(0014)]
How old do I look to you, mister?[VAR 0114(0014)]
How old do I look to you, miss?[VAR 0114(0014)]
Six years old?
Nine years old?
Twelve years old?
Heeey! I’m not that much of a baby![VAR 0114(0014)]
Oh wow! You’re the first person to get it right![VAR 0114(0014)]
Ohhh! Do I look that grown-up?[VAR 0114(0014)]
I’m nine years old—that’s old enough to go to\n[VAR 1107(00FF,0206)]NaranjUva Academy if I wanted to![VAR 0114(0014)]
But my Pokémon are too strong... I didn’t want\nto go to school ’cause I was afraid I’d scare the\r\nother kids...[VAR 0114(0014)]
And then Geeta said I could join the Elite Four...[VAR 0114(0014)]
But then I saw the students here at Bloo-berry\nAcademy and I realized something![VAR 0114(0014)]
I’m not a weird kid! I’m just really good at\nPokémon battles![VAR 0114(0014)]
So next year I’m gonna be an Elite Four member\nAND a student![VAR 0114(0014)]
That’s so exciting!
We can study together!
Yeah, it’s gonna be so much fun![VAR 0114(0014)]
I can’t wait to start studying at [VAR 1107(00FF,0206)]NaranjUva Academy![VAR 0114(0014)]
But I think I need to practice making friends...[VAR 0114(0014)]
So do you wanna trade Pokémon with me?[VAR 0114(0014)]
Thanks! I think I’ll trade Tinkatuff—which cutie\nare you gonna trade?[VAR 0114(0014)]
[VAR BD06(0000)][VAR 0101(0001)] is a real solid Pokémon! It’s\nthe\r\nbest!\c\nI’ll take extra good care of it, mis[VAR 1100(00FF,0103)]ters![VAR 0114(0014)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]So are we gonna trade your [VAR 0101(0001)]\nand\r\nmy\r\nTinkatuff?[VAR 0114(0014)]
You can’t trade Poppy a Pokémon if you aren’t its\noriginal Trainer!
You can’t trade Poppy such a rare Pokémon!
You can’t trade Poppy a Shiny Pokémon!
Wait a minute! You shouldn’t trade if you’ve only\ngot one Pokémon with you!\c\nYou’re only allowed to trade if you’ve got at\nleast two on your team![VAR 0114(0014)]
OK! But we’ll trade Pokémon sometime soon,\nright?[VAR 0114(0014)]
Are you ready to trade Pokémon with me?[VAR 0114(0014)]
Oooh! Do you wanna have a Pokémon battle with\nme?[VAR 0114(0014)]
I’m ready anytime you want, mis[VAR 1100(00FF,0103)]ters![VAR 0114(0014)]
Yaaay! I’m not gonna hold back at all, OK?[VAR 0114(0014)]
[~ 72]
Agh! I wanted to de-feet you in an avenge match![VAR 0114(0014)]
But I won’t cry. I’m an Elite Four member after all![VAR 0114(0014)]
You beat my Tinkie, so you get some candies![VAR 0114(0014)]
I’m gonna have a candy, too—and try even\nharder next time![VAR 0114(0014)]
[~ 72]
Hmph! You made me go all mmmuuuggghhh\nagain![VAR 0114(0014)]
But next time I’m gonna de-feet you! I promise![VAR 0114(0014)]
Yaaay! I did it! I de-feet-ed you!\c\nYou can come for...for...an avenge match? Come\nfor an avenge match anytime you want, mis[VAR 1100(00FF,0103)]ters![VAR 0114(0014)]
The Terarium is full of Pokémon I’ve never ever\nseen before! I had no idea there were so many\r\nPokémon in the world![VAR 0114(0014)]
The cafeteria’s Academy Special is really good!\c\nI couldn’t finish it all, but I put the leftovers in my\nbag! I’ll have them on the flight back home![VAR 0114(0014)]
Did you know there’s a Steel-type Elite Four\nmember here at Bloo-berry?\c\nThat means she’s just like me! Yaaay![VAR 0114(0014)]
[VAR BD06(0000)][VAR 0101(0001)] is so amazing! It’s got real solid\nparts\r\nand\r\npointy\r\nbits\r\nand\r\neverything![VAR 0114(0014)]
I hope the Tinkatuff I traded you is behaving!\nMaybe you already evolved her into a Tinkaton?[VAR 0114(0014)]
