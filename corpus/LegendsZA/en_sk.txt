Bunu!
Yo! Remember me? ’Cause I sure remember you.\nYou were a big help with that big ol’ Bunnelby.[VAR 0114(0126)]
But all I could do back then was stand back and\nwatch you battle the beast, completely useless.[VAR 0114(0126)]
And that feeling lit a FIRE in my heart![VAR 0114(0126)]
I wanted to be just as strong as you are![VAR 0114(0126)]
I’ve actually been working pretty darn hard since\nthen.\c\nI realized I had to start over from scratch, both as\na Trainer and as a traveler.[VAR 0114(0126)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Now it’s time to see the results!\n[VAR 0100(0000)]!\r\nThis\r\ntime\r\nyou’re\r\ngonna\r\nbattle ME![VAR 0114(0126)]
I’ll show you what I can do with the team of buds\nI’ve built up big ol’ bonds with![VAR 0114(0126)]
Oooh, I’m getting chills. Or maybe these are\npre-battle jitters?\c\nAnyway, you just tell me when you’re ready for a\nbig ol’ battle![VAR 0114(0126)]
[~ 9]
From the fact that you’re talking to me, I take it\nyou’re all ready for battle?[VAR 0114(0126)]
Ready as I’ll ever be!
Not exactly
OK! Then shall we get this show on the road?[VAR 0114(0126)]
BUNAAAL!
Here we go...[VAR 0114(0126)]
WITNESS...[VAR 0114(0126)]
OUR BIG OL’...[VAR 0114(0126)]
BOOONDS!!![VAR 0114(0126)]
[~ 19]
C’mon, Bunnelby! Our bond is the biggest and\ngreatest of all! Let’s show ’em![VAR 0114(0126)]
[~ 21]
You’ve gotta admit, catching and raising all those\nalphas sure was a big endeavor, right?[VAR 0114(0126)]
There’s just something about alphas. It’s like\nthey’re overflowing with nature’s power![VAR 0114(0126)]
I wonder if the whole world used to be overrun\nwith alphas way back when... Can you imagine?[VAR 0114(0126)]
There’s so much to see and discover out there...\nIt fills me with wonder!\c\nI was born and raised here in Lumiose, but that\nwonder is what got me traveling in the first place.[VAR 0114(0126)]
Now I know there are new discoveries still waiting\nfor me, even back home.[VAR 0114(0126)]
It sorta made me realize something, y’know?[VAR 0114(0126)]
Doesn’t matter if you’re in some foreign land or\nyour own backyard. Every day can be a journey!\c\nWhat’s important is what you get out of your\nexperiences, wherever you are.[VAR 0114(0126)]
I think I’ll enjoy a bit more time here at home and\nsee where the journey of life takes me.[VAR 0114(0126)]
Bun bun!
Thanks for the battle, pal. Someday I’ll manage to\nbeat you—you’ll see![VAR 0114(0126)]

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Oh, it’s you! Thank you again for giving me that\nPikachu back then.[VAR 0114(0125)]
Thunder Stones really are wondrous, aren’t they?\nI just adore my Raichu![VAR 0114(0125)]
Alola![VAR 0114(016A)]
And thanks for the Pokémon trade, of course! The\nRaichu you gave me is such a delight.[VAR 0114(016A)]
But today, the two of us aren’t here to ask you for\nanother favor—but rather to do one for you.[VAR 0114(016A)]
Because we’re here to show you...[VAR 0114(0125)]
Raichu’s Mega Evolutions![VAR 0114(016A)]
We can’t show off Mega Evolution without a\nbattle, so let us know when you’re ready for one![VAR 0114(0125)]
[~ 8]
Are you ready to battle us so we can show off our\nMega-Evolved Raichu duo?[VAR 0114(0125)]
Are you ready to battle us so we can show off our\nMega-Evolved Raichu duo?[VAR 0114(016A)]
I’m ready!
Not now
Oh gosh, really? But I’m just dying to show you\nmy Raichu’s Mega Evolution![VAR 0114(0125)]
Then allow us to demonstrate...in battle! Behold\nthe Mega Evolutions of Raichu![VAR 0114(0125)]
And I really wanted to show you MY Mega-\nEvolved Raichu![VAR 0114(016A)]
Yes, we’ll certainly show you how Raichu can\nMega Evolve in this battle![VAR 0114(016A)]
Look! Our Raichu![VAR 0114(0125)]
They’re both so big! They’re alpha-sized![VAR 0114(016A)]
[~ 19]
Transform into Mega Raichu X and let loose the\nelectromagnetism from your twin tails![VAR 0114(0125)]
Allow me to battle you on behalf of the\nMega Raichu Y Promotion Committee![VAR 0114(016A)]
[~ 22]
No wonder you came out on top—you’re an\namazing Z-A Royale Trainer![VAR 0114(0125)]
That was just what I’d expect from the Trainer\nwho saved Lumiose City from certain doom.[VAR 0114(016A)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]It seems we’ve got to thank you once again,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0125)]
It’s thanks to you that our Raichu duo was born.[VAR 0114(016A)]
As an expression of my appreciation, I’d like to\ngift you with this Raichunite X stone...[VAR 0114(0125)]
And please have this Raichunite Y stone from me![VAR 0114(016A)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]I hope we meet again someday,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0125)]
Alola![VAR 0114(016A)]
[~ 31]
Oh! If it isn’t [VAR 0100(0000)] again![VAR 0114(0125)]
What fantastic timing! We were actually just\ntalking about you.[VAR 0114(016A)]
You were?
Why’s that?
We were just reminiscing on how much we and\nour Raichu all owe you![VAR 0114(016A)]
Here I am with the lovely Raichu I evolved from\nyour Pikachu by using a Thunder Stone on it![VAR 0114(0125)]
And here I am with the Raichu I received from you\nin our fortunate trade![VAR 0114(016A)]
You see, we happened to pass one another on the\nstreet and stopped to admire each other’s Raichu.[VAR 0114(0125)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Once we got to talking, we realized we both have\nyou to thank for them,\r\n[VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(016A)]
Then we got so caught up in our excitement that\none thing led to another and...well, that’s how the\r\nultimate Raichu duo came to be![VAR 0114(0125)]
We never would have found each other if it\nweren’t for you and the magic of this city![VAR 0114(016A)]
Biggah-biggahhh!
I’m going to use a Thunder Stone on every single\nPikachu I come across!\c\nJust kidding, of course! I would never do that.\nNot me.[VAR 0114(0125)]
All I need in my life is Raichu, and I’m set![VAR 0114(016A)]
[~ 46]
I wonder which of the two is more wonderful—\nMega Raichu X or Mega Raichu Y?[VAR 0114(0125)]
Oh, my dear Tracie! The world knows that all\nRaichu are perfectly wonderful![VAR 0114(016A)]
Biga!
Biggah!

You there, young Trainer. Could I ask a special\nfavor of you?[VAR 0114(01A6)]
I’d like you to deliver this letter to the director of\nAcadémie Étoile.[VAR 0114(01A6)]
I would do it myself, but I’m afraid that certain\ncircumstances prevent me from doing so.[VAR 0114(01A6)]
Please. Won’t you deliver it in my stead?[VAR 0114(01A6)]
Of course I will
This seems...fishy
If you doubt my intentions, I suggest you deliver\nthe letter. Then you will see the truth of the whole\r\nmatter for yourself.[VAR 0114(01A6)]
Merci! I knew you had a trustworthy face.[VAR 0114(01A6)]
This is the letter that must be delivered.[VAR 0114(01A6)]
Remember, you must give it to the director of\n[VAR FF00(0006)]Académie Étoile[VAR FF00(0000)]. No one else![VAR 0114(01A6)]
[~ 10]
Oh, I remember you...\c\nYou helped me find my ring before, didn’t you?\nI did so appreciate your help then.[VAR 0114(0127)]
And what new good deed has brought you to\nAcadémie Étoile today?[VAR 0114(0127)]
I’m looking for the director
I’ve come with a letter
A letter...for the director? Well, you’ve found her.\nI am the director of this school.[VAR 0114(0127)]
You gave the Important Letter to Moire!
Where...where did you get this letter?[VAR 0114(0127)]
No, never mind that—there is an even more\nurgent question that must be answered.[VAR 0114(0127)]
Please. Won’t you come to Vert Sector 6 with me?\nI must visit [VAR FF00(0006)]Racine Construction[VAR FF00(0000)] at once.[VAR 0114(0127)]
Oh, thank you for coming.[VAR 0114(0127)]
[~ 21]
Thank you for coming. I feel so much better\nhaving you here with me for support.[VAR 0114(0127)]
I probably should have done this alone, but that\nletter you gave me... It raised so many questions.\c\nI suppose I ought to tell you what it said.[VAR 0114(0127)]
“I’m so sorry. I left you behind without ever having\nthe chance to tell you something.\c\n“Fourteen years ago, I entrusted my precious ring\nto a certain man for repairs.\c\n“The man’s name was Tarragon—the owner of a\nshop called Racine Construction.”[VAR 0114(0127)]
Receiving a letter from my deceased husband...\nIt’s simply impossible, isn’t it?\c\nI was afraid to come by myself to find out if what\nthis letter says is true or not.[VAR 0114(0127)]
Are you...Mr. Tarragon?[VAR 0114(0127)]
That I am. How can I help ya?[VAR 0114(0010)]
Tell me...\c\nDo you remember a man coming to you 14 years\nago, asking for your help repairing a ring?[VAR 0114(0127)]
That I do![VAR 0114(0010)]
I’d gone and taken my little Canari to a fancy\nrestaurant to celebrate her birthday.[VAR 0114(0010)]
We hit it right off with the guy sittin’ next to us.\nCanari took to him like a Ducklett to water.[VAR 0114(0010)]
When he heard what a dab hand I was at fixin’\nthings, he asked if I could help with settin’ a\r\nstone that’d come loose from a ring of his.[VAR 0114(0010)]
Told me it was a special ring—one of a pair he\nand his wife had exchanged.[VAR 0114(0010)]
That man was my husband. But I’m afraid there\nwas an accident, and he...he...[VAR 0114(0127)]
I’m so sorry to hear that, ma’am.[VAR 0114(0010)]
But what a stroke of luck that somethin’ pointed\nyou here after all these long years.[VAR 0114(0010)]
I’d hoped perhaps...that ring...\c\nAh, and I’m sure I owe you something for your\nlabor.[VAR 0114(0127)]
There ain’t no need for that, ma’am.[VAR 0114(0010)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]\nI can’t take this kind lady’s money.\c\nBut maybe...I could take a battle with young\n[VAR 0100(0000)] instead. How ’bout it,\r\nkid?[VAR 0114(0010)]
I’ll be waitin’ in the garage, if yer up for it![VAR 0114(0010)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Oh please, [VAR 0100(0000)], won’t you\ngive\r\nthe\r\ngentleman\r\nhis\r\nbattle?\r\nI\r\ncan’t\r\nstand\r\nleaving\r\nthis\r\ndebt\r\nunpaid.[VAR 0114(0127)]
[~ 42]
That stick-in-the-mud Grisham’s been teachin’ me\nmore than just bakin’!\c\nWe’ve been battlin’ plenty, too. I’ll show ya some\nof the tricks I’ve picked up![VAR 0114(0010)]
I’ll still win!
Hold on...
Look, I can’t give that nice lady her ring back\nunless ya pay for it—with a worthy battle![VAR 0114(0010)]
Let’s get this Pokémon battle goin’![VAR 0114(0010)]
[~ 48]
Come on, Excadrill! Time to show this kid what\nyer drill can do!
[~ 50]
Ha! Ain’t that just typical. But admit it—me and\nExcadrill gave you a run for yer money, eh?\c\nWe all owe ya big-time, kid. Growin’ stronger to\nput up a real challenge in battle’s just my small\r\nway of showin’ ya my appreciation.[VAR 0114(0010)]
Well, consider me paid in full, ma’am. I think it’s\nhigh time this ring made its way back home.[VAR 0114(0010)]
[VAR 0100(0000)]...[VAR 0114(0127)]
You handed over the Cherished Ring!
I was so distraught when I lost my husband and\nwe never found his ring...\c\nBut now our two rings are back together at last.\nI’ll treasure them and all my memories of him.[VAR 0114(0127)]
Goodness—you’ve found both my own lost ring\nand my husband’s ring!\c\nYou truly are a wonder, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0127)]
Gotta admit it’s a weight off my shoulders too,\nhavin’ that ring back where it belongs![VAR 0114(0010)]
[~ 58]
I had a wonderful dream the other night.\c\nI was having the most delightful time talking with\nmy darling, back in the days when we first met...[VAR 0114(0127)]

There’s a rumor going around among us couriers.[VAR 0114(01A7)]
You know the Dormez Bien Cemetery? I’ve heard\none of the gravestones moves around at night![VAR 0114(01A7)]
What’s even weirder is that my courier friends say\nit only happens under certain conditions![VAR 0114(01A7)]
One: It has to be nighttime.[VAR 0114(01A7)]
Two: You can only have one Pokémon with you.[VAR 0114(01A7)]
Three: You have to enter the cemetery from the\nnorthern gate.[VAR 0114(01A7)]
Four: You have to say these magic words in your\nhead... Solitary solo cemeteries are sorta scary.[VAR 0114(01A7)]
Could you see if the rumor is true? I’m too scared\nto try it myself...[VAR 0114(01A7)]
OK, so to recap—four things need to happen for\nthe gravestone to move.\c\nOne: It has to be nighttime.\c\nTwo: You can only have one Pokémon with you.\c\nThree: You must enter the cemetery from the\nnorthern gate.\c\nFour: You have to repeat these magic words...\nSolitary solo cemeteries are sorta scary.[VAR 0114(01A7)]
[~ 9]
How do the magic words begin?
Cemeteries are...
Sorta...
Solitary...
After that?
Sorta...
Cemeteries are...
Solo...
Next?
Scary...
Cemeteries are...
Solitary...
And then?
Scary...
Sorta...
Solitary...
And finally?
...Cemeteries!
...Solo!
...Scary!
Hmm... That doesn’t seem right.
Some Pokémon appeared!
[~ 32]
Really?! I’m on my way right now![VAR 0114(01A7)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Thanks for investigating the rumor,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(01A7)]
So there was no moving gravestone, huh? Just a\nHoundstone and some Greavard?[VAR 0114(01A7)]
Well, glad to know that’s all there was to it.[VAR 0114(01A7)]
...Wait.\c\nWhere the heck did the Greavard and Houndstone\ncome from?[VAR 0114(01A7)]
And to be surrounded by Greavard and\nHoundstone in a solitary cemetery at night...[VAR 0114(01A7)]
sounds sorta scary![VAR 0114(01A7)]
[~ 40]
So you got surrounded by Greavard and\nHoundstone in a cemetery at night...\r\nThat sounds sorta scary![VAR 0114(01A7)]

There’s only one Pokémon with a body made of\nplasma that lets it infiltrate appliances...[VAR 0114(01A8)]
We’re talking about Rotom, of course![VAR 0114(01A9)]
I see you have a Rotom Phone![VAR 0114(01A8)]
Rotom Phones are very valuable! After all, there\ncan’t be an infinite supply of them. There aren’t\r\nenough Rotom in the world for that![VAR 0114(01A9)]
Rotom Phones are amazing, yes, but Rotom truly\nshines when it enters a household appliance![VAR 0114(01A8)]
Want to battle different forms of Rotom as it\npossesses various appliances?[VAR 0114(01A8)]
If so, just let me know![VAR 0114(01A8)]
I wonder what appliances Rotom will take over![VAR 0114(01A9)]
[~ 8]
Are you ready to battle against Rotom’s different\nforms?[VAR 0114(01A8)]
Yeah!
Not yet
Don’t leave us in suspense! Please, battle Rotom![VAR 0114(01A8)]
Presenting the amazing, awe-inspiring Rotom!\nWatch as it inspirits all sorts of appliances!\r\nIntroducing our first Rotom...[VAR 0114(01A8)]
I wonder what appliances Rotom will take over![VAR 0114(01A9)]
[~ 15]
Heat Rotom! That’s the name for a Rotom when it\npossesses a microwave oven like this![VAR 0114(01A8)]
Heat Rotom is an Electric- and Fire-type Pokémon!\nAnd look—it’s no longer a Ghost type![VAR 0114(01A9)]
In this form, it can learn the move Overheat![VAR 0114(01A8)]
If Heat Rotom’s happy, your food will come out\ncrisp and juicy. If not...I hope you like it burnt![VAR 0114(01A9)]
In this Pokémon battle, I’ll be showing you the\nbest Rotom has to offer![VAR 0114(01A8)]
[~ 21]
Could you feel the HEAT from Heat Rotom?![VAR 0114(01A8)]
Next—Wash Rotom! That’s what we call a Rotom\nthat possesses a washing machine![VAR 0114(01A8)]
I’m awash with excitement![VAR 0114(01A9)]
[~ 25]
Wash Rotom is an Electric- and Water-type\nPokémon![VAR 0114(01A8)]
In this form, it can learn the move Hydro Pump!\nJust thinking about it PUMPS me up![VAR 0114(01A9)]
It’s very considerate—it’ll only start washing a\nload of laundry if you’ve added detergent to it![VAR 0114(01A8)]
But there’s always the risk of it flooding your\nhome![VAR 0114(01A9)]
[~ 30]
I bet Wash Rotom washed away any doubts you\nhad about it![VAR 0114(01A8)]
Coming up, we’ve got a Rotom that has seized\ncontrol of a lawn mower...Mow Rotom![VAR 0114(01A8)]
This is the mow-ment we’ve all been waiting for![VAR 0114(01A9)]
[~ 34]
Mow Rotom is an Electric- and Grass-type\nPokémon![VAR 0114(01A8)]
In this form, it can learn the move Leaf Storm![VAR 0114(01A9)]
The only question is whether you have a lawn big\nenough for it to mow.[VAR 0114(01A8)]
It swaggers around as it scatters grass clippings\neverywhere... What a mischief-maker![VAR 0114(01A9)]
[~ 39]
Mow Rotom’s mowing power is mow-st\nimpressive, huh?[VAR 0114(01A8)]
Next in line is Fan Rotom! That’s the name for a\nRotom that has taken over a fan![VAR 0114(01A8)]
How fan-tastic![VAR 0114(01A9)]
[~ 43]
Fan Rotom is an Electric- and Flying-type\nPokémon![VAR 0114(01A8)]
In this form, it can learn the move Air Slash![VAR 0114(01A9)]
And since Rotom understands voice commands,\nordering it to use that move is a breeze![VAR 0114(01A8)]
But it’s also quite the prankster... You never know\nwhen it’ll blow your important documents away![VAR 0114(01A9)]
[~ 48]
I’m sure Fan Rotom absolutely blew you away too![VAR 0114(01A8)]
And last but not least, Frost Rotom! That’s what\nRotom is called when it takes over a refrigerator.[VAR 0114(01A8)]
That’s so cool, it gives me the chills![VAR 0114(01A9)]
[~ 52]
Frost Rotom is an Electric- and Ice-type Pokémon![VAR 0114(01A8)]
In this form, it can learn the move Blizzard![VAR 0114(01A9)]
It wreaks havoc by freezing everything around it!\nThat doesn’t really sell you on it, huh...[VAR 0114(01A8)]
By the way, I hear Rotom’s form changes have\nsomething to do with its special motor![VAR 0114(01A9)]
[~ 57]
I was such a motormouth talking up Rotom that I\nhardly noticed the battle had ended![VAR 0114(01A8)]
In the Galar region, you can find Rotom hard at\nwork as Drone Rotom and Rotom Bikes too.[VAR 0114(01A8)]
But remember: Rotom is a prankster to the core![VAR 0114(01A9)]
Rotom’s antics while it’s inhabiting an appliance\ncan be difficult to keep under control.[VAR 0114(01A8)]
A Trainer like you would probably have no trouble\nmastering all its forms in battle, though![VAR 0114(01A9)]
That’s why we’re happy to present you with a\ncatalog you can use to change Rotom’s form![VAR 0114(01A8)]
Try using that catalog if you ever catch a wild\nRotom somewhere.[VAR 0114(01A8)]
I’m sure Rotom will take on even more forms as\nnew devices and appliances are invented.[VAR 0114(01A8)]
In other words, Rotom’s possibilities are endless!\nInfinite Rotom... What an inspiriting idea![VAR 0114(01A9)]
[~ 67]
Have you been using the Rotom Catalog to\nchange Rotom’s form?[VAR 0114(01A8)]
You never know... One of these days you might\nfind Rotom wreaking havoc with your appliances![VAR 0114(01A9)]
Bzzz-zzzrt!

I aim to create a superb new galette that will\ntranscend even the mighty Lumiose Galette![VAR 0114(01AB)]
Yet there is a problem with my superb plan...[VAR 0114(01AB)]
I don’t have a wonderfully gallant Pokémon to\nhelp present my superb galettes to customers.[VAR 0114(01AB)]
But the very name of our café is Café Gallant![VAR 0114(01AB)]
Perhaps wanting to be seen as gallant is behind\nthe times, but it IS in the name of our café...\c\nI want to respect our history and the desires that\nwent into that name.[VAR 0114(01AB)]
Forgive me—I suppose I got off topic there...\c\nThe point is that I want a gallant and classy\nPokémon who can help deliver my superb\r\ngalettes to customers with style![VAR 0114(01AB)]
Please help me get that most gallant of Pokémon,\nthe effortlessly cool Indeedee![VAR 0114(01AB)]
[~ 7]
Do you have an Indeedee you can give me?[VAR 0114(01AB)]
I’ve got one!
Not yet...
Truly?! Oh, having an Indeedee here would be\nworth any number of human workers![VAR 0114(01AB)]
Oh, please! I must have an Indeedee! I am\nconvinced it is the only Pokémon that’ll do![VAR 0114(01AB)]
If only I had a gallant Indeedee...
[~ 14]
Yes! The gallantry! It simply pours off of Indeedee!\nThis is exactly it![VAR 0114(01AB)]
Yes! The gallantry! All Indeedee are most gallant.\nGal-lant, you might say in this case![VAR 0114(01AB)]
Now, to prepare my superb Lumiose Galette that\nshall transcend standard Lumiose Galettes![VAR 0114(01AB)]
I shall call them...Giga Lumiose Galettes! That’s\nright, we’re skipping right over Mega!\c\nThis is the kind of brilliant thinking and decisive\naction that is needed to be truly gallant![VAR 0114(01AB)]
Indeedee! Please present our customer with\nsome Giga Lumiose Galettes.[VAR 0114(01AB)]
Oh. Hmm. They’re so large that there is no room\nto serve coffee or anything else alongside them...[VAR 0114(01AB)]
Perhaps gallantry should know some limits.[VAR 0114(01AB)]
But at least I still get to see Indeedee’s gallant\nservice—and that’s something to celebrate![VAR 0114(01AB)]
Indee.
Indeedee! Together you and I shall bring further\nglory to Café Gallant![VAR 0114(01AB)]
[~ 25]
Since my Giga Lumiose Galette turned out too big,\nI’m reconsidering the Mega Lumiose Galette...[VAR 0114(01AB)]
Indee.

You ever get the feeling someone’s staring at you?[VAR 0114(01AC)]
Yeah, that’s creepy
You’re staring at me
Yes. I need your help. You will help, won’t you?[VAR 0114(01AC)]
I have this new neighbor. She just moved here\nfrom the Paldea region.[VAR 0114(01AC)]
She brought her Pokémon with her.[VAR 0114(01AC)]
And it just keeps STARING at my poor Scizor![VAR 0114(01AC)]
My Scizor’s not exactly the bravest of Scizor.\nSince they moved in, every day has been a terror![VAR 0114(01AC)]
Please! Can you find out why my new neighbor’s\nTinkatuff keeps staring at my poor Scizor?![VAR 0114(01AC)]
Sci...
I think you’ll find that new neighbor of mine up\non the rooftops.[VAR 0114(01AC)]
[~ 11]
Um... Yes? Can I help you with something?[VAR 0114(01AD)]
You see, your Tinkatuff...
Your neighbor’s Scizor...
Oh! Is this about the Scizor that lives next door?[VAR 0114(01AD)]
I know, I know. I keep catching my Tinkatuff\nstaring at it.[VAR 0114(01AD)]
I think Tinkatuff’s just a bit afraid and is feeling\non edge. Scizor DOES have an intimidating look.[VAR 0114(01AD)]
But I suppose being stared at all the time is also\nintimidating in its own way, isn’t it?[VAR 0114(01AD)]
I’m so sorry you got dragged into this. Could you\nlet my neighbor know there’s no harm intended?[VAR 0114(01AD)]
Tink...
[~ 21]
So? Why does that Tinkatuff keep staring at my\nScizor?[VAR 0114(01AC)]
Scizor looks intimidating
It’s scared of your Scizor
What?! So it’s staring at my poor, frightened\nPokémon because it thinks Scizor looks scary?[VAR 0114(01AC)]
What?! So that Tinkatuff is scared of my Scizor—\nand Scizor is simultaneously scared of Tinkatuff?[VAR 0114(01AC)]
I mean...it’s not like Scizor can change its face.\nThat’s just the way it looks.[VAR 0114(01AC)]
Even if it IS scared, doesn’t it realize how scary it\nis to be constantly stared at like that?![VAR 0114(01AC)]
What has happened to my peaceful home life?!\c\nEverything was fine until that weird Pokémon\nmoved in next door![VAR 0114(01AC)]
Come to think of it, don’t people say Tinkatuff\nlikes to attack other Pokémon to steal their metal?\c\nWhat if...what if it’s got its eyes on my Pokémon\nbecause of Scizor’s Steel type?![VAR 0114(01AC)]
Zorrr?!
Don’t worry, Scizor! I’ll protect you with my life if I\nhave to![VAR 0114(01AC)]
My poor Scizor won’t be able to rest easy like this!\nWho knows if we can trust that lady’s Pokémon?![VAR 0114(01AC)]
Look—I’m sure she’s got her own things going\non, having just moved here and all, but please...\r\ncan you get her to understand our feelings too?![VAR 0114(01AC)]
Sci...
[~ 36]
Back again from that neighbor of mine?[VAR 0114(01AD)]
His Pokémon’s afraid of yours
Your Tinkatuff is scaring them
HIS Pokémon is afraid? That’s what he told you?[VAR 0114(01AD)]
My Pokémon is scaring them? But it’s such a\nsweetheart! They don’t even know Tinkatuff![VAR 0114(01AD)]
My sweet Tinkatuff would never attack another\nPokémon just to get more metal.[VAR 0114(01AD)]
Well, almost never.[VAR 0114(01AD)]
Tuff!
We’re the ones who just moved in here. WE’RE\nthe ones who are uneasy. And THEY’RE saying\r\nwe’re scary?![VAR 0114(01AD)]
Then I want proof that my neighbor’s Scizor isn’t\nglaring at Tinkatuff to intimidate it![VAR 0114(01AD)]
Tink...
[~ 48]
So? What’d she say now?[VAR 0114(01AC)]
She doesn’t quite trust your Scizor
She says you can trust Tinkatuff
Who could doubt my sweet and timid Scizor?!\nThere’s not a threatening bone in its body![VAR 0114(01AC)]
She SAYS that, but talk is cheap. All’s well and\ngood till Tinkatuff gives Scizor an iron deficiency![VAR 0114(01AC)]
Look, I get that it’s gotta be scary moving to a\nnew region and all, but...but we live here too![VAR 0114(01AC)]
Well, I don’t see any choice but to prove to her\nthat my Scizor is perfectly innocent and not scary![VAR 0114(01AC)]
How will you do that?
You think you can?
We’ll just have to get Scizor and Tinkatuff to know\neach other face-to-face![VAR 0114(01AC)]
Though I’d feel a lot better if you were there too...[VAR 0114(01AC)]
Go ask my neighbor if she’s game. If she is, we\ncan both bring our Pokémon to meet![VAR 0114(01AC)]
Zorrr...
[~ 62]
He wants Tinkatuff and Scizor to get to know\neach other?[VAR 0114(01AD)]
All right![VAR 0114(01AD)]
Tinkatuff and I have also been stressed about this\nwhole situation.[VAR 0114(01AD)]
Let’s meet up and prove once and for all that my\nPokémon is no threat to that Scizor![VAR 0114(01AD)]
We can do that—right, Tinkatuff?[VAR 0114(01AD)]
Tink!
[~ 69]
OK. Now that we’re all here, let’s introduce our\nPokémon to each other.[VAR 0114(01AC)]
And if anything starts to look dicey, we call them\nboth into their Poké Balls.[VAR 0114(01AD)]
This way, Scizor![VAR 0114(01AC)]
Over here, Tinkatuff![VAR 0114(01AD)]
Your Tinkatuff seems rather...bashful.[VAR 0114(01AC)]
Scizor...does seem rather scared.[VAR 0114(01AD)]
Tink! ♪
Zorrr...
Tinkatuff doesn’t show any sign of attacking.[VAR 0114(01AC)]
And Scizor only looks a bit scary, but it really isn’t\nscary at all.\c\nI guess they assumed the worst of each other,\ndidn’t they?[VAR 0114(01AD)]
Zor!
Tuff!
Our Pokémon are looking friendlier already![VAR 0114(01AC)]
Yes. And I hope we can be friends as well!\c\nI’m still adjusting to Lumiose. It would be nice to\nhave someone I can ask for help.[VAR 0114(01AD)]
It was nice of this Trainer to go out of h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]iser way to\nhelp some strangers like us.[VAR 0114(01AD)]
Oh! Tinkatuff, no! Don’t go ripping the metal off\nthose chimney pipes![VAR 0114(01AD)]
Th-this’ll be fine...right?[VAR 0114(01AC)]
Sci...
Tuff!
[~ 89]
I’ve been talking more with Herrera, and our\nPokémon have both been getting along well.\c\nSo far.[VAR 0114(01AC)]
Sciii...
Acier has been teaching me so much about life in\nLumiose! He’s going to be such a great help.\c\nAnd my little Tinkatuff can hardly keep its mitts\noff of its new pal Scizor![VAR 0114(01AD)]
Tinka!

More! MORE! I need even more heat![VAR 0114(013B)]
Restaurant Le Yeah will be stuck at two stars\nforever if we can’t get more firepower![VAR 0114(013B)]
That’s why I’ve thought of the perfect way to get\nus that third star.[VAR 0114(013B)]
Some SERIOUS HEAT![VAR 0114(013B)]
You look puzzled, my friend. Allow me to explain![VAR 0114(013B)]
We’re going to offer the spiciest dishes made for\nspice lovers by a true spice lover. It’s gonna be...[VAR 0114(013B)]
A SPICE FIESTA![VAR 0114(013B)]
But your everyday spicy dishes aren’t going to\nimpress the most intense of heat seekers.[VAR 0114(013B)]
So I’m going to need a special assistant to make\nthis event a success!\c\nPlease, you’ve just got to bring me the Pokémon\nknown as [VAR FF00(0006)]Scovillain[VAR FF00(0000)]![VAR 0114(013B)]
If I can get Scovillain to use its [VAR FF00(0006)]Spicy Extract[VAR FF00(0000)] move\non my dishes, we’ll be able to produce the kind of\r\nheat that discerning spice maniacs all seek![VAR 0114(013B)]

Don’t be shy! There’s no need to hold back. All\nthese people want that Spicy Extract!\c\nOr did you want to talk to me about something?[VAR 0114(013B)]
Nope, just let me at ’em!

I understand. Not everyone can take this kind of\nheat for long.\c\nBut come back when you’re ready for more, and\nwe can see this Spice Fiesta to its glorious end![VAR 0114(013B)]

Allow me to evaluate if your\nspice is really worth trying.
Bring it on, kid!
The stimulating kick of that extract certainly has\nme feeling spicier![VAR 0114(0017)]
That’s a kick in the head![VAR 0114(0010)]
I don’t know how to describe this heat! It’s like\nthere’s a fire raging within me![VAR 0114(0017)]
You know, this is makin’ me think a super-spicy\nvariety of Canari Bread could be a big seller...[VAR 0114(0010)]

The whole family is here and\nready to feel the burn together!
But I don’t like\nspicy foods...
Spice is nice!\nSpice is nice!

GO, SCOVILLAIN!!!
Amazing, Scovillain!
This heat! It’s like I’ve\ndied and gone to heaven!

Whoa! I don’t know why,\nbut I feel pumped up!

Douse me in that\nSpicy Extract!
SPICY EXTRACT!
That was the first time in my life\nI’ve felt something was TOO spicy!

Yes! Yes! This is it! THIS IS IT!
Huh. I was hoping for a harder\nkick than this, to be honest.

The Spice Fiesta should be a famed\nevent that draws folks to Lumiose!
Disappoint me, and I’ll make sure\nthis place is left with just one star!
What a fiery move! It’s off the scale!
The heat seems to blast right\nthrough the top of my skull!
I think the day Le Yeah gets\nits third star isn’t far off now!

O-oh! You’re right! I think I might\nbecome a Scovillain fan now!
The aroma is so intoxicating!\nI just adore Scovillain!

[VAR BD06(0000)]Oh! Hello, you’re [VAR 0100(0000)],\nright?[VAR 0114(01AE)]
My favorite streamer in the whole world posted\nthis photo the other day! Just LOOK at it![VAR 0114(01AE)]
It’s too good, right? Canari just chilling on a\nbench with her Eelektross, looking AMAZING.[VAR 0114(01AE)]
I want to sit on the exact same bench and get my\nown shot with Manectric![VAR 0114(01AE)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]So I could really use your help,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(01AE)]
Help me find that bench![VAR 0114(01AE)]
Bowzzz!
[~ 7]
Do you want to see the bench in the photo again?[VAR 0114(01AE)]
Yeah, let me see
I think I’m good
Here you go! Do you recognize the bench?[VAR 0114(01AE)]
I really hope you can help me find it![VAR 0114(01AE)]
[~ 13]
You’ve found the specific bench that Sasse was\nlooking for!
It’s got the two planters in a row! The same\nbuildings in the background! And the mountains![VAR 0114(01AE)]
This has to be where Canari took her photo![VAR 0114(01AE)]
C’mon, no time to waste![VAR 0114(01AE)]
Don’t I look just like Canari, sitting here on the\nsame bench she sat on?[VAR 0114(01AE)]
Can I ask just one more teeny tiny thing of you,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]?\c\nCan you take a picture of me looking just like\nCanari did in the photo I showed you?[VAR 0114(01AE)]
I want it to be from exactly the same angle![VAR 0114(01AE)]
I can show you Canari’s picture again anytime,\nso let me know if you want to![VAR 0114(01AE)]
Do you want to check Canari’s photograph?[VAR 0114(01AE)]
I absolutely do![VAR 0114(01AE)]
Not really[VAR 0114(01AE)]
Go on! Try to create a little distance and get me a\npicture just like Canari’s![VAR 0114(01AE)]
[~ 26]
Yeah, I think you’ve got it! The right place should\nbe somewhere around there...[VAR 0114(01AE)]
Or maybe not.\c\nThe angle’s off, isn’t it? I really want it to be the\nperfect recreation of Canari’s shot![VAR 0114(01AE)]
[~ 29]
Yes! There! Take a picture from right there![VAR 0114(01AE)]
All right, let’s see if you managed to pull it off...[VAR 0114(01AE)]
Ohmygosh! It’s PERFECT! I look JUST like Canari![VAR 0114(01AE)]
I’m uploading now, aaand... There! It’s up![VAR 0114(01AE)]
Hey, I wonder who took that picture for Canari?\c\nCould it be that mysterious manager of hers?\nApparently he’s really involved in her work...[VAR 0114(01AE)]
I guess we have him to thank for having Canari\nBread and everything.\c\nThey’re not bad! But I’d really rather have Canari\nkey chains or...oooh, an acrylic standee![VAR 0114(01AE)]
Maybe someday! Anyway, I’d love to re-create a\nbunch more of Canari’s pics while I’m in Lumiose.[VAR 0114(01AE)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Thanks for your help, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nMaybe\r\nhave\r\na\r\nseat\r\non\r\nthat\r\nbench\r\nand\r\ntake\r\na\r\nload off![VAR 0114(01AE)]

Hey there. I’m an indie game dev. Name’s Trian.[VAR 0114(01AF)]
And I’m a real pro when it comes to the mighty\npolygon.[VAR 0114(01AF)]
You know the mighty Porygon?[VAR 0114(01AF)]
Wait, mighty Porygon or polygon?
Did your tongue just glitch?
Both, kid! I’m versed in the Pokémon AND in the\nclosed 2D shapes made of straight lines![VAR 0114(01AF)]
No! I’m trying to tell you about polygons! Y’know,\nclosed 2D shapes made of straight lines?\c\nThey’re used in 3D computer graphics, and\nPorygon is basically a collection of ’em![VAR 0114(01AF)]
See, the games you play are full of these 3D\ncharacters, which we in the biz call models.[VAR 0114(01AF)]
They’re created through a process called\npolygonal modeling.[VAR 0114(01AF)]
Polygon models are made by sticking together\ntons of little polygons to make a 3D image![VAR 0114(01AF)]
The more polygons you use—and the tinier they\nare—the smoother and rounder a model ends up.[VAR 0114(01AF)]
In the old days, it took tons of processing power\nto use tons of polygons, so most models looked\r\nall blocky and funny, with lotsa angles.[VAR 0114(01AF)]
People say that the Pokémon Porygon was made\nusing the most advanced tech at the time, right?\r\nBut technology is always advancing.[VAR 0114(01AF)]
Which brings me to the real reason for my talk.[VAR 0114(01AF)]
Trade me one of your Porygon for one of mine![VAR 0114(01AF)]
[~ 15]
Will you trade me one of your Porygon for mine?[VAR 0114(01AF)]
Sure, let’s trade
Not right now
I hope you’ll reconsider. Trading Porygon can lead\nto a real groovy experience![VAR 0114(01AF)]
Great! Let’s trade Porygon![VAR 0114(01AF)]
Come on, please! Trade me a Porygon in exchange\nfor mine![VAR 0114(01AF)]
No, I said PORYGON! I’m pretty sure I spoke\nclearly.[VAR 0114(01AF)]
Oh! It looks like it’s about to get...smoother?!
How’d you like my little surprise?[VAR 0114(01AF)]
Yeah, I gave the Porygon I sent you an Upgrade to\nhold.[VAR 0114(01AF)]
Which made it evolve into Porygon2![VAR 0114(01AF)]
See how smoothly rounded it is now? It’s the\nperfect illustration of how much games change\r\nwhen processing power improves![VAR 0114(01AF)]
Porygon2’s upgrades include AI, and it was even\nprogrammed for planetary development projects.[VAR 0114(01AF)]
Porygon and its line are a bit of a handful to deal\nwith, but I still can’t help but love it.[VAR 0114(01AF)]
Hm? Wait, that flash just now...[VAR 0114(01AF)]
Did you have your Porygon hold an Upgrade too?[VAR 0114(01AF)]
I was trying to surprise you, but you surprised me!\nWhat a great trade this turned out to be! Thanks![VAR 0114(01AF)]
[~ 33]
Maybe Porygon2 is ready for another upgrade...[VAR 0114(01AF)]
Pory?

Did you ever notice the Pokémon designs on our\nutility hole covers here in Lumiose?[VAR 0114(01B1)]
I call them Pokémon lids![VAR 0114(01B1)]
And you’ve just found one![VAR 0114(01B1)]
This is one of the Vert District’s famed Gogoat\nutility holes![VAR 0114(01B1)]
Now, how about a little quiz?[VAR 0114(01B1)]
What Pokémon is depicted on utility holes found\nin the Rouge District?\c\nGuess the Pokémon you think you’ll see there,\nthen show me that Pokémon![VAR 0114(01B1)]
[~ 9]
Are you ready to show me the Pokémon featured\non utility hole covers in the Rouge District?[VAR 0114(01B1)]
I’m ready!
Hold on
If you think you know the answer, bring that\nPokémon the next time you come talk to me![VAR 0114(01B1)]
Show me which Pokémon you think is on those\nutility holes.[VAR 0114(01B1)]
Come on now, show me the right Pokémon! Don’t\nyou believe you can find it?[VAR 0114(01B1)]
Sorry! Bad call![VAR 0114(01B1)]
A male Pyroar... Oooh, that’s so close, but it’s not\nthe right answer![VAR 0114(01B1)]
A female Pyroar...[VAR 0114(01B1)]
Da-da-da-daaaaah! ♪[VAR 0114(01B1)]
That is the correct answer! Amazingly done![VAR 0114(01B1)]
Each series of Pokémon utility holes has a theme.\nThe Rouge District’s theme is “determination.”\r\nFemale Pyroar are just perfect to represent that![VAR 0114(01B1)]
In case you’re curious, the theme in the Vert\nDistrict is supposed to be “camaraderie.”\c\nThe Bleu District’s theme is said to be “modesty,”\nMagenta should be “grace,” and Jaune, “joviality.”[VAR 0114(01B1)]
Perhaps you should take the time to look down\nand notice the utility holes sometime.\c\nThough take care to look at what’s ahead of you\ntoo![VAR 0114(01B1)]

I don’t dislike Option 2 and Option 3 per se. I just\nthink Option 1 is the way to go.[VAR 0114(01B2)]
Both Option 1 and Option 3 lack impact. I think\nwe should go with my suggestion: Option 2.[VAR 0114(01B3)]
My proposal, Option 3, is the most fitting of all.\nBut you two just refuse to budge, don’t you?[VAR 0114(01B4)]
Well then, how about we ask this young person\nhere for h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]iser opinion?[VAR 0114(01B2)]
Now there’s a good idea at last! We’re getting\nnowhere just going round in circles ourselves.[VAR 0114(01B3)]
You there! Young [VAR 1100(00FF,0403)]manlady! Could you give us a hand?[VAR 0114(01B4)]
See, this street needs a new name—one that will\nreally grab people’s attention.[VAR 0114(01B3)]
We want to draw more visitors to our street with\na name that captures the imagination.[VAR 0114(01B3)]
So why don’t you help us decide? After all, this\ntown will belong to your generation someday.[VAR 0114(01B4)]
We each came up with our own idea.[VAR 0114(01B2)]
My idea is [VAR FF00(0006)]Lumiose Grand Avenue[VAR FF00(0000)].\c\nI know it’s a bit too grand for this little old street,\nbut that’s how we’ll entice people to visit![VAR 0114(01B2)]
My proposal is [VAR FF00(0006)]Mega Evolution Road[VAR FF00(0000)].\c\nOf course, there’s not really anything around here\nrelated to Mega Evolution, but isn’t it evocative?[VAR 0114(01B3)]
I’m suggesting [VAR FF00(0006)]Borevard Boulevard[VAR FF00(0000)].\c\nWe might as well tell people what they’re in for,\nand this little boulevard is as boring as they come.[VAR 0114(01B4)]
They’ve all got their selling points, but none is the\nclear winner.\c\nIt’s like going around in a circle between Fire,\nWater, and Grass types![VAR 0114(01B2)]
What do you think? Which name would you pick?[VAR 0114(01B3)]
[~ 15]
Have you decided? Do you know which name\nwould be perfect for our street?[VAR 0114(01B2)]
I’ve got it
Let me think...
Oh! Well, let’s hear it at once! Which of our ideas\nis the winner?[VAR 0114(01B3)]
Option 1: Lumiose Grand Avenue
Option 2: Mega Evolution Road
Option 3: Borevard Boulevard
I’ve got an even better idea
Lumiose Grand Avenue!\c\nYes! It may be a bit exaggerated now, but in time\nour road will surely grow to deserve such a name![VAR 0114(01B2)]
Mega Evolution Road, yes!\c\nAnd in time, people will probably come up with\ntheir own stories about how Mega Evolution grew\r\nand developed in this area![VAR 0114(01B3)]
Yes! Borevard Boulevard!\c\nThat is the only possible name for this street![VAR 0114(01B4)]
Y-you want to throw out all our suggestions and\ngo back to the drawing board?![VAR 0114(01B4)]
[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0002)]![VAR 0114(01B3)]
I think it’s perfect![VAR 0114(01B2)]
I agree.[VAR 0114(01B3)]
I feel just the same! Nothing boring about that\nidea![VAR 0114(01B4)]
Then from this day onward, this street shall be\nknown as [VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0002)]![VAR 0114(01B3)]
From this day forward, this street’s name shall be\nLumiose Grand Avenue![VAR 0114(01B3)]
From this day forward, this street’s name shall be\nMega Evolution Road![VAR 0114(01B3)]
From this day forward, this street’s name shall be\nBorevard Boulevard![VAR 0114(01B3)]
I hope everyone in Lumiose soon adopts it.[VAR 0114(01B4)]
[~ 37]

You... Wait a tick—aren’t you the Trainer known\nas [VAR 0100(0000)]? From Team MZ?[VAR 0114(01B5)]
Yeah, you got me
People always think that, but no
I knew I recognized you.[VAR 0114(01B5)]
Oh, no need to be shy. I understand all too well\nthe burden of fame. Your secret is safe with me.[VAR 0114(01B5)]
I wonder if I could trouble a renowned Trainer\nsuch as yourself with a trifling request.[VAR 0114(01B5)]
I am an auteur, you see—a writer of great novels.\nNot that my talent is appreciated by the masses...\c\nBut I’ve got just the idea for my next manuscript![VAR 0114(01B5)]
The only element I lack is the dramatis personae.\nA famed Trainer like you could round out my cast\r\nand provide the inspiration I’ve been looking for.[VAR 0114(01B5)]
I have an idea for the Pokémon my tale shall\nrequire. Could you assemble them for me?[VAR 0114(01B5)]
First, we must have a Ground-type Pokémon.\nNext, a Pokémon that knows Flamethrower.\r\nFinally, a Pokémon bearing a Mega Stone![VAR 0114(01B5)]
I must see all three! Then my creative juices will\nsurely runneth over.\c\nCould you put the trio in your party and come\nshow me? I can repeat my list whenever you like.[VAR 0114(01B5)]

First, a Ground-type Pokémon.[VAR 0114(01B5)]
Second, a Pokémon that knows Flamethrower.[VAR 0114(01B5)]
And finally, a Pokémon bearing a Mega Stone.[VAR 0114(01B5)]
I must see all three if I’m to write my great novel.\c\nCould you put the Pokémon I need in your party\nand come show me? I can repeat my list anytime.[VAR 0114(01B5)]
You haven’t even got three Pokémon! I can’t\npossibly write my story if I haven’t seen all three.\r\nDo you think I just make this stuff up?[VAR 0114(01B5)]
It seems you have the requisite number of\nPokémon, at least. But will they fit the bill?[VAR 0114(01B5)]
First things first. Which is your Ground-type\nPokémon?[VAR 0114(01B5)]

It is to be an adventure novel, you see.\c\nSince you’ve been so integral to the whole thing,\nI don’t mind giving you a little preview of the plot.[VAR 0114(01B5)]
Our tale begins deep in the wilds of the Kalos\nregion...[VAR 0114(01B5)]

It’s no mere love triangle—it’s an endless love\nloop! What do you think? Brilliant, isn’t it?[VAR 0114(01B5)]
How romantic![VAR 0114(01B5)]
Uh... Seriously?[VAR 0114(01B5)]
Ah, no, wait—this won’t do. An endless love loop\noffers no resolution![VAR 0114(01B5)]
I do have one other idea, I suppose. It’s a bit more\ninvolved...but you’ll hear me out, won’t you?[VAR 0114(01B5)]
Sure I will
No, thanks
Oh, what a spoilsport you are! You showed me all\nyour Pokémon but don’t want to hear my idea?[VAR 0114(01B5)]
Please lend me your ear, dear friend.[VAR 0114(01B5)]
Once, in the city of Lumiose, there existed two\ncompeting schools dedicated to the martial arts.[VAR 0114(01B5)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]One was founded by [VAR 0102(0004)],\ndistinguished\r\nby\r\nhard,\r\nunyielding strikes.\c\nThis style was known as the Path of\n[VAR 018B(0001)].[VAR 0114(01B5)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]The other was founded by\n[VAR 0102(0005)],\r\nspecializing\r\nin\r\nfleet,\r\nflowing\r\nmovements.\c\nThis style was known as the Way of\n[VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(01B5)]
Both schools put their desire to become strongest\nabove all else in life.\c\nTheir members vowed to have nothing to do with\nthe other style—except in battle.[VAR 0114(01B5)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]All who followed the Path of [VAR 018B(0001)]\nwere\r\nbound\r\nto\r\nview\r\nthe\r\nWay\r\nof\r\n[VAR 0100(0000)]’s\r\nfollowers\r\nas\r\nmortal\r\nfoes.\r\nAnd vice versa.\c\nGoverned by that one unbreakable tenet, it was a\nhard-knock life in these schools of hard knocks...[VAR 0114(01B5)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]It came to pass that a match was declared:\n[VAR 0102(0002)]\r\nof\r\nthe\r\n[VAR 018B(0001)]\r\nstyle\r\nversus\r\n[VAR 0102(0003)]\r\nof\r\nthe\r\n[VAR 0100(0000)] style.\c\nThis battle would decide once and for all which\nschool was strongest.[VAR 0114(01B5)]
Everything was on the line. Whichever school\nwas defeated would be honor bound to disband.\c\nYet the two Pokémon selected as the schools’\nchampions had a singular problem...[VAR 0114(01B5)]
[VAR BD06(0000)][VAR 0102(0002)] and\n[VAR 0102(0003)]\r\nwere\r\ndesperately\r\nin love.\c\nThey had broken the one rule that must never be\nbroken, meeting in secret outside of battle.[VAR 0114(01B5)]
On the night before the fateful match was to\nbe held...[VAR 0114(01B5)]
[VAR BD06(0000)][VAR 0102(0002)] and\n[VAR 0102(0003)]’s\r\neyes\r\nmet—they\r\nknew\r\nthere\r\nwas\r\nbut\r\none\r\noption!\r\nTogether,\r\nthey\r\nfled\r\ninto\r\nthe night![VAR 0114(01B5)]
So begins their thrilling story of love on the lam,\ntheir very lives on the line as they flee pursuit![VAR 0114(01B5)]
I have to admit my own experience with romance\nIS limited, so perhaps my novel will lack realism...\r\nBut I think it will be a tale for the ages, don’t you?[VAR 0114(01B5)]

Ah, if it isn’t my muse, back again! Thank you for\nyour help with my romance novel.\c\nIt’s been optioned for a film! Do you know who\nthey’ve signed on as leads? Brycen and Sabrina![VAR 0114(01B5)]
Wait, what?!
Whoa, congrats!
For my next tale, I’m thinking...a mystery novel!\nI’d love to have your help once again.[VAR 0114(01B5)]
I have an idea for the Pokémon my tale shall\nrequire. Could you assemble them for me?[VAR 0114(01B5)]
First, I think we’ll need an alpha Pokémon again.\nSecond, a Normal-type Pokémon.\c\nThe third should be a Dark-type Pokémon.\nThe fourth should know the move Teleport...\c\nAnd the fifth must be a Fighting-type Pokémon.\nCan you show me all those?[VAR 0114(01B5)]
I’m counting on you, my muse!\c\nCould you put those five in your party and come\nshow me? I can repeat my list whenever you like.[VAR 0114(01B5)]
[~ 7]
Have you brought me the five precise Pokémon I\nneed for my next novel?[VAR 0114(01B5)]
I’ve brought them
Tell me your list again
Not quite yet...
I’m asking you to assemble five particular\nPokémon for me this time.[VAR 0114(01B5)]
First, I think we’ll need an alpha Pokémon again.[VAR 0114(01B5)]
The second should be a Normal-type Pokémon.[VAR 0114(01B5)]
The third should be a Dark-type Pokémon.[VAR 0114(01B5)]
The fourth really must know the move Teleport.[VAR 0114(01B5)]
And the fifth must be a Fighting-type Pokémon.[VAR 0114(01B5)]
I’ll need all five to complete my perfect novel.\c\nCould you put them in your party and come show\nme? I can repeat my list whenever you like.[VAR 0114(01B5)]
You don’t even have five Pokémon! My gripping\ntale cannot be woven if I don’t see all five arrive.[VAR 0114(01B5)]
It seems you have the requisite number of\nPokémon, at least. But will they fit the bill?[VAR 0114(01B5)]
Let us start off strong. Which is our alpha\nPokémon?[VAR 0114(01B5)]
[VAR 0102(0002)]
[VAR 0102(0003)]
[VAR 0102(0004)]
[VAR 0102(0005)]
[VAR 0102(0006)]
[VAR 0102(0007)]
Never mind
I wish for you to show me an ALPHA Pokémon.\nI feel I’ve been quite clear on this point.[VAR 0114(01B5)]
[VAR BD06(0000)][VAR 1303(0008,0000)][VAR 0101(0008)]! Quite the choice. Oh yes,\nthis\r\nis\r\nsparking\r\nsome ideas...[VAR 0114(01B5)]
Next, we need a Normal type. Which of your\nPokémon will fill that role?[VAR 0114(01B5)]
That is not a Normal-type Pokémon. I said I need\na Normal type![VAR 0114(01B5)]
[VAR BD06(0000)][VAR 0101(0009)]! Wonderful! There’s\nnothing\r\nnormal\r\nabout\r\nhow\r\ninspired it makes me feel![VAR 0114(01B5)]
Then onto our next character. Which will be the\nDark-type Pokémon in this scenario?[VAR 0114(01B5)]
It simply must be a Dark-type Pokémon. That is\nwhat this tale of mystery demands.[VAR 0114(01B5)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Yes! [VAR 1303(000A,0000)][VAR 0101(000A)]! The scenes are\ncoming\r\ninto\r\nsharp\r\nfocus\r\nnow![VAR 0114(01B5)]
Which is our fourth character—the Pokémon that\nknows the move Teleport?[VAR 0114(01B5)]
Please, it must know Teleport. I insist![VAR 0114(01B5)]
[VAR BD06(0000)][VAR 0101(000B)]! Yes! The lines\npractically\r\nwrite\r\nthemselves![VAR 0114(01B5)]
And the fifth character? Which is our Fighting-\ntype Pokémon in this battle of wits?[VAR 0114(01B5)]
Please! I must have a Fighting-type character![VAR 0114(01B5)]
And [VAR 1302(000C,0000)][VAR 0101(000C)]! Perfect!\c\nYou’ve managed to assemble the ideal cast of\ncharacters for me! I cannot thank you enough.[VAR 0114(01B5)]
Now allow me to sketch out the plot of my grand\nmystery novel...[VAR 0114(01B5)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Our setting is a mansion deep in the mountains\nof the Kalos region.\c\nIt is owned by famed millionaire\n[VAR 0102(0002)].[VAR 0114(01B5)]
It also currently houses three guests...and a\ncertain treasure.[VAR 0114(01B5)]
The first of the guests is a Trainer by the name of\n[VAR 0102(0003)].[VAR 0114(01B5)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Then there is our millionaire’s former flame,\n[VAR 0102(0004)],\r\nand\r\na\r\njewel\r\ncollector\r\nnamed\r\n[VAR 0102(0005)].[VAR 0114(01B5)]
The mansion’s butler, [VAR 018B(0001)], is unobtrusive yet\never present, seeing to all the guests’ needs.[VAR 0114(01B5)]
One evening, the guests are all called together to\na very special room of the mansion.[VAR 0114(01B5)]
This room serves as a giant safe, so fortified that\nthe move Rage Fist would not crack its defenses.\r\nSo explains the butler, [VAR 018B(0001)].[VAR 0114(01B5)]
In the safe’s center, lovingly displayed in pride of\nplace, shines the grandiose jewel known only as...\r\n“[VAR 0102(0006)]’s Tear.”[VAR 0114(01B5)]
This mythical treasure is rumored to have been a\ngift from the former king of the land, AZ.\c\nThe mansion’s owner gazes upon it regularly—\nevery morn and eve—to sustain their spirits.[VAR 0114(01B5)]
The sun has barely risen the morning after this\nshowing...when a terrible howl echoes through\r\n[VAR 0102(0002)]’s mansion.[VAR 0114(01B5)]
The guests gather in front of the safe room that\ncontained the treasure, drawn by the awful noise.\c\nAnd there the millionaire cries out, “My treasure\nhas been stolen!”[VAR 0114(01B5)]
“One of my guests must have done it!”[VAR 0114(01B5)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Resenting the accusation, [VAR 0102(0004)]\ndemands,\r\n“Why\r\nus?\r\nWhy\r\nnot your butler?”[VAR 0114(01B5)]
But the butler [VAR 018B(0001)] has a cast-iron alibi—[VAR 1100(00FF,0001)]she’d\nbeen playing cards with h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]eris employer all night.[VAR 0114(01B5)]
[VAR BD06(0000)][VAR 0102(0003)] and\n[VAR 0102(0005)]\r\nreadily\r\nagree\r\nto\r\na\r\nsearch\r\nof\r\ntheir\r\npersons\r\nand belongings.[VAR 0114(01B5)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]But even after the butler inspects all the guests,\nthere’s still no trace of the stolen jewel.\c\nOnly [VAR 0102(0003)] was found\ncarrying\r\nanything...\r\nNo\r\nmore\r\nthan\r\na\r\nPoké Ball—a\r\nperfectly\r\nnormal\r\nitem\r\nfor\r\na\r\nPokémon\r\nTrainer\r\nto have.[VAR 0114(01B5)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]So who stole the treasure known as\n[VAR 0102(0006)]’s\r\nTear?[VAR 0114(01B5)]
[VAR 0102(0003)]
[VAR 0102(0004)]
[VAR 0102(0005)]
Tsk-tsk. Really? Was the trick a bit too difficult for\nyou to work out?[VAR 0114(01B5)]
Haha! How typical of you to have seen right\nthrough all my tricks, my masterful muse![VAR 0114(01B5)]
The evil Trainer had left one of their Pokémon in\nthe room to wait until everyone was gone so it\r\ncould steal the treasure for its master!\c\nWhen everyone began to gather at the room the\nnext morning, this larcenous lout quietly called\r\nthe Pokémon back to its Poké Ball, concealing\r\nboth it and the treasure to cover their tracks![VAR 0114(01B5)]
Wonderful, isn’t it? Such a bold and elaborate\nsetup, worthy of a criminal genius![VAR 0114(01B5)]
It’s a masterpiece!
Isn’t it a bit obvious?
Hmm. Now that I think about it, I wonder if I\nsomehow overlooked a weakness in my airtight\r\nplot? That would be disappointing.[VAR 0114(01B5)]
Yet it’s all thanks to your tireless support that\nI’ve been able to craft such creative novels.\c\nYou must be my greatest fan, willing to go so far\nabove and beyond to support my writing career![VAR 0114(01B5)]
To show my gratitude, I’d be happy to remix any\nof my tales for you, featuring whatever different\r\nPokémon you wish to cast as the main characters.\c\nJust come speak to me whenever you’re ready to\nexperience more of my masterful storytelling![VAR 0114(01B5)]

Oh! [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(000C)]
Hey Lida, what’s wrong?
That was a serious sigh
Oh, don’t mind me! Just thinkin’ some thoughts.\c\nLike about Ansha! Isn’t she impressive? She made\nher Rayquaza dreams come true...[VAR 0114(000C)]
C’mon, what’s the matter?
Really, you can tell me
Heh. Yeah...well...[VAR 0114(000C)]
I guess I’m just feeling...behind.\c\nRemember what I told you about the friend I was\nrooming with when I first moved here? How she\r\ntried out for a talent agency and got in?[VAR 0114(000C)]
Then there’s my brother—well, half brother.\nWe’ve got different moms.[VAR 0114(000C)]
What about him?
What’s he like?
Well, I’ve never met him or talked to him...but his\nname’s Tierno, and he’s a successful dancer.[VAR 0114(000C)]
All these people in my orbit are achieving their\ndreams, and it’s like...how come I’m not?[VAR 0114(000C)]
It’s OK—you’re doing great
You’ve got nothing to prove
Thanks for saying that. But also, like...you’re a\npretty great Trainer, [VAR 0100(0000)].\c\nConfidence comes more naturally when you’re\nalready doing well, y’know?[VAR 0114(000C)]
Hmm. But maybe...[VAR 0114(000C)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Would you do me a favor and battle with me,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]?\c\nI think a good battle would help me feel more sure\nof myself.[VAR 0114(000C)]
I’ll be at my practice spot. See you there![VAR 0114(000C)]

Hey, [VAR 0100(0000)]. Ready to battle?[VAR 0114(000C)]
Yeah, let’s do it!
Gimme a sec
All right! Ugh, I’m all nervous...[VAR 0114(000C)]
OK! Here goes![VAR 0114(000C)]

Here goes, Starmie! Shine like the star you are!
[~ 28]
Lidaaa! That ruuuled![VAR 0114(0192)]
Korrina?! How long have you been there?[VAR 0114(000C)]
Since right about when your battle started![VAR 0114(0192)]
Why WERE you two battling, anyway?[VAR 0114(0192)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]I’ve been feeling stressed lately. I thought a good\nbattle with [VAR 0100(0000)] might help\r\nme\r\nget\r\nmy\r\ngroove back.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Y’know what I think, Lida? You’re amazing![VAR 0114(0192)]
Huh?[VAR 0114(000C)]
You’re part of Team MZ—the crew that saved all\nof Lumiose![VAR 0114(0192)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]If you can hang with someone as crazy strong as\n[VAR 0100(0000)],\r\nyou\r\nMUST\r\nbe\r\namazing![VAR 0114(0192)]
Plus, you’ve got something that’s all your own—\nyour dancing! You and Starmie move like you\r\nshare one mind![VAR 0114(0192)]
Wow, Korrina... That means a lot.[VAR 0114(000C)]
That stress you’re talking about, Lida? Reminds\nme of when I first took up the mantle of Mega\r\nEvolution successor...[VAR 0114(0192)]
I had to learn so much about Mega Evolution!\nThere’s STILL so much I don’t know![VAR 0114(0192)]
And eventually there’ll be another successor, so I\nhave to figure out what to pass on to them...[VAR 0114(0192)]
But I decided to focus on what I know for sure I\ncan do. That’s helped me keep moving forward.[VAR 0114(0192)]
That’s helpful to hear. Thank you, Korrina.[VAR 0114(000C)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]You too, [VAR 0100(0000)]—you’re a\ngood\r\nfriend.\r\nThank you![VAR 0114(000C)]
Glad I could help! Now I can go back to worrying\nabout my own problem.[VAR 0114(0192)]
What problem’s that?[VAR 0114(000C)]
Mega Evolution is even more mysterious to me\nnow than when I first started!\c\nI wish someone would just tell me its deal!!![VAR 0114(0192)]

On second thought...Ansha may be just the\nperson I need.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Ansha, I was wondering if Hoopa would be able\nto help me with something...[VAR 0114(000B)]
I’m afraid not![VAR 0114(01A5)]
Errr...[VAR 0114(000B)]
Hoopa’s power is not to be misused as anyone’s\npersonal errand service.[VAR 0114(01A5)]
But...but don’t you sometimes—?[VAR 0114(000B)]
I asked Hoopa to help bring my luggage here from\nRichissime because it would have caused a stir if I\r\nhad been seen lugging it through Lumiose myself.[VAR 0114(01A5)]
I’ll tell you what my dear mama taught me: One\nmustn’t expect others to do their work for them.[VAR 0114(01A5)]
I suppose you have a point. I’ve relied a great deal\non [VAR 0100(0000)] and the others.[VAR 0114(000B)]
But sometimes I have to take matters into my own\nhands![VAR 0114(000B)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Help psych me up for it with a battle,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]—an\r\nall-out\r\none![VAR 0114(000B)]
I’ll be outside when you’re ready.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Hoopa and I will come watch. I’d love to see what\nit’s like when Naveen gets serious![VAR 0114(01A5)]
Pi hya hya!

Let’s do this for real, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(000B)]
You’re on!
Give me a minute
This isn’t just about winning—it’s about seeing\nwhat I’m capable of when I try![VAR 0114(000B)]
It’s time for me to test my own mettle...against\none of the strongest Trainers in Lumiose![VAR 0114(000B)]
I have been looking forward to seeing what\nNaveen’s fine Scrafty can do![VAR 0114(01A5)]
Pii hya hya!
[~ 24]
You’ve always helped me out, Scrafty. This time,\nI’ll help you shine![VAR 0114(000B)]
[~ 26]
Knowing your strength, I had a feeling you’d win\nin the end!\c\nStill, I’m proud to know I can go toe to toe with\nyou and give you a tough battle.[VAR 0114(000B)]
You’re both very strong indeed![VAR 0114(01A5)]
But for all your strength, Naveen, you seemed\nreluctant to go back home... May I ask why?[VAR 0114(01A5)]
As happy as I’d be to see my sister...I would really\nprefer not to get another earful from my grandma.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Sorry, Ansha—that must have sounded selfish\nafter how much you’ve been missing your mother.[VAR 0114(000B)]
If seeing your grandmother would really be so\nawful...perhaps it’s all right not to see her?[VAR 0114(01A5)]
What?[VAR 0114(000B)]
I mean... I just...wouldn’t have expected you to\nsay something like that.[VAR 0114(000B)]
You shouldn’t waste your precious time on things\nyou hate doing.\c\nSpend that time bettering yourself instead.[VAR 0114(01A5)]
If your grandmother accepts you after that,\nwonderful—but if not, you can still be proud![VAR 0114(01A5)]
Zaff.
You agree with Ansha, do you, Scrafty?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Well, I can always work on finding ways to use\nmy skills to make my little sister smile.\c\nEven Grandma might appreciate that—she adores\nmy sister.[VAR 0114(000B)]
I’d gladly help! Perhaps I could make your dear\nsister some special donuts.[VAR 0114(01A5)]
I’m sure eventually your grandmother will ease up\nas she sees the care and kindness you bring![VAR 0114(01A5)]
Zaff!
I’ll choose to believe in my design skills—and that\nsomeday they’ll even change my grandma’s mind!\c\nIt would be nice not having to feel so resentful\ntoward her...[VAR 0114(000B)]
Battling you brought me some new confidence,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(000B)]
I’ll keep on chasing my dreams, sewing needle in\nhand...for my sister’s sake, and for all my friends![VAR 0114(000B)]

Get ready to start special scanning![VAR 0114(0013)]
Special?
Scanning?
OK, let me explain.\c\nYou know how pockets of Hyperspace Lumiose\nare still appearing?[VAR 0114(0013)]
Some of ’em are unlike any we’ve seen so far![VAR 0114(0013)]
So we developed a system to locate distortions\nthat lead to these new pockets of hyperspace.\c\nWe call it...the [VAR FF00(0006)]special scan[VAR FF00(0000)] system![VAR 0114(0013)]
Well, I say “we,” but it was the fine eggheads at\nQuasartico who did the developing.[VAR 0114(0013)]
When we run a special scan, it should pinpoint a\nrare distortion that leads to an unknown pocket\r\nof Hyperspace Lumiose![VAR 0114(0013)]
But the system’s not quite ready—which is why I\nneed you.\c\nGo do some hyperspace survey tasks so we can\nget enough data to run a special scan.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Take care of some hyperspace tasks so we’ll have\nenough data to finish the special scan system![VAR 0114(0013)]

Your hard work is much appreciated.[VAR 0114(0014)]

Good work out there.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Let me just plug that data you gathered into the\nsystem...[VAR 0114(0013)]
All done! Now we’re finally ready to make\nsomething happen.[VAR 0114(0013)]
What’re you waiting for? Run a special scan and\nsee if you can find a rare hyperspace distortion![VAR 0114(0013)]
Please talk to me when you’re ready to use the\nspecial scan system.[VAR 0114(0014)]
[~ 20]
Excellent![VAR 0114(0013)]
These pockets of Hyperspace Lumiose are so\nelusive, we can’t find ’em without this scan.\c\nSo there’s a good chance you’ll find some special\nPokémon in there![VAR 0114(0013)]
One thing, though—you’ll have to gather fresh\ndata for each special scan you run.[VAR 0114(0013)]
It’s a lot of work—but hey, it’s you we’re talking\nabout. I know you’re up to the challenge![VAR 0114(0013)]
We’ll need you to earn more research points by\ngathering data in Hyperspace Lumiose before we\r\ncan perform another special scan.[VAR 0114(0014)]

Hey. Sorry to spring this on you, but I need help\nfinding someone.[VAR 0114(01B6)]
I’m looking for a Trainer who uses Dragon types\nand whose partner is a Dragalge.[VAR 0114(01B6)]
This person is tall, has green hair...[VAR 0114(01B6)]
and probably looks pretty wild and tough—like a\nstreet fighter.[VAR 0114(01B6)]
If you know anyone who fits that description,\nplease let me know![VAR 0114(01B6)]
The Trainer I’m looking for uses Dragon types and\nhas a Dragalge for a partner.\c\nThis person is tall, has green hair, and probably\ndresses like a street fighter.[VAR 0114(01B6)]

What do you want?[VAR 0114(0016)]
Uh... What are you wearing?[VAR 0114(01B6)]
Who cares what I’m wearing?! It’s none of your\nbusiness! Yeesh, talk about tactless.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Guess some things never change... Good to see ya\nagain, Marcia.[VAR 0114(0016)]
My Pokémon and I have been training tirelessly to\nfinally take you down, Lebanne.[VAR 0114(01B6)]
Ha! Training hard’s a given for any fighter worth\ntheir salt. I’ve gotten stronger too.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Oh, I’m counting on it—and I’ll beat you anyway!\nThen you’ll have to make good on your promise![VAR 0114(01B6)]
Lebanne. You know that I cannot allow you to\nparticipate in extracurricular, non-SBC activities...\r\nNot without me, of course![VAR 0114(0015)]
Wha—?[VAR 0114(0016)]
We’ve got a score to settle on the battlefield,\nlady—so stay outta the way![VAR 0114(01B6)]
If you wish to battle Lebanne, you will need my\npermission to do so.[VAR 0114(0015)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]\nYou have but one option—\c\nTeam up with [VAR 0100(0000)]\nand\r\nbattle\r\nus\r\ntogether![VAR 0114(0015)]
[~ 19]
It is our responsibility as elites to guide the\nmasses, Clefable![VAR 0114(0015)]

You weren’t kidding about all that training, huh?[VAR 0114(0016)]
Told you so! Though I admit this victory was\nlargely thanks to [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(01B6)]
Still, a win’s a win and a deal’s a deal. Now you\nhave to fulfill the promise you made.[VAR 0114(01B6)]
Lebanne—partner with me![VAR 0114(01B6)]
Yeah, about that...[VAR 0114(0016)]
I’ve already got a partner. I’m sorry, but that’s one\npromise I just can’t keep.[VAR 0114(0016)]
And yet you partnered up with Gwynn...or did I\nimagine that?[VAR 0114(0015)]

I see how it is... Guess I took too long training\nand missed my shot, huh?[VAR 0114(01B6)]
No worries. I get it. And Lebanne...that outfit\nlooks good on you.[VAR 0114(01B6)]

She absolutely must have a [VAR FF00(0006)]Mimikyu[VAR FF00(0000)].[VAR 0114(000E)]
I tried explaining that Mimikyu are nocturnal—\nand perhaps not the best Pokémon for a young\r\nchild to look after.[VAR 0114(000E)]
She replied that if I did not get her one, she would\ninsist I give back my precious hair tie.[VAR 0114(000E)]
Yes, this hair tie is in fact a gift from my daughter.\c\nShe crafted it by hand, felting Mareep wool to\ncreate an adorable work of art.[VAR 0114(000E)]
It is what people know me by. It has become part\nof my very identity. I cannot have her take it back.[VAR 0114(000E)]
Unfortunately, Mimikyu are not found in the Kalos\nregion.\c\nBut perhaps in Hyperspace Lumiose...you might\njust be able to find one there.[VAR 0114(000E)]
If you do find a Mimikyu, please—would you\ncatch it and allow me to gift it to my daughter?[VAR 0114(000E)]

Mimikyu has the Fairy type, making it strong\nagainst Dragon types.[VAR 0114(000E)]
Perhaps someday my daughter will also grow into\na fine Trainer and challenge me and my Drampa...[VAR 0114(000E)]
That will be the true test of my “dadication,” as it\nwere![VAR 0114(000E)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Thank you, [VAR 0100(0000)], for all the\nmany\r\nways\r\nin\r\nwhich\r\nyou\r\naid\r\nme,\r\ngreat\r\nand\r\nsmall![VAR 0114(000E)]

Oh, it’s you.[VAR 0114(000F)]
Y’know, I had this idea for a new ultra-hardcore\ntraining challenge. Wanna try it out?[VAR 0114(000F)]
Don’t worry, the rules are super simple.[VAR 0114(000F)]
You’re stuck in a room with some wild Pokémon\nand you gotta dodge their attacks. That’s it![VAR 0114(000F)]
Easy, right? You can just send out your Pokémon,\nor throw a Poké Ball and try to catch ’em, yeah?\r\nBzzzt. Nope. None of that’s gonna fly.[VAR 0114(000F)]
It’s just you and your reflexes. I call it...the\n[VAR FF00(0006)]Defenseless Dodger[VAR FF00(0000)] challenge!\c\nGimme a shout when you’re feeling brave.[VAR 0114(000F)]
[~ 6]
Ready to leave your Pokémon and Poké Balls\nbehind...and become a Defenseless Dodger?[VAR 0114(000F)]
I am SO ready!
I’m so not ready
Boooo, you’re no fun. Fine. Come back whenever.[VAR 0114(000F)]
Then let’s see if you can last [VAR FF00(0006)]30 seconds[VAR FF00(0000)]!\c\nGet ready for a jolt of high-voltage excitement—\nit’s Defenseless Dodger time![VAR 0114(000F)]
Readyyy...[VAR 0114(000F)]
GO!!![VAR 0114(000F)]
Game over![VAR 0114(000F)]

Dang, check you out! You survived!\c\nChat was eating that up! Come back whenever\nand try to beat your record, yeah?[VAR 0114(000F)]

Excuse me. Do you know if this café here has\nclosed for good?[VAR 0114(01B7)]
I’m pretty sure it has
Yeah, there was a whole thing
Is that right? What a shame...\c\nIt’s my first time back in Lumiose in 10 years, and\nI’d been hoping to have their coffee once more.[VAR 0114(01B7)]
You wouldn’t happen to know where I could find\nthe former owner or anything, would you?[VAR 0114(01B7)]
Well, actually...
I may know someone...
Oh, I’d be grateful to you if you could help me get\nin touch with them![VAR 0114(01B7)]
Who should you ask for more information?
Grisham
Griselle
What could you possibly be calling me for?[VAR 0114(0017)]
Oh, I see. In that case, I suggest you go speak\nwith the head barista at our third truck.[VAR 0114(0017)]
She used to work under the master barista who\nserved at Lysandre Café.[VAR 0114(0017)]
What? You want delivery or something?[VAR 0114(0018)]
You want my help finding some old fart?[VAR 0114(0018)]
Someone who used to make the coffee at\nLysandre Café...\c\nI guess I’d say go talk to the head barista at our\nthird truck.[VAR 0114(0018)]
I’m pretty sure she used to work under Lysandre\nCafé’s old barista.[VAR 0114(0018)]
So if I go to their third truck, I might be able to\nfind out more about this café’s old barista?[VAR 0114(01B7)]
I’ve been by it before. Nouveau Café’s Truck No. 3,\nright? It’s in...the [VAR FF00(0006)]Magenta District[VAR FF00(0000)], isn’t it?[VAR 0114(01B7)]
I’ll head there at once! I do hope you’ll join me in\nthis little quest—you’ve been such a help so far![VAR 0114(01B7)]
[~ 21]
[VAR BD06(0000)][VAR 0100(0000)]! There you are!\nI’m\r\nso\r\nglad\r\nyou\r\ncame![VAR 0114(01B7)]
Let’s see if we can find out anything more about\nthe former barista of Lysandre Café.[VAR 0114(01B7)]
Can I take your order...or are you not here for a\ncoffee? You look like you’ve got other business.[VAR 0114(01B9)]
...I see. And you ended up all the way here, huh?\c\nIt’s true that the old barista at Lysandre Café is\nthe one who taught me all I know.[VAR 0114(01B9)]
I bet he’ll be pleased as punch to hear that a\nformer customer remembers his coffee so fondly.[VAR 0114(01B9)]
I’ll get ahold of him and ask him to go meet you,\nif you’d like to wait outside Lysandre Café.[VAR 0114(01B9)]
Amazing! Then I’ll wait for you both there![VAR 0114(01B7)]
I’ll get ahold of my old teacher and ask him to go\nmeet you at Lysandre Café.[VAR 0114(01B9)]
[~ 30]
Wow, I’m actually a bit nervous about meeting\nthe old barista again, now that we’re here.[VAR 0114(01B7)]
Hey, thanks for waiting for us![VAR 0114(01B9)]
This is the former barista of this café and the man\nwho taught me everything I know—Maît.[VAR 0114(01B9)]
Lovely to meet you. I’m humbled to hear that you\nremembered the taste of my coffee and wanted\r\nanother cup, even after 10 years.[VAR 0114(01B8)]
There’s only one thing preventing me from being\nable to serve you.\c\nI always roasted my beans using Pokémon moves,\nbut I’m rather out of practice.[VAR 0114(01B8)]
I wonder if I could ask your Trainer friend here for\na battle so I can hone my rusty skills?[VAR 0114(01B8)]
I want to battle h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]imer too, Maît![VAR 0114(01B9)]
[~ 38]
Ahhh, yes. Getting to pit my Pokémon’s moves\nagainst the hero who saved our city was just the\r\nthing to bring back those old instincts![VAR 0114(01B8)]
Please, step inside the café with me. I’ll start\npreparing your coffee at once.[VAR 0114(01B8)]
[~ 41]
It’s a bit of a mess right now, but it’s not in that\nbad of shape. I bet with a good cleaning, this\r\nplace could be back in business in no time.[VAR 0114(01B9)]
Indeed... And I shall prepare for our guest a cup\nof my personal blend, just as I made it back then.[VAR 0114(01B8)]
Please have a seat while you wait.[VAR 0114(01B8)]
Yes... Yes, this is exactly it. This is the coffee that\nI remember.[VAR 0114(01B7)]
This rich, bitter aroma that tickles the nose...\nThe deep black shine... The hint of sweetness...[VAR 0114(01B7)]
Maît! You absolute master! It’s just as I remember\nfrom 10 years ago... No, it’s even better![VAR 0114(01B7)]
You’re too kind.[VAR 0114(01B8)]
But I’m afraid I owe you an apology.[VAR 0114(01B8)]
Whatever for?! You’ve prepared me the coffee of a\nlifetime![VAR 0114(01B7)]
That cup you just drank was prepared by me.[VAR 0114(01B9)]
What?![VAR 0114(01B7)]
I was once a barista—it’s true. But I retired from\nthat life after the whole Team Flare debacle.[VAR 0114(01B8)]
But Trois here didn’t want the taste of my coffee\nto be forgotten.[VAR 0114(01B8)]
This city is always changing, but there are some\nthings that simply make Lumiose...well, Lumiose.\r\nMaît’s coffee was one of those things.[VAR 0114(01B9)]
I suppose all of us, people and Pokémon, want to\nleave our mark on the city so that we might be\r\nremembered after we’re gone.[VAR 0114(01B8)]
Yes... Well, I am certainly very glad that I’ll still\nbe able to partake of this coffee I love so much.[VAR 0114(01B7)]
I don’t know when I’ll next be in Lumiose, but I’ll\nfind you to beg for another taste, Trois.[VAR 0114(01B7)]
And I’ll be waiting for your visit, dear customer.[VAR 0114(01B9)]

Sorry, I know this seems a bit rude, but I hope you\ncan forgive me for not turning to speak to you.[VAR 0114(01BA)]
I threw out my back. I think I may have a slipped\ndisc or something...[VAR 0114(01BA)]
It hurts too bad to move. Even trying to shout\nhurts, so I haven’t been able to call for help...[VAR 0114(01BA)]
The last time this happened, I was able to fix my\nback thanks to a certain Pokémon move.[VAR 0114(01BA)]
I think it was called...[VAR FF00(0006)]Octolock[VAR FF00(0000)]?[VAR 0114(01BA)]
I hate to ask, but do you think you could hit me\nwith a good Octolock?\c\nIt’s a move that the Pokémon [VAR FF00(0006)]Grapploct[VAR FF00(0000)] can know.[VAR 0114(01BA)]
You’re...my only hope...[VAR 0114(01BA)]

AHHHHHH!!![VAR 0114(01BA)]
THE PAIN! THE PAIN![VAR 0114(01BA)]
Wait...I feel as if that loosened something up...[VAR 0114(01BA)]
Perhaps Octolock works all the places around the\npain’s source...[VAR 0114(01BA)]
My thrown-out back is hurting less and less now,\nthanks to that Octolock.[VAR 0114(01BA)]
Boy, what a lifesaver that was! And you—you’re so\nkind to help out a stranger![VAR 0114(01BA)]
Of course, that Octolock has some real power.\nMight even hurt more than the back pain did.[VAR 0114(01BA)]
But I’m still grateful! Thanks, Grapploct! You\ncertainly pack one powerful Octolock...[VAR 0114(01BA)]
But I’m still grateful! Thanks, Grapp— Oops, nope.\nI mean to say: Thanks, Malamar!\c\nYou certainly pack one powerful Octolock...[VAR 0114(01BA)]
The thing about a thrown-out back is there’s no\nreal preparing for it.[VAR 0114(01BA)]
It just hits, and suddenly you can’t move.[VAR 0114(01BA)]
You should live life to the fullest and enjoy the\ntime—and mobility—you’ve got![VAR 0114(01BA)]

Arrrrrrb.[VAR 0114(01BE)]
My Seviper here’s named Sevy. A real beaut, eh?[VAR 0114(01BD)]
That’s an Arbok
You think that’s a Seviper?
An Arbok?\c\nYou’re calling this Pokémon right here beside me\nan Arbok? Nonsense! This is clearly a Seviper![VAR 0114(01BD)]
What’s with the doubtful tone, kid?\c\nClearly this Pokémon right here beside me is a\nSeviper! No ifs, ands, or buts about it![VAR 0114(01BD)]
Still...I’m a reasonable fellow. I can admit when\nI’m wrong about something.\c\nSo if you want to insist that this here isn’t a\nSeviper, then you go on and show me a “real” one![VAR 0114(01BD)]

Sevy is 100 percent an Arbok

It’s really not

Goodness, I guess I’d better read up on Arbok\nand make sure I’m caring for Sevy properly.[VAR 0114(01BD)]

Hello, kind Trainer. I’m Trice. I work for the postal\nservice here in Lumiose.[VAR 0114(01BF)]
This Pokémon, Mime Jr., is here to help us collect\nmail from our customers.[VAR 0114(01BF)]
Miii.
But I’ve got one minor concern. You see, this will\nbe Mime Jr.’s first time going out solo.[VAR 0114(01BF)]
I thought about trying to follow along to keep an\neye on things, but I’d be spotted in no time.[VAR 0114(01BF)]
That’s why I’d like to ask for your assistance.\nPlease, look after Mime Jr.’s first big job for me![VAR 0114(01BF)]
If you’re ready and willing to lend a hand, please\nlet me know.[VAR 0114(01BF)]

Are you ready to help watch over Mime Jr.’s first\ntime making the rounds alone?[VAR 0114(01BF)]

I know it’s a lot to ask. But I only want to be sure\nMime Jr. is safe, so I hope you’ll help out![VAR 0114(01BF)]
Thank you so much![VAR 0114(01BF)]
I’ll give Mime Jr. one last set of instructions. You\njust follow along and keep an eye on things.[VAR 0114(01BF)]
Mime Jr.? You remember what to do, right? You’ll\ngather the letters from a yellow postbox like this.[VAR 0114(01BF)]

Ahhh, the Introversion Blend...\nI feel so sophisticated.
Welcome to Introversion, the café for those who\nlike communicating...just maybe not face-to-face.[VAR 0114(01C0)]
YUEGHHH!!!
This coffee... It tastes like it’s been laced with salt!\nLike, a LOT of salt!
What? Our Introversion Blend is known for its\ndelicate sweetness and rich aroma...[VAR 0114(01C0)]
There’s no way it should taste salty, of all things![VAR 0114(01C0)]
Saaal.
That’s the Rock Salt Pokémon, Nacli![VAR 0114(01C0)]
You there! Trainer! Please, help![VAR 0114(01C0)]
Please, can you catch that Nacli?! I’ve got to find\nout if it’s why our coffee is suddenly salty![VAR 0114(01C0)]
Please, catch that Nacli for us![VAR 0114(01C0)]
GROSS! It’s all SALTY!
[~ 12]
There’s that Nacli you’re looking for! Do you want\nto battle it and try to catch it?
Let’s do this!
Not right now
Saaal!
Please, catch that Nacli for me! I’ve just got to\nfind out if it’s why our coffee is suddenly salty![VAR 0114(01C0)]
Who put SALT in my coffee?!

You failed to catch the Nacli...

You caught Nacli!
Did you catch that Nacli? If you did, please bring it\nback to the café![VAR 0114(01C0)]
[~ 24]
Dear customer, I know you reported our coffee\ntasting salty. To you, I present...Nacli.[VAR 0114(01C0)]
Its body is made up of rock salt, which it leaves\nbehind in flakes as it moves around.[VAR 0114(01C0)]
Of course we will replace the drink that you—[VAR 0114(01C0)]
No, no, don’t do that. After a few sips, the taste\nreally started to grow on me. Now I’m hooked!
People do sometimes make coffee drinks with salt\nadded, don’t they?
You should make this salted coffee a part of your\nregular menu!
Wh-what?! I mean...er...yes, fine idea. We’ll\nconsider doing just that.[VAR 0114(01C0)]
A nice aromatic coffee with a dash of Nacli salt...[VAR 0114(01C0)]
I tried to make the perfect blend, but I think it’s\nstill too salty for most people.\c\nI’ll just keep it as a part of our secret menu for\nthose in the know.[VAR 0114(01C0)]
Everyone’s tastes do differ, after all.[VAR 0114(01C0)]
Anyway, I’m relieved to have at least solved the\nmystery of why that drink was so salty. Thanks![VAR 0114(01C0)]
[~ 36]
Everyone’s tastes differ, but I’ll keep striving to\nbrew the perfect coffee loved by all![VAR 0114(01C0)]

Hey, friend! Name’s Thelo! I’ve traveled around all\nkinds of regions, collecting rare Pokémon.[VAR 0114(01C1)]
This one right here is Gimmighoul.[VAR 0114(01C1)]
Gimme.
I got this little box of joy while sightseeing in the\nPaldea region.[VAR 0114(01C1)]
But the thing is, you need Gimmighoul Coins in\norder to evolve a Gimmighoul.[VAR 0114(01C1)]
And not just a few—no [VAR 1100(00FF,0506)]sirreema’am. We’re talking...[VAR 0114(01C1)]
999 COINS![VAR 0114(01C1)]
But I haven’t found a single Gimmighoul Coin\nhere in Lumiose City.[VAR 0114(01C1)]
Help me out, would you? I’ll let you take my\nGimmighoul with you if you’ll evolve it for me![VAR 0114(01C1)]
I can do that
Hold on...
Seriously? Why are people in Lumiose so cold?\nI’m just trying to share the riches of my travels...[VAR 0114(01C1)]
Looks like your Boxes are all full. Let go of one of\nthose other Pokémon for my rare one, won’t you?[VAR 0114(01C1)]
Of course you’d wanna spend some time with a\nrare Pokémon like this one—it’s a total gimme![VAR 0114(01C1)]
You received Gimmighoul!
You received 413 Gimmighoul Coins!
Please evolve my Gimmighoul for me![VAR 0114(01C1)]
Here are all the Gimmighoul Coins I managed to\ncollect in Paldea.[VAR 0114(01C1)]
Come show me once you’ve managed to evolve\nmy Gimmighoul!\c\nYou should be able to evolve it once you’ve got\n999 Gimmighoul Coins![VAR 0114(01C1)]

Once you manage to evolve Gimmighoul, bring me\nthe Pokémon it evolves into![VAR 0114(01C1)]

Whoaaa. It’s...blinding.[VAR 0114(01C1)]
Look. I know this sounds rich coming from me,\nbut I gotta ask...[VAR 0114(01C1)]
Gimme that Gholdengo! Please! Pretty please![VAR 0114(01C1)]
Sure, you can have it
Wait, wait—what?
N-no, never mind... I shouldn’t have even asked...[VAR 0114(01C1)]
Instead, I’ll collect enough coins to evolve a\nGimmighoul on my own![VAR 0114(01C1)]
Let’s golden-GO![VAR 0114(01C1)]
Gholdengo’s brilliance even makes ME shine![VAR 0114(01C1)]
I can’t possibly repay you for all that effort you put\ninto evolving Gimmighoul.[VAR 0114(01C1)]

I managed to get a Gholdengo as my partner, and\nit was all thanks to your hard work!\c\nThanks, friend! I hope my appreciation makes it all\nfeel worth it.[VAR 0114(01C1)]

Corbeau, sir![VAR 0114(0005)]
What?[VAR 0114(0013)]
I wanted to thank you properly for letting me clear\nmy debt. That huge tip was a huge relief![VAR 0114(0006)]
I wanted to thank you properly for letting me clear\nmy debt. That huge tip was a huge relief![VAR 0114(0005)]
Don’t forget, kid—you owe someone money, you\nowe ’em your very life.\c\nI had a feeling we needed to be on equal footing,\nthat’s all. I might not be so generous again.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Say, since we’re all here anyway...how about a\nbattle?[VAR 0114(0013)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]I’m down! You are too, right,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0006)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]I’m down! You are too, right,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Definitely!
Uh...
Oh, come on. Don’t keep Corbeau waiting![VAR 0114(0006)]
Aw, come on! You’re really gonna make Corbeau\nwait?[VAR 0114(0005)]
All right! We’re Team MZ’s leader and secret\nweapon. We got this![VAR 0114(0006)]
All right! We’re Team MZ’s leader and secret\nweapon. We got this![VAR 0114(0005)]
[~ 17]
I aim to be a guy that my Scolipede can be proud\nof. I’ll prove myself in battle![VAR 0114(0013)]
This will be a chance for me to remind the boss\nthat he can depend on me.[VAR 0114(0014)]
Yeah, let’s battle!
I need a minute, please
Oh come on—let’s hurry up and battle.[VAR 0114(0013)]
I’ll send you home crying for sure this time![VAR 0114(0013)]
I’m as steadfast as steel, and equally patient. I\ncan wait as long as I need to.[VAR 0114(0014)]
The boss’s reputation is on the line, so don’t\nexpect me to hold back![VAR 0114(0014)]
We can’t leave Corbeau hanging. Let’s hurry up\nand battle![VAR 0114(0006)]
We can’t leave Corbeau hanging. Let’s hurry up\nand battle![VAR 0114(0005)]

Scolipede! As long as you’re with me, I can face\nany pinch with a smile![VAR 0114(0013)]
Mega Evolution proves our bond! Let me show\nyou the true beauty of Skarmory![VAR 0114(0014)]
I’m glad we get to battle together—it lets us break\nright through the limits we thought we had![VAR 0114(0006)]
I’m glad we get to battle together—it lets us break\nright through the limits we thought we had![VAR 0114(0005)]

You sure add an extra poison sting to your battles,\nCorbeau![VAR 0114(0005)]
Our teamwork still wasn’t enough to stand up to\nthe top two Trainers in the Z-A Royale.[VAR 0114(0013)]
I apologize, boss. This wouldn’t have happened if\nI were stronger...[VAR 0114(0014)]
You did well, Philippe. You always do. I’m always\ngrateful you’re around.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Why don’t we wrap this up? We get plenty of face\ntime in the real Lumiose anyway.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Here—take this outfit. But I’ve got something to\nask of you in return.[VAR 0114(0013)]
You received Corbeau’s Suit & Tie Set!
See, I think Team MZ and the Rust Syndicate have\ngotten a little too...buddy-buddy lately.[VAR 0114(0013)]
So I want you to remember just how ruthless and\ndangerous the Rust Syndicate is.\c\nWe’d happily send a beached Magikarp down to\nthe bottom of a river, or peel the skin clean off an\r\nEkans trying to molt![VAR 0114(0013)]
Point is, we got a reputation to uphold. So watch\nyourself and don’t forget who you’re dealing with![VAR 0114(0013)]
When all’s said and done, Lumiose will always be\nthe city that made me who I am.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Don’t you go dressing up as the boss and\nimitating him to scare people.[VAR 0114(0014)]
Aren’t Pokémon battles great?[VAR 0114(0006)]

How kind of you to come all this way to join us,\n[VAR 0100(0000)].\c\nAllow me to express my gratitude by challenging\nyou to a Pokémon battle![VAR 0114(0015)]
You came to talk to me instead of Lady Jacinthe,\nhuh? Guess you’ve got taste.\c\nAll right, it’s battle time![VAR 0114(0016)]
Hold up! Those numbers don’t look fair! I’m\ncoming to help, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(000C)]
You ready? Let’s dive right into battle![VAR 0114(000C)]
Let’s!
Wait!
Yeah, fair enough, this is all kind of a whirlwind!\c\nTalk to one of our SBC pals here once you’re\nfeeling ready![VAR 0114(000C)]
Let’s show these two SBC elites how great\nTeam MZ is![VAR 0114(000C)]
[~ 8]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Please do me the honor of a battle,\n[VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0015)]
You wanna battle me, yeah?[VAR 0114(0016)]
Let’s battle!
Wait a moment
How vexing of you to keep me waiting... I expect\nan affirmative answer soon![VAR 0114(0015)]
With Lebanne by my side, victory is assured![VAR 0114(0015)]
I was born to battle you, so quit stalling![VAR 0114(0016)]
Aw yeah! Just you watch—I’ll do way better than\nLady Jacinthe.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Talk to Jacinthe or Lebanne when you’re ready to\nshow the SBC who’s boss, OK?[VAR 0114(000C)]
[~ 18]
It is our responsibility as elites to guide the\nmasses, Clefable![VAR 0114(0015)]
Time for our secret weapon! Mega Evolve so we\ncan drag these kids, Dragalge![VAR 0114(0016)]
C’mon, Starmie! Let’s show ’em some of our best\nmoves![VAR 0114(000C)]
[~ 22]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Woooo! We won! We won,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(000C)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]I knew you were a talented battler,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]...\r\nBut\r\nLida,\r\nbrava!\c\nYou and your Starmie moved magnificently![VAR 0114(0015)]
If I may, Lady Jacinthe...[VAR 0114(0016)]
Dancers have great core strength and control over\ntheir bodies. It makes them suited to martial arts.\c\nWhen Trainers have that kind of strength and\ncontrol, it can help their Pokémon as well.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Does all this spark any interest in learning to\ndance, Lady Jacinthe?[VAR 0114(0016)]
You know very well that I have an abysmal sense\nof rhythm, Lebanne.[VAR 0114(0015)]
I could teach you![VAR 0114(000C)]
I... Thank you. Very much.[VAR 0114(0015)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]And [VAR 0100(0000)], please accept\nthis\r\nas\r\nproof\r\nof\r\nyour victory.[VAR 0114(0015)]
You received Jacinthe’s Dress!
Whoa, you get to do matching outfits with\nJacinthe?! Anything really is possible in\r\nHyperspace Lumiose![VAR 0114(000C)]
If the Jacinthe here in hyperspace is sensitive\nabout having no rhythm...does that mean the real\r\nJacinthe is, too?[VAR 0114(000C)]
I have worked diligently to avoid all means of\ndancing, even ballroom dancing...[VAR 0114(0015)]
I have something of a fondness for dance myself.\c\nIf Lady Jacinthe were amenable, I wouldn’t mind\nshowing her a thing or two...[VAR 0114(0016)]

What are we doing in a place like this?[VAR 0114(0017)]
This is that Hyperspace Lumiose thing, right?[VAR 0114(0018)]
I’m gathering our presence here is a reflection of\nsomeone’s subconscious thoughts.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Lucky me—I have some questions I’ve been\nwanting to ask you, Team Flare Nouveau!\c\nSo how about a battle? If I win, you tell me\neverything I want to know.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Lend me a hand here, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0008)]
Of course!
Hold on...
You want to scope out the situation before we\nstart battling? Smart move.[VAR 0114(0008)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]If [VAR 0100(0000)] and I join forces,\nwe’re\r\nsure\r\nto\r\nwin\r\nthis![VAR 0114(0008)]
[~ 9]
I admit that my resentment at not being chosen\nby Zygarde does still smolder a little, deep down.\c\nI’d be glad for the chance to battle you again, so\nI might sweep away the ashes of such regrets.[VAR 0114(0017)]
I’m not about to say no to a battle. Just know that\nif you lose, I’m putting you to work for me.[VAR 0114(0018)]
Well, I’m gonna win
Wait, not right now
My fire isn’t meant to smolder. It is meant to burn\nbright![VAR 0114(0017)]
Charizard! Let your dark flames pour forth![VAR 0114(0017)]
Then what are we even doing here?[VAR 0114(0018)]
Get ready to be burned to the ground![VAR 0114(0018)]
I want to know more about Team Flare from the\nold days—back when Dr. Xerosic was with them.[VAR 0114(0008)]
[~ 19]
We’re going to burn so bright, we’ll be blinding.\nLet’s ignite with Mega Evolution, Charizard![VAR 0114(0017)]
Nouveau is all about building a new life for\nourselves! Let’s Mega Evolve into something new![VAR 0114(0018)]
My Pokémon and I aren’t alone—my old mentors\nhave our backs in spirit![VAR 0114(0008)]
[~ 23]
We won. I take it you won’t object to answering a\ncouple questions now?[VAR 0114(0008)]
Naturally.[VAR 0114(0017)]
Tell me... Do you know why Dr. Xerosic was\nworking for Team Flare?[VAR 0114(0008)]
I know the doctor was working on a way to\nenhance humans’ abilities—not unlike how\r\nMega Evolution powers up Pokémon.\c\nThe result of his research was the Expansion Suit.[VAR 0114(0017)]
We were planned to be his very first test subjects.\nAt some point, however, those plans changed.\r\nI don’t know why, but you took our place.[VAR 0114(0017)]
I’ve got nothing to add. Never had much to do\nwith the guy.[VAR 0114(0018)]
The doctor was always kind to me... I wish I knew\nmore about who he was as a person.[VAR 0114(0008)]
I believe Xerosic valued his research above all\nelse...and yet he did show kindness to you.[VAR 0114(0017)]
People in general are walking self-contradictions.\nCan’t expect ’em to always make sense, right?[VAR 0114(0018)]
Remember him how you wish to
I don’t think his kindness was a lie
Thanks! That’s comforting to hear.[VAR 0114(0008)]
And here is a little thank-you gift from me.\c\nI feel more at peace now with Zygarde’s choice.\nYour actions make it clear why you were the one.[VAR 0114(0017)]
You received Grisham’s Chef Top Set!
If you ever come to lend a hand at Nouveau Café,\nmake sure you put that on and dress the part.[VAR 0114(0018)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]No, no. [VAR 0100(0000)] will be much\ntoo\r\nbusy\r\nfor\r\nthat.\c\n[VAR 1100(00FF,0201)]HShe has h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]iser own role to play in serving the people\nand Pokémon of our city.[VAR 0114(0017)]
I will not hold you to any obligation to come help\nat the café.\c\nDo, however, feel free to stop by anytime you like.\nWe are always around to offer our support.[VAR 0114(0017)]
It is remarkable, isn’t it? All around Lumiose City,\nboth people and Pokémon can find their own path\r\nand thrive in so many different ways.[VAR 0114(0017)]
This Hyperspace Lumiose thing is...pretty drab.\nWho subconsciously yearns for a place like this?[VAR 0114(0018)]
Working as a detective has allowed me to engage\nwith the city and its people in so many ways.\c\nIt’s such an interesting line of work![VAR 0114(0008)]

Join me, join me, join meee![VAR 0114(000F)]
Tasteless fakery.[VAR 0114(0012)]
The real Canari would never beg so shamelessly.[VAR 0114(0012)]
Should’ve known ya wouldn’t be fooled, Gwynn.[VAR 0114(0010)]
Still, ya gotta admit my hologram’s not a bad way\nto get the word out about my awesome grandkid![VAR 0114(0010)]
Canari doesn’t need more bandwagoners.[VAR 0114(0012)]
Canari deserves fans who adore her with their\nwhole heart—not people who fell for a hologram.[VAR 0114(0012)]
Now hold on![VAR 0114(0010)]
You sayin’ only folks who can afford to dedicate\neverything they’ve got to Canari count as fans?\c\nWhat about the people who just think she’s neat?\nThat sounds like a fan in my book![VAR 0114(0010)]
You think we should accept the bandwagoners?\nUgh...[VAR 0114(0012)]
POPS![VAR 0114(000F)]
You too, G-Volt. I get where you’re both comin’\nfrom, but quit arguing. I don’t like it.[VAR 0114(000F)]
I know—we oughta settle like Trainers: with a\nPokémon battle![VAR 0114(0010)]
Can I join?
I’m out, bye
No. Help me battle them.[VAR 0114(0012)]
I’m a true Canatic, and I’ll prove it.[VAR 0114(0012)]
[~ 18]
I don’t wanna let Pops just do whatever he wants,\nbut battling Gwynn sounds pretty fun...[VAR 0114(000F)]
I stand in for Canari enough to be practically the\nreal deal! So you sorta get to fight TWO Canaris!\r\nCount yer lucky stars, kid![VAR 0114(0010)]
Let’s battle!
Give me a minute
Come on, battle me! You really wanna throw this\nchance away? Psh...[VAR 0114(000F)]
I’ll battle you, but I’m not gonna let you win![VAR 0114(000F)]
Why’d you even come here, kid?[VAR 0114(0010)]
If we win, I’m gonna turn all yer little pals into\nCanatics![VAR 0114(0010)]
I’ll prove my love like only a true Canatic can.[VAR 0114(0012)]
[~ 28]
Enough playin’ around! Eelektross, let’s crank up\nthe voltage with Mega Evolution![VAR 0114(000F)]
Excadrill, I need ya to Mega Evolve! Let’s show\nthese kids what we’re made of![VAR 0114(0010)]
Chandelure... Mega Evolve and show them our\nlove...[VAR 0114(0012)]
[~ 32]
Canari, you know I’m the truest Canatic![VAR 0114(0012)]
Aw, G-Volt...[VAR 0114(000F)]
But...I understand that your charms deserve to be\nshared far and wide.[VAR 0114(0012)]
Just remember: My fans are important to me, but\nnot nearly as important as you, G-Volt![VAR 0114(000F)]
Yeah... ♥[VAR 0114(0012)]
But. We shouldn’t dupe people into being fans\nwith a holo-Canari.[VAR 0114(0012)]
Ya hear that, Pops?[VAR 0114(000F)]
Here. You both get somethin’ nice.[VAR 0114(000F)]
You received additional color options for\nCanari’s Tracksuit Set!
I hear some people are going to salons and stylin’\ntheir hair like me. If that’s your thing.[VAR 0114(000F)]
Th-that’s an option...?[VAR 0114(0012)]
Obviously G-Volt and I are super tight, but I hope\nyou and me can be tight too![VAR 0114(000F)]
I can’t believe me and the crew still couldn’t beat\nyou after all our training...[VAR 0114(000F)]
If we wanna get more fans, I think we need to do\nanother merch drop. Wonder what’d be good...[VAR 0114(0010)]
Oh, Canari...[VAR 0114(0012)]

Tell me—what do you seek strength for?[VAR 0114(0011)]
For me. Only me.[VAR 0114(0016)]
I pursue strength in order to protect Gwynn and\nothers I hold dear. A fine reason, no?[VAR 0114(0011)]
Hm. It’s true that I still haven’t beaten Jacinthe, so\nmy way might not be paying off yet.[VAR 0114(0016)]
But all this stuff I’m going through now is gonna\nmake me stronger in the end. I know it.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Once I defeat Jacinthe, I’m pretty sure I’ll never\nlose to anyone else ever again. So I’ll keep on\r\nfighting until that happens.[VAR 0114(0016)]
So you do indeed fight only for your own sake.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Does that attitude truly befit a Pokémon Trainer?![VAR 0114(0011)]
You. Come here.[VAR 0114(0012)]
I’m going to use you to settle their squabble.[VAR 0114(0012)]
Hey. [VAR 0100(0000)]’s here.\c\nNow we can all battle and settle who’s right\nalready.[VAR 0114(0012)]
I’m ready for battle!
Give me a minute
If you wanna get stronger, you better back up\nyour talk with action![VAR 0114(0016)]

I, too, desire battle![VAR 0114(0011)]
Let’s battle so I can go home.[VAR 0114(0012)]
I’m ready for battle!
Give me a minute
There are places in life you cannot reach without\nclimbing over strong opponents to get there.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Strength is power![VAR 0114(0011)]
I took you for someone more decisive.[VAR 0114(0012)]
Strength is justice![VAR 0114(0012)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Help me prove that my way is right,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]!\r\nLet’s\r\nbeat\r\nthe\r\nFist\r\nof Justice![VAR 0114(0016)]

Time to Mega Evolve, Falinks! Justice WILL win\nthe day![VAR 0114(0011)]
Chandelure... Mega Evolve. Finish them.[VAR 0114(0012)]
Time for our secret weapon! Mega Evolve so we\ncan drag these two, Dragalge![VAR 0114(0016)]
[~ 29]
Perhaps there is nothing nobler or better about\nfighting for others versus for yourself.[VAR 0114(0011)]
I shouldn’t have made it into a matter of morals.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Yeah, maybe. But protecting others is a noble\ncause, and I can tell it brings you peace of mind![VAR 0114(0016)]
Your words and our battle have moved me. Please,\nlet me offer you the uniform of our dojo.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Sorry. I’m sworn to keep this uniform on until I\nwin my way free of Jacinthe.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Understood. Then once again, I shall donate the\noutfit to you, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0011)]
You received additional color options for\nIvor’s Gi Set!
I hear the true oddballs out there will even copy\nIvor’s hairstyle to go with the gi set.[VAR 0114(0012)]
The path to strength has no end. Let us battle\nagain if ever an opportunity arises![VAR 0114(0011)]
In a way, Lebanne might be better suited to our\ndojo than I am.[VAR 0114(0012)]

[VAR BD06(0000)][VAR 0100(0000)]. How fortunate to\nfind\r\nyou\r\nhere\r\nat\r\nthis\r\nparticular\r\nmoment.[VAR 0114(000E)]
I’m here for a business meeting with one of our\nregular associates. Stay and observe if you like.[VAR 0114(000E)]
Our apologies for the wait.[VAR 0114(0014)]
Since this meeting is already running somewhat\nbehind schedule, we’ll get right to the point.[VAR 0114(0014)]
We’ve had a look at our financials, and we must\nsay—it feels to us that Quasartico isn’t paying\r\ntheir fair share for our hyperspace survey work.[VAR 0114(0014)]
I see. However, this is the split we agreed upon at\nthe outset. And Quasartico Inc. has provided a fair\r\ndeal of material support as well as financial.[VAR 0114(000E)]
We have also paid for R&D of additional tools that\nhave aided this whole endeavor.[VAR 0114(000E)]
We do acknowledge and appreciate that support,\nof course.\c\nBut at the same time, the number of distortions\nwe had to investigate exceeded all estimates.\c\nThis undertaking has required far more manpower\nthan we budgeted for.[VAR 0114(0014)]
Hard work tires people out. And what better way\nto show appreciation than a little cash bonus?[VAR 0114(0013)]
Noted. However, any changes to the budget\nwould require buy-in from all our stakeholders.\r\nIt’s not something I can make happen right away.[VAR 0114(000E)]
Perfectly understandable for such a major\ncompany tasked with the city’s redevelopment.[VAR 0114(0014)]
Though we do wish to point out that our\ninvestigations were also critical to ensure that\r\nyou still HAD a city to redevelop.[VAR 0114(0014)]
Now, I understand we all want what’s best for\nLumiose City, but talking’s getting us nowhere.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Perhaps we should settle this little disagreement\nwith a Pokémon battle?[VAR 0114(0014)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]\nI have no objection.\c\nHowever, allow me to nominate my associate\n[VAR 0100(0000)]\r\nhere\r\nto\r\njoin\r\nme.[VAR 0114(000E)]
Let’s do this
Why me?!
Please accept. It wouldn’t be wise to make\nCorbeau wait. Displeasing partners isn’t good for\r\nbusiness.[VAR 0114(000E)]
I admit that my own pride is also a small factor.[VAR 0114(000E)]
[~ 19]
Looks like we’re just gonna have to get our due\nout of Vinnie through battle![VAR 0114(0013)]
I’ll be doing everything in my power to defeat you\nboth. The boss’s reputation is on the line.[VAR 0114(0014)]
Let’s do this!
Give me a sec
Oh come on—let’s hurry up and battle.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Kind words are nice and all, but they’re not what\nreally motivates people in the end![VAR 0114(0013)]
The Rust Syndicate has our pride. We won’t make\nour people work for nothing.[VAR 0114(0014)]
The boss’s reputation is on the line, so don’t\nexpect me to hold back![VAR 0114(0014)]
We should get this battle started as soon as\npossible and not keep Corbeau waiting.[VAR 0114(000E)]
[~ 29]
Scolipede! As long as you’re with me, I can face\nany pinch with a smile![VAR 0114(0013)]
Mega Evolution proves our bond. Let me show\nyou the true beauty of Skarmory![VAR 0114(0014)]
Drampa, our hearts are perfectly aligned! Let us\nshow them what Mega Evolution can really do![VAR 0114(000E)]
[~ 33]
That was a worthy battle. I doubt I could have won\nwithout [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(000E)]
But a loss is a loss. We’ll let the matter of costs\nlie for the moment.[VAR 0114(0013)]
I will do my part to help the syndicate’s finances\nby tightening my belt, so to speak, and reducing\r\npersonal costs.[VAR 0114(0014)]
And please rest assured that I will work with our\nstakeholders to iron out a new budget proposal.\c\nAfter all, we are counting on the Rust Syndicate\nto carry out these investigations for us.[VAR 0114(000E)]
Guess I’ll dip into my personal savings a bit to\nmake up for the shortfall on our side.[VAR 0114(0013)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]You deserve a special bonus as well,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0013)]
You received additional color options for\nCorbeau’s Suit & Tie Set!
I hear you can even get your hair done like mine\nat the salon these days. Go nuts, kid.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Vinnie, my friend, I hope we can both continue to\ndo our best to make Lumiose a fine city–the kind\r\ncrowds visit and spend money in.[VAR 0114(0013)]
I couldn’t agree more.\c\nThat is why we at Quasartico Inc. all hope to\nnurture our collaboration with the Rust Syndicate.[VAR 0114(000E)]
This city might’ve changed over time, but it’s still\nwhere I’ve chosen to live. I’ll always love it here.[VAR 0114(0013)]
We were just little punks, but this city still gave us\na place to call home. I’ll do anything to repay that.[VAR 0114(0014)]
Corbeau certainly has his own convictions—just\nas I have mine.[VAR 0114(000E)]

How can she be so strong with such a weird\nattitude? I just don’t get it.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Sure, she’s got the type advantage, but that\ndoesn’t explain why I can’t ever seem to win...[VAR 0114(0016)]
And what’s so “elite” about her, anyway? She’s\ntotally cheating with those Jacinthe zones...[VAR 0114(0016)]
Goodness, Lebanne![VAR 0114(0015)]
“Weird attitude”? “Cheating”? What could you\npossibly mean by that, hm?[VAR 0114(0015)]
Uh... What?! I-is that what you heard?[VAR 0114(0016)]
There must be something wrong with your Holo\nCaster, Lady Jacinthe![VAR 0114(0016)]
I was merely marveling over your “sheer\naptitude” and saying that your Jacinthe zones\r\nare totally “charming”![VAR 0114(0016)]
I see... My Holo Caster is to blame, you say.[VAR 0114(0015)]
How peculiar—I could have sworn that I heard\naccusations of a “weird attitude” and “cheating.”[VAR 0114(0015)]
I, err... I was just voicing some minor, pent-up\ngrievances, that’s all![VAR 0114(0016)]
Nothing that cannot be easily remedied by a\nrousing Pokémon battle, I assure you![VAR 0114(0016)]
I see. It seems you require further teaching.[VAR 0114(0015)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Now then, Lebanne. Let us battle—you and my\nhologram versus my dear\r\n[VAR 0100(0000)]\r\nand me.[VAR 0114(0015)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Is that agreeable to you,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0015)]
Let us begin!
Please wait!
You cannot delay such a splendid battle, having\nme as both ally and opponent! We must begin![VAR 0114(0015)]
Only an elite such as I could allow you to fight\nbeside and against me simultaneously![VAR 0114(0015)]
[~ 19]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Please battle against my hologram,\n[VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0015)]
If we have a battle, Lady Jacinthe might forget all\nabout this![VAR 0114(0016)]
Let’s battle!
Wait a moment
How vexing of you to keep me waiting... I expect\nan affirmative answer soon![VAR 0114(0015)]
With Lebanne by my side, victory is assured![VAR 0114(0015)]
If you wanna help me, battle me! Come on![VAR 0114(0016)]
Aw yeah! Maybe a concentrated attack on Lady\nJacinthe will make it so this never happened...[VAR 0114(0016)]
I could take on the whole world as long as I have\nyou on my team![VAR 0114(0015)]
[~ 29]
It is our responsibility as elites to guide the\nmasses, Clefable![VAR 0114(0015)]
Time for our secret weapon! Mega Evolve so we\ncan drag these two, Dragalge![VAR 0114(0016)]
Not even I quite understand how my hologram is\nable to use Mega Evolution![VAR 0114(0015)]
[~ 33]
As expected, victory is mine![VAR 0114(0015)]
Now then, Lebanne. I assume your discontent\nstems from dissatisfaction with your current\r\ncircumstances, yes?[VAR 0114(0015)]
Yet for the life of me, I cannot fathom why being\naround me would cause you such unhappiness.[VAR 0114(0015)]
It’s myself I’m unhappy with, Lady Jacinthe. I’m\nfrustrated that I can never defeat you...[VAR 0114(0016)]
and that frustration came out in a...strange way. I\nmust be more diligent.[VAR 0114(0016)]
If that is how you feel, then I suppose we shall\nhave to train twice as hard as before![VAR 0114(0015)]
From now on, you can train by battling against me\nand my hologram—and grow twice as strong![VAR 0114(0015)]
[VAR BD06(0000)][VAR 0100(0000)], please accept this as\na\r\ntoken\r\nof\r\nmy\r\nthanks\r\nfor\r\nyour\r\nhelp today.[VAR 0114(0015)]
You received additional color options for\nJacinthe’s Dress!
I recommend adopting my hairstyle to complete\nthis ensemble.[VAR 0114(0015)]
Facing off against my hologram has helped me\ntruly appreciate just how magnificent I am.[VAR 0114(0015)]
Despite being a hologram, I am still me—the one,\nthe only, the magnificent![VAR 0114(0015)]
I need to work harder at keeping my grievances to\nmyself... Otherwise, things could get ugly.[VAR 0114(0016)]

I must say, Philippe—I keep hearing your name\nwhenever I speak to Lumiose’s great chefs.\c\nI begin to wonder if there’s more to you than\nmeets the eye.[VAR 0114(0017)]
I’m just your average thug who grew up here in\nLumiose City.[VAR 0114(0014)]
Though I did get to know this one chef, back in\nthe day.\c\nHe’d go on about how much effort folks like him\nput into their food, even though their hard work\r\ndisappeared the instant it was enjoyed.[VAR 0114(0014)]
That encounter inspired me to truly appreciate\nmeals with all my heart and soul. That’s all.[VAR 0114(0014)]
You seem pretty particular about such things\nyourself.\c\nYour croissants are always perfectly baked, and\nthat dash of salt you add is just right.[VAR 0114(0014)]
Cooking is a science. If you measure precisely and\nfollow the steps in order, you should never fail.[VAR 0114(0017)]
And I’ve trained my team to be able to adjust the\nheat of their fiery moves to a precise degree.[VAR 0114(0017)]
Now that’s something! That kind of workmanship\nexplains why you’re such a fine Trainer as well![VAR 0114(0014)]
It’s certainly true that regulating one’s power is\nan important factor in battles.[VAR 0114(0017)]
Honestly... Who’s got the energy to obsess about\nfood this much?[VAR 0114(0018)]
Anything tastes delicious if you work up an\nappetite after a long day of work.[VAR 0114(0018)]
Griselle!\c\nI’d love the chance to battle Philippe here. Won’t\nyou join me?[VAR 0114(0017)]
I might as well. Like I said—hunger is the best\nspice, and battling does work up an appetite.[VAR 0114(0018)]
Why don’t you battle alongside me?[VAR 0114(0014)]
I’d be happy to!
Hold on a sec...
We won’t hold you too long. Come join us on the\nbattle court.[VAR 0114(0014)]
Good. Let’s make this a battle that’ll really leave a\nmark.[VAR 0114(0014)]
[~ 18]
Thank you for joining us. I’d love to give Philippe\nhere a worthy battle to let him know how much\r\nI appreciate his passion for fine cooking.[VAR 0114(0017)]
C’mon. Let’s just do this already, OK? Grisham\nseems set on the whole battle thing.[VAR 0114(0018)]
Well, we’re gonna win!
I still need to prepare...
Please do. I won’t be satisfied with some weak\nsmolder. You must be properly fired up![VAR 0114(0017)]
Charizard! Let your dark flames pour forth![VAR 0114(0017)]
Then what are we even doing here?[VAR 0114(0018)]
Get ready to be burned to the ground![VAR 0114(0018)]
I appreciate you joining me for this battle.[VAR 0114(0014)]
[~ 28]
We’re going to burn so bright, we’ll be blinding.\nLet’s ignite with Mega Evolution, Charizard![VAR 0114(0017)]
Nouveau is all about building a new life for\nourselves! Let’s Mega Evolve into something new![VAR 0114(0018)]
Let’s go, Skarmory. Help me fight like a man.[VAR 0114(0014)]
[~ 32]
We may have lost, but I’m glad I had the chance\nto fight such a fiery Philippe.[VAR 0114(0017)]
I feel as if my passion for cooking has been\nignited anew.[VAR 0114(0017)]
Sure, whatever. Look, here’s a little something for\nyou for joining in the fun.[VAR 0114(0018)]
You received additional color options for\nGrisham’s Chef Top Set!
You might want to pair that look with Grisham’s\nsignature hairstyle as well. That’d be something.[VAR 0114(0018)]
Meeting the right people in your life can really set\nyou on the correct path, can’t it?[VAR 0114(0017)]
I want to elevate both my cooking and my battle\nskills to be the best they can be.[VAR 0114(0017)]
I’m so hungry after that battle—I bet even\ncardboard would taste good now.[VAR 0114(0018)]
Food is life. Both should be enjoyed to the fullest.[VAR 0114(0014)]

Hello, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0011)]
[VAR BD06(0000)][VAR 0100(0000)]? So you’re\nIvor-sensei’s\r\nrival![VAR 0114(01C8)]
We’ve heard a great deal about you.[VAR 0114(01C9)]
I am Lence—a devotee of the Pokémon known as\nThroh. Pleased to meet you.[VAR 0114(01C9)]
Hmph! Sneaking in with your own introduction\nwhen I was speaking to h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]imer first, are you?\c\nJust the sort of underhanded move I’d expect\nfrom a Throh fan![VAR 0114(01C8)]
I am Freppe, eternal follower of the Pokémon\ncalled Sawk![VAR 0114(01C8)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]You’ve caught us at an interesting moment,\n[VAR 0100(0000)].\r\nLet\r\nme\r\nexplain.[VAR 0114(0011)]
These two are fervent fans of Sawk and Throh,\nrespectively.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Each believes their Pokémon is stronger, and they\nwish to settle the matter with a team competition.[VAR 0114(0011)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]\nI have a team of four Throh, but I need a fifth.\c\nWould you round out our ranks with your own\nThroh, [VAR 0100(0000)]?\r\nYou\r\ncould\r\neven\r\nbe\r\ncaptain\r\nfor\r\nthe\r\nfinal match![VAR 0114(01C9)]
There you go again, stealing my thunder! Typical\nsneaky Throh fan![VAR 0114(01C8)]
I’ve been looking for a fifth Sawk, too![VAR 0114(01C8)]
Please, both of you—calm down.[VAR 0114(0011)]
How about it, [VAR 0100(0000)]?\c\nDo you feel moved to support one of these two?[VAR 0114(0011)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Please lend your might to the Sawk Squad,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(01C8)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Give your support to the Throh Throng,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(01C9)]
[~ 16]
To pick a team, come and talk to me with only a\nsingle Sawk or a single Throh in your party.[VAR 0114(0011)]
I see you’ve brought a Sawk. Does that mean\nyou’ll join the Sawk Squad?[VAR 0114(0011)]
I see you’ve brought a Throh. Does that mean\nyou’ll join the Throh Throng?[VAR 0114(0011)]
Yes, put me in!
Hang on...
Indeed! Think carefully about which side to join.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Congratulations on growing the ranks of the\nSawk Squad, Freppe.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Our victory is certain![VAR 0114(01C8)]
Congratulations on growing the ranks of the\nThroh Throng, Lence.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Thank you for choosing the Throh Throng! I’m\ndeeply honored to have you![VAR 0114(01C9)]
Now then, it’s time for our competition to\ncommence.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Allow me the honor of serving as witness and\nreferee![VAR 0114(0011)]
Let’s make sure we all know the rules.\c\nWe’ll have five matches, with the team captains\nsteering the final one. The team with more wins\r\noverall will be the victors of this competition.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Now begin![VAR 0114(0011)]

Ippon![VAR 0114(0011)]
Sawk of the Brutal Strike claims the match! We’re\ntied at two wins each.[VAR 0114(0011)]
It is time we settle this. Team captains, take your\nplaces with your Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0011)]
This is it—our final match. Sawk the Last-Minute\nEntrant versus Throh the Red Demon.[VAR 0114(0011)]

You did it! Together, we’ve proven Sawk’s glory![VAR 0114(01C8)]
You fought admirably.[VAR 0114(01C9)]

You did it! This is a victory for all Throh![VAR 0114(01C9)]
You fought admirably. Throh’s throws are, as\nalways, masterful.[VAR 0114(01C8)]

A life without a true rival isn’t worth living![VAR 0114(01CA)]
You got that right!
You feeling OK?
I knew you’d understand![VAR 0114(01CA)]
Of course not![VAR 0114(01CA)]
That’s why I need you to become my rival![VAR 0114(01CA)]
I know, I know—it’s a lot to ask from a stranger.\nBut just hear me out![VAR 0114(01CA)]
You and I were born on the same day. As children,\nwe chose to raise the same Pokémon: Charcadet.[VAR 0114(01CA)]
But depending upon the item its Trainer uses, this\nPokémon can evolve into two different species![VAR 0114(01CA)]
And we could not let our Charcadet remain\nCharcadet always...\c\nNo, fated rivals such as you and I cannot walk the\nsame path forever.[VAR 0114(01CA)]
So we parted ways, one of us choosing to evolve\nCharcadet into Armarouge—the other, Ceruledge![VAR 0114(01CA)]
That was that...until destiny called, and our paths\ncrossed again.[VAR 0114(01CA)]
On that fateful day, we decided to pit Ceruledge\nagainst Armarouge—a battle to determine once\r\nand for all which of us is the greater Trainer![VAR 0114(01CA)]
...Wouldn’t that just be the best story? I’ve always\nwanted a life like that, but I don’t have a rival born\r\non the same day as me—or even a friend.\c\nThat’s why I need you to become my rival. Please![VAR 0114(01CA)]
I’ve already got the Auspicious Armor and the\nMalicious Armor we need to evolve Charcadet![VAR 0114(01CA)]
I’ll give you whichever one you want, so please\nevolve a Charcadet and help me finally live out\r\nthe fateful battle of my dreams![VAR 0114(01CA)]
Just let me know whenever you’ve decided which\nset of armor you want![VAR 0114(01CA)]
[~ 17]
You’ve decided, right? You’ve chosen a set of\narmor?![VAR 0114(01CA)]
I’ll take the Auspicious Armor
I’ll take the Malicious Armor
I’m still not sure...
Ponder over the decision for as long as you’d like!\nThe fateful battle of my dreams is worth any wait![VAR 0114(01CA)]
The Auspicious Armor... So, you’re going to evolve\nyour Charcadet into Armarouge![VAR 0114(01CA)]
Then I’ll use the Malicious Armor to evolve my\nCharcadet here into Ceruledge![VAR 0114(01CA)]
Here we go, Charcadet! The day has come for you\nto wield the power of bitter blue flames![VAR 0114(01CA)]
Now we must fight to the finish—you with only\nyour Armarouge, I with only my Ceruledge![VAR 0114(01CA)]
Ruuue!
The Malicious Armor... So, you’re going to evolve\nyour Charcadet into Ceruledge![VAR 0114(01CA)]
Then I’ll use the Auspicious Armor to evolve my\nCharcadet here into Armarouge![VAR 0114(01CA)]
Here we go, Charcadet! The day has come for you\nto wield that blazing crimson power![VAR 0114(01CA)]
Now we must fight to the finish—you with only\nyour Ceruledge, I with only my Armarouge![VAR 0114(01CA)]
Armaaa!
[~ 33]
Shall we engage in our fated fight to the finish—\nCeruledge versus Armarouge?[VAR 0114(01CA)]
Let’s do it!
Hold on...
No, no! It has to be Armarouge versus Ceruledge!\nWho wants to see Ceruledge versus Ceruledge?![VAR 0114(01CA)]
Of course. You cannot rush fate. I will wait until\nyou are ready for this most important battle.[VAR 0114(01CA)]
At last I can experience the fateful battle between\nCeruledge and Armarouge I always dreamed of!\c\nLet the story unfold. I’ve got it all thought out...[VAR 0114(01CA)]
I never imagined our paths would cross again...\nNot like this.
I see you’ve evolved your old Charcadet into\nArmarouge at last...
[VAR BD06(0000)][VAR 0100(0000)]... Do you remember\nour\r\nvery\r\nfirst\r\nbattle—Charcadet\r\nversus\r\nCharcadet?
I defeated you that time
You beat me back then
Huh. Is that how you remember it? Either way,\nI’m not the same Trainer I was back then.
That’s right. But let me guess—you think you’re\nstronger now than you were before?
This ends here—with one true, decisive battle.\nCeruledge and I will win, and that will be that.
Now, Ceruledge...unleash your bitter blue flames!
This has to be a one-on-one battle! Just your solo\nArmarouge against my lone Ceruledge![VAR 0114(01CA)]
[~ 50]
The blade of bitter blue flames has fallen...\c\nTo have defeated my Ceruledge...you truly are the\none Trainer worthy of being called my rival.[VAR 0114(01CA)]
The blade of bitter blue flames swings true. This\nvictory belongs to Ceruledge.[VAR 0114(01CA)]
...That was the best!\c\nI finally got to live the fateful battle of my dreams.\nIt almost felt like you were truly my rival![VAR 0114(01CA)]
I am your true rival
Perhaps it was fate
Man—that’s my rival for you! Always saying the\ncoolest things![VAR 0114(01CA)]
[~ 57]
Shall we engage in our fated fight to the finish—\nArmarouge versus Ceruledge?[VAR 0114(01CA)]
Let’s do it!

I defeated you that time
You beat me back then
D-did you really...? Well. I’m not the same Trainer\nI was back then.
That’s right... But I’m no fool. I know you must’ve\ngrown stronger since that time!
This will be the final battle that decides everything\nbetween you and me! Armarouge and I will win—\r\nonce and for all!
Now, Armarouge...unleash your blazing crimson\nflames!
This has to be a one-on-one battle! Just your solo\nCeruledge against my lone Armarouge![VAR 0114(01CA)]
[~ 74]
The blazing crimson flames flicker and fade...\c\nTo have defeated my Armarouge...you truly are the\none Trainer worthy of being called my rival.[VAR 0114(01CA)]
The blazing crimson flames burn away all else.\nThis victory belongs to Armarouge.[VAR 0114(01CA)]
...That was the best!\c\nI finally got to live the fateful battle of my dreams.\nIt honestly felt like we truly were rivals![VAR 0114(01CA)]
I am your true rival
Perhaps it was fate
Man—that’s my rival for you! Always saying the\ncoolest things![VAR 0114(01CA)]

They’re both categorized as Fish Pokémon, after\nall. I bet they’ll get along very well.\c\nThough I do think I heard something about not\nreleasing wild Pokémon into new environments...[VAR 0114(01CB)]
But who cares! Look at the pond here!\c\nThe Feebas and Magikarp are having a great time![VAR 0114(01CB)]
The Feebas and Magikarp sure are living their\nbest lives here, aren’t they?[VAR 0114(01CB)]

Hey, would you take a look at this Corvisquire?[VAR 0114(01CD)]
You see that raggedy silk scarf it’s carrying?\nSeems like it’s dear to Corvisquire...[VAR 0114(01CD)]
My best guess is that Corvisquire came here\nlooking for the owner of that scarf.[VAR 0114(01CD)]
But the only clue I’ve got to go on is this name\nembroidered on the scarf: [VAR FF00(0006)]Destin[VAR FF00(0000)].[VAR 0114(01CD)]
Ah-CAW!!!
See? It reacted just now when I said the name\n“Destin”! That’s gotta mean something.\c\nIf I could only find out more about this scarf...[VAR 0114(01CD)]
Do you know anybody who would be\nknowledgeable about clothes and things?[VAR 0114(01CD)]
I could ask Naveen
I could ask Lida
Hey, what’s up?\c\nA...scarf?\c\nSorry, I don’t think I’ll be much help. Naveen’s\nprobably better to ask about that kind of thing![VAR 0114(000C)]
Hello?\c\nYou have a question about a scarf?[VAR 0114(000B)]
I am fairly familiar with different materials and\nsewing methods, of course, but even I can’t just\r\nlook at a scarf and tell you who it belongs to.[VAR 0114(000B)]
I know! Perhaps you could try asking Asami?[VAR 0114(000B)]
While she can be rather a handful to deal with,\nAsami at Boutique Couture is a pro designer.\r\nShe’ll likely recognize something about this scarf.[VAR 0114(000B)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Don’t give up, [VAR 0100(0000)]. I’m sure\nyou’ll\r\nfind\r\nthe\r\nowner.[VAR 0114(000B)]
You’ve got the look of someone who has found a\nlead to pursue.\c\nPlease—help find the owner of this scarf for\nCorvisquire![VAR 0114(01CD)]
Please help find the owner of that scarf for\nCorvisquire![VAR 0114(01CD)]
Cah!
[~ 18]
The fashion designer Asami is at your service. Did\nyou need something?[VAR 0114(003A)]
I’ll bet you’re here for another stylish\nMega Evolution battle, aren’t you?[VAR 0114(003A)]
No, no—please look at this scarf
Please just look at this scarf
Just look at the scarf, lady!
Oh, you want my evaluation of this scarf because\nyou have such faith in my skills as a designer.[VAR 0114(003A)]
Well, this scarf is...[VAR 0114(003A)]
It’s quite filthy.\c\nBut I do recognize the material and design. These\nscarves are given out to new students at a\r\ncertain school in the city of Wyndon in Galar.\c\nI believe this is the design from three years ago.[VAR 0114(003A)]
But why do you have this?[VAR 0114(003A)]
This Corvisquire brought it here
We’re trying to locate its owner
Searching out the lost owner of a scarf with only\nan embroidered name to go on...\c\nWhat a stylish adventure! I love it![VAR 0114(003A)]
Have you inquired yet at Académie Étoile?\c\nIf the owner is now living in Lumiose, it’s possible\nthey came to study at that academy.[VAR 0114(003A)]
If that scarf’s owner is now living in Lumiose,\nthey may be studying at Académie Étoile.[VAR 0114(003A)]
[~ 33]
Ah-CAW!!!
What the heck?! What’s with this Corvisquire?![VAR 0114(01CC)]
Wait... Are you...ROOKIDEE?![VAR 0114(01CC)]
Cah!
No way! But—but we met in the Galar region! You\ncame all the way across the sea to find me?![VAR 0114(01CC)]
Cah!
But you were hurt back then...and you were so\nsmall...[VAR 0114(01CC)]
But you still came to find me here in Lumiose\nafter I moved?[VAR 0114(01CC)]
You’re the BEST, Corvisquire![VAR 0114(01CC)]
Cahhh!
Hey, Trainer! You helped Corvisquire find its way\nhere to me, right? Thanks a million![VAR 0114(01CC)]
Do you think Corvisquire would like to be my\npartner and battle with me and all?[VAR 0114(01CC)]
Why wouldn’t it?
I bet it’d love that
Hey, d’you think I could ask you one more favor,\nwhile you’re here and all?\c\nI want a battle together with Corvisquire![VAR 0114(01CC)]
Just tell me as soon as you’re ready! I can’t wait![VAR 0114(01CC)]
Cah!
[~ 51]
Will you battle Corvisquire and me?[VAR 0114(01CC)]
Of course I will!
Give me a minute
Yeesh. Hurry it up, would you? I can’t wait to see\nhow strong Corvisquire has gotten![VAR 0114(01CC)]
OK, partner! Let’s test the strength you gained\ncrossing an ocean...against this Trainer![VAR 0114(01CC)]
[~ 57]
Corvisquire, we may have lost, but you were the\nBEST! Seriously!\c\nI’m gonna work hard from now on to be the best\nTrainer for you, too![VAR 0114(01CC)]
No way! Corvisquire, you’re seriously too strong!\c\nI’m gonna work hard from now on to be the best\nTrainer for you, too![VAR 0114(01CC)]
Cah!
And you, Trainer [VAR 1100(00FF,0302)]gulady! I’m never gonna forget\ntoday—it’s the best day of my life![VAR 0114(01CC)]
Thank you so, SO much![VAR 0114(01CC)]
Corvisquire... We’re never gonna be apart again![VAR 0114(01CC)]
Cah!

[VAR BD06(0000)]Wait, I know you! You’re\n[VAR 0100(0000)],\r\nright?\c\nWhat do you want? Why are you talking to me?![VAR 0114(01CF)]
Got a request for me?
Do you need any help?
Wh-what? Ah, sorry... You’re right, I do have\nsomething you could help with...[VAR 0114(01CF)]
Here’s my request... I want you to find some\nfriends for Frigibax.[VAR 0114(01CF)]
Bax...
*sigh*\c\nI got this Frigibax from my sister who studied\nabroad in Paldea, but it’s just so shy...[VAR 0114(01CF)]
I wish I could help it be more outgoing, but I’m\nnot exactly a social Butterfree myself...[VAR 0114(01CF)]
In other words, I’d...I’d like you to talk to the other\nTrainers here in Wild Zone 10 for me.[VAR 0114(01CF)]
Could...could you talk to the other Trainers in Wild\nZone 10 and help Frigibax make some friends?[VAR 0114(01CF)]
[~ 11]
What is it?[VAR 0114(01D0)]
You want Bergmite and Frigibax to be friends?[VAR 0114(01D0)]
Shiiink!
I hear that Bergmite and Frigibax don’t really get\nalong in Paldea...[VAR 0114(01D0)]
Bax! ♪
But it looks like this Frigibax and Bergmite are\ngetting along fine![VAR 0114(01D0)]
Bergmite and Frigibax are both Ice types, so their\nfriendship just might work out![VAR 0114(01D0)]
Time to talk to some more Trainers!
That’s all the Trainers in Wild Zone 10. Time to\nreturn to the requester!
[~ 21]
What’s up?[VAR 0114(01D1)]
I see! So you want Frigibax and Torchic to be\nfriends![VAR 0114(01D1)]
Torrr...
We love being outdoors. Torchic starting fires for\nus is always a big help.[VAR 0114(01D1)]
You got any useful tricks like that, Frigibax?[VAR 0114(01D1)]
Bax!
Well, you’re sure eager enough!\c\nI bet Frigibax could keep our drinks cool on our\noutdoor adventures. Sounds like fun![VAR 0114(01D1)]
Time to talk to some more Trainers!
That’s all the Trainers in Wild Zone 10. Time to\nreturn to the requester!

Huh? You talkin’ to me?[VAR 0114(01D2)]
Shaaa!
Whoa! You’re lookin’ for friends for your brave\nFrigibax here, huh?[VAR 0114(01D2)]
Funny how that works! My Zangoose could use a\nPokémon buddy too.[VAR 0114(01D2)]
Bax!
If you’re cool with it, I’d love if Frigibax and\nZangoose could be friends.[VAR 0114(01D2)]
Time to talk to some more Trainers!
That’s all the Trainers in Wild Zone 10. Time to\nreturn to the requester!
[~ 40]
So, what...what were the Trainers like?[VAR 0114(01CF)]
They sound...interesting...but I dunno.[VAR 0114(01CF)]
My sister studying abroad in Paldea told me\nBergmite fight with Frigibax...[VAR 0114(01CF)]
And the outdoors? Starting fires? That sounds so\ndangerous![VAR 0114(01CF)]
Also, isn’t Zangoose that scary Pokémon that’s\nalways feuding with Seviper?[VAR 0114(01CF)]
Sorry, but I think I’m going to give up on looking\nfor friends for Frigibax...[VAR 0114(01CF)]
Thank you for talking to all those Trainers—\nsomething my introverted self could never do.[VAR 0114(01CF)]
BABAX!!!
Frigibax! What’s the matter? Why are you yelling?[VAR 0114(01CF)]
I don’t think it’s happy
Think of how Frigibax feels
But I...I mean, I’m just no good at socializing...[VAR 0114(01CF)]
You must be Frigibax’s Trainer! Want to play with\nBergmite?[VAR 0114(01D0)]
I’m so excited to go camping with Frigibax that I\ncame to invite it myself![VAR 0114(01D1)]
Well, whaddya know—my Zangoose is lookin’\nhappy too![VAR 0114(01D2)]
Shaaa!
Bax!
[VAR 0100(0000)]... Wh-what should I...?[VAR 0114(01CF)]
Frigibax seems happy!
Frigibax looks up for it!
I-I know...but being around people is... It’s just\ntoo much pressure... I can’t...[VAR 0114(01CF)]
Not a problem! In that case, how about we all just\nhang back and chat about Pokémon a little?[VAR 0114(01D0)]
Even if we don’t end up talking much, what\nmatters is that our Pokémon are happy, right?[VAR 0114(01D1)]
I’ll be braggin’ about Zangoose, so tell me some\ngood things about Frigibax![VAR 0114(01D2)]
Ah... All right. That sounds...OK.[VAR 0114(01CF)]
Bax!

I’m still a total introvert, but I’ll do my best...[VAR 0114(01CF)]

Hey there! I’ve got some fine Leeks for strong\nTrainers like you![VAR 0114(01D4)]
By the way, have you heard of a Pokémon called\nFarfetch’d?[VAR 0114(01D4)]
It’s always holding a plant stalk, which it\nsometimes wields as a weapon![VAR 0114(01D4)]
Speaking of which, there’s a troubling rumor\ngoing around involving Farfetch’d and Leeks...[VAR 0114(01D4)]
They say if you go to a certain spot at nighttime\naccompanied only by a single Farfetch’d that’s\r\nholding a Leek...you’ll be suddenly ambushed![VAR 0114(01D4)]
Could you go fight off whoever’s behind this?\nShould be no sweat for a strong Trainer like you!\r\nI’ll even give you a good, sturdy Leek for the job.[VAR 0114(01D4)]
Go down the alley in [VAR FF00(0006)]Rouge Sector 7[VAR FF00(0000)] at [VAR FF00(0006)]night[VAR FF00(0000)] with\nonly a [VAR FF00(0006)]Leek[VAR FF00(0000)]-wielding [VAR FF00(0006)]Farfetch’d[VAR FF00(0000)] on your team...\r\nthen fight off anyone who tries to attack you![VAR 0114(01D4)]

You remember what the requester told you...\c\n“Go down the alley in [VAR FF00(0006)]Rouge Sector 7[VAR FF00(0000)] at [VAR FF00(0006)]night [VAR FF00(0000)]with\nonly a [VAR FF00(0006)]Leek[VAR FF00(0000)]-wielding [VAR FF00(0006)]Farfetch’d[VAR FF00(0000)] on your team...\r\nthen fight off anyone who tries to attack you!”
What a fine-looking Leek you have... I challenge\nyou to a duel of Farfetch’d and fate![VAR 0114(01D5)]
W-wait, why’s that stalk so huge?! Is that a\nGalarian Farfetch’d? N-no matter![VAR 0114(01D5)]
Kuwah!
Guwah!
Have at you![VAR 0114(01D5)]
Now, back to business...[VAR 0114(01D4)]
[~ 15]
I underestimated you—forgive my disrespect![VAR 0114(01D5)]
Masterful stalk-wielding technique... Unflinching\nresolve against an oniony onslaught...\c\nYou must certainly be a Trainer of great renown.[VAR 0114(01D5)]
To best him with such aplomb... A skillful display.[VAR 0114(01D3)]
Now it’s my turn—I challenge you to the fight of\nour chives![VAR 0114(01D3)]
My comrade’s defeat is my defeat... I must avenge\nthis dishonor![VAR 0114(01D3)]
Wait, wait, wait—GALARIAN Farfetch’d?! Guh...\nRegardless! I shall fight with allium my strength![VAR 0114(01D3)]
Kuuuwah!
Guwah!
Have at you![VAR 0114(01D3)]
[~ 25]
I concede![VAR 0114(01D3)]
Such strength is surely one in a scallion... How\nrelentlessly must one train to reach that level...?[VAR 0114(01D3)]
So, both my comrades have been bested...[VAR 0114(01D4)]
I mustn’t let Les Trois Poireaux fall into disgrace.[VAR 0114(01D4)]
I am Bouché, leader of the three Leek wielders...\nand the mightiest member of our gallant trio.[VAR 0114(01D4)]
I shall now demonstrate the power of the Kanto\nStalk Style.[VAR 0114(01D4)]
You think your Galarian Farfetch’d can stop me?\nTime for a taste of the Kanto Stalk Style![VAR 0114(01D4)]
Prepare yourself![VAR 0114(01D4)]
GUWAAAH!
Kuwah!!!

Kuwah! Kuuuwah... Guuuwah!
Heh heh heh...[VAR 0114(01D4)]
Phew! Now those were some duels of derring-do![VAR 0114(01D4)]
Sorry about all that. To tell you the truth, we’re\nreal big fans of the movie Les Trois Poireaux.[VAR 0114(01D4)]
We’ve long dreamed of acting out a scene from\nthe movie...with Pokémon battles just like those.[VAR 0114(01D5)]
But to make that happen, we needed a Farfetch’d\nand Trainer strong enough to stand up to our trio.[VAR 0114(01D3)]
That’s when you came into the picture. I sent you\ndown this alley, and the rest is history![VAR 0114(01D4)]
I didn’t tell you the whole story from the start\nbecause I wanted to build up a little suspense...[VAR 0114(01D4)]
I’m sorry for tricking you—hope we didn’t ruffle\nyour feathers too badly.[VAR 0114(01D4)]
But thank you for making our dream come true![VAR 0114(01D4)]
I got to quote all my favorite lines... I’ll relish this\nmoment till the end of my days![VAR 0114(01D5)]
Our Farfetch’d played their parts gallantly too![VAR 0114(01D3)]
Kuwah! Kuwahhh... Guuuwah!

These Pokémon seem to be sleeping...
Ohhh no. I’ve heard about these things in ghost\nstories... They’re Cofagrigus![VAR 0114(001D)]
Apparently they trap people inside their bodies...[VAR 0114(001D)]
Y-you gotta attack ’em! We gotta drive ’em off\nand find whoever was screaming![VAR 0114(001D)]

I let out a big whoop of excitement, and I think\nthe noise ticked Cofagrigus off.[VAR 0114(01D6)]
So it got mad and swallowed me up.[VAR 0114(01D6)]
Thing is, it was just so darn comfy in there, I\ndozed off. I think I was about to hit REM mode.[VAR 0114(01D6)]

Were we speaking?
I’m sorry, what?
A Wigglytuff’s fur feels sublime—just one touch\nand you’ll never want to take your hand away.[VAR 0114(01D7)]
But not mine. This one’s fur is gross and stiff and\nSO, SO STINKY![VAR 0114(01D7)]
The problem is that my Wigglytuff hates showers\nlike nobody’s business.[VAR 0114(01D7)]
So I’ve come up with a little plan.\c\nI just need to get into a “battle” against someone\nwho can wash it clean with a Bubble Beam![VAR 0114(01D7)]
Please, put a Pokémon that knows Bubble Beam\non your team and let me know when you’re ready![VAR 0114(01D7)]

TUUUFFFFFF!!![VAR 0114(01D7)]
Wigglytuff used a fearsome slap!
W-Wigglytuff, whyyy?![VAR 0114(01D7)]
Was my Wigglytuff letting its fur get gross on\npurpose...to keep me from clinging so much?[VAR 0114(01D7)]
Waaaiiit! Wigglytuff, wait for meee![VAR 0114(01D7)]

Hey, kid![VAR 0114(002B)]
You got a second?[VAR 0114(002B)]
Hope you’ve been all right. Sorry again for that\nbusiness with the Goomy on the bench.[VAR 0114(002B)]
That’s all—I just saw you and thought I should\napologize. I don’t have any questions for you.[VAR 0114(002B)]
Especially not right now. My hands are full with\nthis Lumiose Museum robbery case.[VAR 0114(002B)]
Sounds serious!
Need a hand?
Oh, sorry. It’s not a REAL robbery—it’s a training\nscenario. All of us on the force have to do ’em.[VAR 0114(002B)]
We’re role-playing what we’d do to stop a robbery\nat the Lumiose Museum if one actually happened.[VAR 0114(002B)]
Though come to think of it...[VAR 0114(002B)]
I know you’ve got skills—I’ve seen ’em in action.\nMaybe you could give me a hand![VAR 0114(002B)]
You could play the robber and pretend to break\ninto the museum for me![VAR 0114(002B)]
Let me know when you’re ready to play a little\nmake-believe—or in this case, make-be-thieve![VAR 0114(002B)]
[~ 13]
Ready to play make-believe? Or should I call it...\nmake-be-thieve?[VAR 0114(002B)]
I’m ready!
Not yet
Copy that. If this training’s going to serve its\npurpose, you’ve got to be ready to give it your all.[VAR 0114(002B)]
Then let’s get this training started![VAR 0114(002B)]
Your first task is to “storm” the museum. Just\nwalk on in through the front door.\c\nOnce you’re in, you’ll “steal” an outfit from the\nancient Sinnoh exhibit on the second floor.\c\nAs you go, officers will try to stop you. When they\nchallenge you to battle, take ’em on.[VAR 0114(002B)]
Just watch out—the officers you’ll be up against\nare some of Lumiose City’s finest.[VAR 0114(002B)]
When you’re ready to go, you can leap down from\nthis roof to start the training scenario![VAR 0114(002B)]
[~ 22]
Did you forget the plan? “Storm” the museum\nthrough the front door.[VAR 0114(002B)]
[~ 24]
Stop right there—or face me in a Pokémon battle!\c\nThat’s my line, right?[VAR 0114(01CD)]
[~ 26]
Oops. I’m glad our officers are performing well,\nbut that’s not how the scenario goes. Try again![VAR 0114(002B)]
[~ 28]
This is Première! A robber has breached the front\ndoor and is storming the museum!\c\nAaand...scene![VAR 0114(01CD)]
[~ 30]
Oh no! A thief! We’re being robbed![VAR 0114(0023)]
[VAR 1100(00FF,0201)]HShe must be after the ancient Sinnohan ritual\noutfit on the second floor![VAR 0114(0023)]
Help! Help!\nWe’re being robbed! [VAR BD0A(000A)]Text_icon1
Not the ancient Sinnohan\ngarb on the second floor! [VAR BD0A(000A)]Text_icon1
[~ 35]
Halt, lawbreaker! You may have gotten past the\nguard at the front door, but your spree ends here![VAR 0114(01CD)]
[~ 37]
The “intruder” has broken through another line of\ndefense! [VAR 1100(00FF,0201)]HShe’s past the reception counter![VAR 0114(01CD)]
This is supposed to be pretend, so I sure hope the\nchief doesn’t ask for my badge for real...[VAR 0114(01CD)]
[~ 40]
That’s far enough.[VAR 0114(01CD)]
Forget the training! I challenge you to a REAL\nbattle![VAR 0114(01CD)]
[~ 43]
You “stole” the ancient Sinnohan outfit!
[VAR BD06(0000)]The notorious [VAR 0100(0000)] is\nescaping\r\nwith\r\nthe\r\npriceless\r\nancient\r\nSinnohan\r\noutfit!\c\nSet up a perimeter! We can’t let this master\ncriminal make it out of Lumiose and evade justice![VAR 0114(01CD)]
[~ 46]
This was great practice, but writing a report on\nhow we failed is going to be tough...[VAR 0114(01CD)]
I bet the higher-ups will make our training even\nharder next time.[VAR 0114(01CD)]
Officer Licier—permission to speak?\c\nWouldn’t this training have gone a lot smoother if\nyou hadn’t recruited such a strong Trainer?[VAR 0114(01CD)]
W-well, we’ve identified some areas for growth...\nand isn’t that what good training is all about?![VAR 0114(002B)]
Looks like our team’s got some work to do if we\nwant to protect the city properly.[VAR 0114(002B)]
With that, we’ll take our leave. Thanks for bearing\nwith me again, kid![VAR 0114(002B)]

Crabominable always aims to be the best and will\npunch whatever it sees to accomplish that.[VAR 0114(01D9)]

Who, exactly, is “Rosebud”?
What kind of Pokémon is that?
There’s no mistaking Rosebud—one look and\nyou’ll know right away![VAR 0114(01DA)]

Hello, I’m a tip board![VAR 0114(01DC)]
Or I might as well be. My name is Avise, and I’m\nhere to keep people informed![VAR 0114(01DC)]
All I care about is thinking up helpful new Trainer\nTips that delight the folks of Lumiose.[VAR 0114(01DC)]
But you can’t put up Trainer Tips if you don’t have\nnifty nuggets to share!\c\nAnd there’s still plenty in this world that I don’t\nknow![VAR 0114(01DC)]
You look like you’ve got plenty of experience. Can\nyou help me workshop some new tips?[VAR 0114(01DC)]
Let me know when you’re ready, and I’ll give your\nbrain a little picking![VAR 0114(01DC)]
[~ 6]
Question one![VAR 0114(01DC)]
Let’s see if you know this!\c\nIf you’re going into Hyperspace Lumiose to look\nfor Shiny Pokémon, what kind of Flavor Power\r\nshould you go for in your donut?[VAR 0114(01DC)]
Sparkling Power
Delightful Power
Awesome Power
Surprise Power
Hm. That’s not what I’ve heard.[VAR 0114(01DC)]
Good answer![VAR 0114(01DC)]
Though let me just duck away for a moment to\ncheck with my sources...[VAR 0114(01DC)]
OK, my sources have confirmed the answer!\c\nSparkling Power makes you more likely to run into\nShiny Pokémon. The more Sparkling Power, the\r\nbrighter your chances![VAR 0114(01DC)]
That’s a new tip I can share with Trainers. Thanks\nfor your help!\c\nI’ve got more to ask you, but let’s take a quick\nbreak for your brain to rest.[VAR 0114(01DC)]
Let me know when you’re ready for more grilling![VAR 0114(01DC)]
[~ 19]
Question two![VAR 0114(01DC)]
Let’s see if you know this!\c\nIf a Pokémon’s maxed out on hyperspace levels,\nabout what level could it reach overall?[VAR 0114(01DC)]
Lv. 150
Lv. 200
Lv. 500
Lv. 999
Hm. That’s not what I’ve heard.[VAR 0114(01DC)]
Good answer![VAR 0114(01DC)]
Though let me just duck away for a moment to\ncheck with my sources...[VAR 0114(01DC)]
OK, my sources have confirmed the answer!\c\nIf a Pokémon is fully maxed out on hyperspace\nlevels, it could reach up to Lv. 200!\c\nWhew. Guess you’d better optimize your donuts’\nFlavor Scores for a healthy Level Boost![VAR 0114(01DC)]
That’s two new tips I can share with Trainers.\nThanks for your help!\c\nI’ve got more to ask you, but let’s take a quick\nbreak for your brain to rest.[VAR 0114(01DC)]
Let me know when you’re ready for more grilling![VAR 0114(01DC)]
[~ 32]
Question three![VAR 0114(01DC)]
Let’s see if you know this!\c\nIf you finish all three hyperspace tasks in a pocket\nof Hyperspace Lumiose, what appears?[VAR 0114(01DC)]
A golden Pokémon
A golden Trainer
A golden Poké Ball
A golden Berry
Hm. That’s not what I’ve heard.[VAR 0114(01DC)]
Good answer![VAR 0114(01DC)]
Though let me just duck away for a moment to\ncheck with my sources...[VAR 0114(01DC)]
OK, my sources have confirmed the answer!\c\nIf you finish all three hyperspace tasks, a golden\nPoké Ball chockablock with nice items should\r\nappear somewhere in that pocket of hyperspace!\c\nThough that only goes for hyperspace wild zones\nand hyperspace battle zones, I’m told.[VAR 0114(01DC)]
That’s three new tips I can share with Trainers.\nThanks for your help![VAR 0114(01DC)]
One last question for you: Which of our three\ntopics would YOU like to see as a Trainer Tip?[VAR 0114(01DC)]
The first one—Sparkling Power
The second one—hyperspace levels
The third one—golden Poké Balls
Noted! A fine choice.[VAR 0114(01DC)]
The only problem is, you can’t just put up new\nsignboards willy-nilly here.[VAR 0114(01DC)]
You’ve got to apply for a permit at city hall, then\nhire a construction company—it’s a headache![VAR 0114(01DC)]
So how’ll you do it?
So will you give up?
I’ll do the only thing I can do...[VAR 0114(01DC)]
I’ll be the tip board![VAR 0114(01DC)]
Or I might as well be, anyway! I can inform the\npeople myself![VAR 0114(01DC)]
Just until construction gets started on the new\nofficial tip board, of course.\c\nThanks very much for your help! I’m thrilled to be\nof service to tip-seeking Trainers![VAR 0114(01DC)]

This...is Café Triste.[VAR 0114(01DE)]
As our name suggests, we cultivate a...subdued\natmosphere here.[VAR 0114(01DE)]
Once, years ago, we suddenly began to grow\nmuch more popular.\c\nOur café was bursting with customers. In the end,\nwe couldn’t serve them all.[VAR 0114(01DE)]
It got so busy I wanted to pull out my own hair.\nTo such overwhelming crowds, I say “non, merci!”[VAR 0114(01DE)]
And yet if no customers come at all, we can’t stay\nin business. It’s a delicate balance.[VAR 0114(01DE)]
You see what I’m driving at, yes?[VAR 0114(01DE)]
You’re driving at something?
I’m not a mind reader...
To attract enough customers to keep us afloat—\nyet not so many that we drown—we need to offer\r\ndishes that are just tempting enough![VAR 0114(01DE)]
What dish do you think would suit our menu?[VAR 0114(01DE)]
Lumiose Galettes?
Croissants?
Curry and rice?
Oh, you can get Lumiose Galettes anywhere!\nNon, merci![VAR 0114(01DE)]
We’d forever be in the shadow of Nouveau Café’s\ncroissanterie! Non, merci![VAR 0114(01DE)]
And hear people grouse that it’s not as tasty as\nHotel Z’s surprisingly good curry? Non, merci![VAR 0114(01DE)]
Perhaps sushi is the answer![VAR 0114(01DE)]
It’s pleasantly light, not too filling...but it would\nclash horribly with coffee! Perfect for attracting\r\nonly a modest crowd of true enthusiasts![VAR 0114(01DE)]
Quite the ingenious solution, if I do say so myself![VAR 0114(01DE)]
But I’ve never even attempted making sushi...[VAR 0114(01DE)]
And a research trip to Sushi High Roller would\nbreak my meal budget. Non, merci!\c\nThis time you see what I’m driving at, don’t you?[VAR 0114(01DE)]
No, I suppose you don’t...\c\nI’m asking you to show me Tatsugiri! I want to see\nthis Pokémon in all three of its fishy forms![VAR 0114(01DE)]
[~ 22]
Have you got a Tatsugiri to show me? If so,\nwhich form?[VAR 0114(01DE)]
Curly Form
Droopy Form
Stretchy Form
None right now
Excusez-moi! That is not the form you said! Did\nyou think I wouldn’t be able to tell? Non, merci![VAR 0114(01DE)]
You’re not the type of person who would renege\non a promise, are you? Non, merci![VAR 0114(01DE)]
[~ 30]
So this is a Curly Form Tatsugiri!\c\nSeems like it’d be hard to make food curl up like\nthat, but it’s helpful to see an example.[VAR 0114(01DE)]
This is helpful. I look forward to seeing all of\nTatsugiri’s forms.[VAR 0114(01DE)]
[~ 33]
So this is a Droopy Form Tatsugiri!\c\nIt’s funny how sushi can droop like that and still\nbe appealing![VAR 0114(01DE)]
This is helpful. I look forward to seeing all of\nTatsugiri’s forms.[VAR 0114(01DE)]
[~ 36]
So this is a Stretchy Form Tatsugiri!\c\nI think I can finagle something like this, as long\nas I’ve got something to balance on some rice...[VAR 0114(01DE)]
This is helpful. I look forward to seeing all of\nTatsugiri’s forms.[VAR 0114(01DE)]
[~ 39]
I appreciate you showing me all three forms of\nTatsugiri.[VAR 0114(01DE)]
I think I can take a passable stab at making sushi\nnow. Give me a moment...[VAR 0114(01DE)]
Well? What do you think?\c\nIt’s obviously not made by a pro, but it looks just\ngood enough to make you curious.[VAR 0114(01DE)]
Which means it should be a perfectly lukewarm\nseller for our modest-hit menu![VAR 0114(01DE)]
Hold up—is that for real?![VAR 0114(01DF)]
SUSHI...with COFFEE?[VAR 0114(01DF)]
Lumiose really is gourmet central. People will try\neating all kinds of things![VAR 0114(01DF)]
I may not be the one eating it, but the world\nneeds to see this![VAR 0114(01DF)]
Hey, Brenda’s Besties! I’m back with another one-\nhundred-percent authentic Lumiose food find![VAR 0114(01DF)]
This sushi-coffee combo is BLOWING my MIND\nand opening up a WHOLE NEW WORLD!\c\nCafé Triste is on a whole new level, so come get\non it! Byeee![VAR 0114(01DF)]
Whoops. There I go again—another impromptu\nlivestream. I just can’t stop changing the world![VAR 0114(01DF)]
This is it—that sushi-coffee combo spot!
Hey, lemme get a sushi-coffee combo!
One sushi-coffee combo— Sheesh, what a long\nname... Maybe you could call it Sooffee? Cofushi?
Too many customers! NON, MERCIII!!![VAR 0114(01DE)]

I’ve finally done it...[VAR 0114(01E0)]
They said it couldn’t be done, but I did it. For the\nsake of our customers, I really went and did it.[VAR 0114(01E0)]
You may know of the ultimate beans we use in\nour Ultimo Coffee, AKA the 100,000 brew.\c\nWell, I have obtained the ultimate grade of the\nultimate beans—the supreme cream of the crop.[VAR 0114(01E0)]
They can only be harvested in a select area. And\nonly a handful are produced at a time.[VAR 0114(01E0)]
But thanks to the power of Pokémon, I finally got\nthem: the ultimate beans of supreme ultimacy![VAR 0114(01E0)]
This is the achievement of a lifetime.[VAR 0114(01E0)]
Wouldn’t you like a taste of my once-in-a-lifetime\nbrew?[VAR 0114(01E0)]
I sure would
I think I’m good
Hrm. I suppose you do seem better suited to a\npedestrian cup of 100,000 brew.[VAR 0114(01E0)]
Then prepare to pay the price. It’ll cost you\n1,000,000.[VAR 0114(01E0)]
If you truly are interested—and you’re sure you\nwon’t regret it—then go on. Order a cup.[VAR 0114(01E0)]
[~ 12]
The ultimate beans of supreme ultimacy. This kind\nof chance only comes around once in a lifetime.\c\nHave you come to partake of my ultimate special?[VAR 0114(01E0)]
Yes
No
Hmph. I suppose you do seem better suited to a\npedestrian cup of 100,000 brew.[VAR 0114(01E0)]
Hmph. Can’t even scrape together 1,000,000?\c\nYou DO seem better suited to a pedestrian cup of\n100,000 brew.[VAR 0114(01E0)]
You’re absolutely sure?\c\nYou really believe you’re worthy of a cup of\n1,000,000 brew?\c\nYou think this is a good use of all your savings?\nAnd you’ll be able to appreciate this brew’s taste?[VAR 0114(01E0)]
Yes
No
You know that appreciating such a rare bean is\nabout more than merely tasting the difference.\c\nIt’s about understanding the bean itself.\c\nKnowing how it was grown. How it was roasted.\nWhen. Where. Why.\c\nAnd still you insist that you can appreciate a\n1,000,000 cup of coffee?[VAR 0114(01E0)]
I do
Nope
And can you express the unique notes of such a\nbean—describe its flavor in your own words?\c\nMerely saying that it tastes like a 1,000,000 cup\nof coffee won’t cut it. That relates nothing.\r\nNothing at all. Such words are dregs in my mug.\c\nYou’re sure you aren’t merely chasing after some\nshallow desire for notoriety?\c\nYou aren’t here just so you can boast—plebe that\nyou are—that you’ve tasted a 1,000,000 brew?[VAR 0114(01E0)]
I want to drink the coffee!
This can’t be worth it
So, you’ll fork over 1,000,000 of your hard-\nearned cash.\c\nThen you’ll spew out some ignorant commentary\nabout the flavor and simply embarrass yourself.\r\nThe shame will never leave you.\c\nYou realize what’s at stake, don’t you? And yet\nyou claim to be ready for the ultimate special—\r\nthe ultimate coffee of supreme ultimacy?[VAR 0114(01E0)]
I want the blasted coffee!
Nothing can be worth this
Then allow me to confirm just one last time...\c\nYou wish to drink a cup of my ultimate special—a\nbrew so rare it can be had but once in a lifetime?\c\nYou seek the ultimate coffee of supreme ultimacy?[VAR 0114(01E0)]
Just sell me the dang coffee!
That’s it—I’m so done with you
Such determination... Now THAT is worthy of my\nonce-in-a-lifetime special. That is what deserves\r\na cup of the ultimate coffee of supreme ultimacy.[VAR 0114(01E0)]
I ask forgiveness for testing your resolve so\nrelentlessly.[VAR 0114(01E0)]
I will prepare your coffee at once. Please have a\nseat and relax.[VAR 0114(01E0)]
Go ahead, dear customer. Try my ultimate special:\nthe ultimate coffee of supreme ultimacy.[VAR 0114(01E0)]
All right...bottoms up!
Wait...let me take it in
That, dear customer, was a cup brewed from the\nultimate beans of supreme ultimacy.\c\nMy ultimate special—a once-in-a-lifetime delicacy.\nAnd how would you describe the flavor?[VAR 0114(01E0)]
An experience of joy that dims all others
The ultimate in aroma and aftertaste
Truly a once-in-a-millennium flavor
Pretty normal, I guess?
Yes. And discovering that for yourself is surely a\n1,000,000 experience.[VAR 0114(01E0)]
Thank you for your lovely words. They are most\nworthy of a 1,000,000 cup of coffee.[VAR 0114(01E0)]
And now, the matter of the bill. That will be\n1,000,000, if you please.[VAR 0114(01E0)]
I imagine the ultimate beans must be glad to have\nbeen consumed by the ultimate Trainer.[VAR 0114(01E0)]

We’re giving out free Protein as part of a special\npromotion![VAR 0114(01E1)]
Could I ask for just a moment of your time?[VAR 0114(01E1)]
Sure...
I’m busy
C’mon, we’ll be done before you can even say no![VAR 0114(01E1)]
Thank youuu![VAR 0114(01E1)]
All righty! Let’s get started with our Protein street\nsurvey![VAR 0114(01E1)]
Do you know what Protein is?[VAR 0114(01E1)]
I know all about it!
I do, more or less
I have no idea
I see! Well, Protein is a nutritious drink.[VAR 0114(01E1)]
Where did you find out about Protein?[VAR 0114(01E1)]
From social media
From a friend
From a poster
From a Pokémon Center
From you...
Noted! Where you get your information from is\nimportant, isn’t it?[VAR 0114(01E1)]
Does 5,000 for a bottle of Protein sound\nexpensive to you?[VAR 0114(01E1)]
That’s steep!
Not really
That’s cheap!
I see! Everyone has their own way of valuing\nthings.[VAR 0114(01E1)]
Do you know of any other drinks similar to\nProtein?[VAR 0114(01E1)]
I know about Iron
I’ve heard of Calcium
I’m familiar with Zinc
I’m aware of Carbos
I don’t know any others
Gotcha. There are so many different products that\nit can be hard to keep track, huh?[VAR 0114(01E1)]
When would you want to have your Pokémon\ndrink a bottle of Protein?[VAR 0114(01E1)]
When I want to raise its Attack
When I want to raise its Defense
When I want to raise its Sp. Atk
When I want to raise its Sp. Def
When I want to raise its Speed
Noted! Make sure to follow the usage\ninstructions![VAR 0114(01E1)]
What do you think Protein tastes like?[VAR 0114(01E1)]
Tasty...?
Sweet?
Bitter?
No idea
I see! Make sure to let your Pokémon know what\nyou think![VAR 0114(01E1)]
Would you recommend Protein to a friend?[VAR 0114(01E1)]
Yes, definitely!
Yeah, sure
Probably not
I don’t know
Got it. Whether or not you recommend something\nreally depends on who you’re talking to![VAR 0114(01E1)]
Aaand that’s all for our survey! Thank you for your\ntime![VAR 0114(01E1)]
I bet you’re wondering what this cute Cubone is\ndoing next to me![VAR 0114(01E1)]
Kew! Kew! ♪
As long as I’m with Cubone, everyone stops to\nchat, so it gets me plenty of takers for the survey![VAR 0114(01E1)]
Thank you for answering all of our questions!\nHere’s a small token of our appreciation.[VAR 0114(01E1)]
You received a bunch of items from Cubone!

Maybe my next survey will be about Iron![VAR 0114(01E1)]

I...I need your help...[VAR 0114(01E2)]
I have a date with a lady who likes Purrloin, but...[VAR 0114(01E2)]
Meow!
I’m so nervous, I don’t think I’ll be able to carry\non a conversation...so I’m asking for your help![VAR 0114(01E2)]
Could you please help me talk to her? Please?\nPLEASE?![VAR 0114(01E2)]
Let me know when you’re ready to help... Please!\nI really need this![VAR 0114(01E2)]
Meow!
[~ 7]
Are you ready to back me up?[VAR 0114(01E2)]
You got it!
Wait a sec
If you’re going to help me, then HELP me! I feel\nlike my heart is gonna jump out of my chest...[VAR 0114(01E2)]
Th-thank you...[VAR 0114(01E2)]
My date really likes Purrloin...\c\nSo I went and caught one for her, but I haven’t\nhad time to get to know it, or Purrloin in general...[VAR 0114(01E2)]
Meow!
Could you sit nearby and give me some pointers if\nneeded?[VAR 0114(01E2)]
She’ll be here soon...\c\nIf I can’t answer one of her questions, please tell\nme something good to say![VAR 0114(01E2)]
All you need in life are Purrloin, nice cafés, and\nstimulating conversation![VAR 0114(01E3)]
I’m sure you know what kind of Pokémon\nPurrloin is?[VAR 0114(01E3)]
Devious Pokémon
Cruel Pokémon
Intimidation Pokémon
Exactly! “Devious” describes Purrloin perfectly,\ndoesn’t it?[VAR 0114(01E3)]
Is that so? That doesn’t really sound like\nPurrloin...[VAR 0114(01E3)]
Do you know why Purrloin steals people’s things?[VAR 0114(01E3)]
It’s in order to survive
It just does that for fun
It doesn’t like Trainers
That’s right! With Purrloin, every day is a thrill![VAR 0114(01E3)]
Hmm... I remember Purrloin being more carefree\nthan that.[VAR 0114(01E3)]
You must know the move that Purrloin\nsurprisingly can’t learn on its own, right?[VAR 0114(01E3)]
Torment
Nasty Plot
Foul Play
Yup! You’d think Purrloin would be able to learn\nthat move, but it can’t! Funny, isn’t it?[VAR 0114(01E3)]
Really? I’m pretty sure Purrloin learns that move...[VAR 0114(01E3)]
Meooow!
It’s so fun talking with someone else who loves\nPurrloin! I could keep going for hours![VAR 0114(01E3)]
W-well, Félidie...it seems like Purrloin enjoys your\ncompany...[VAR 0114(01E2)]
Meooow!
And...I’ve enjoyed your company too!\c\nSo, it’d be great if we could maybe go out again\nsometime...[VAR 0114(01E2)]
Hmm... Well, you didn’t know enough about\nPurrloin for us to really have a fun chat.\c\nSo, yeah... Take care![VAR 0114(01E3)]
The requester blacked out!
Sure thing!\c\nI’d love to chat about Purrloin again![VAR 0114(01E3)]
Meooow! ♪
Th-thank you! I’ll...be right back.[VAR 0114(01E2)]
You’re a real lifesaver... I had no idea what she\nwas talking about...[VAR 0114(01E2)]
Thanks to you...I’ll be meeting up with her again!\nI’m forever grateful![VAR 0114(01E2)]
I’ll have to say goodbye to her now. I just hope\nshe doesn’t start talking about Purrloin again...[VAR 0114(01E2)]
[~ 49]
I’m still nervous, but if I can’t think of anything to\nsay, I’ll ask Félidie about the things that she likes.\r\nMaybe I’ll start opening up a little bit to her, too...[VAR 0114(01E2)]
Meooow!
If Frousse gets nervous and chokes up, Purrloin\nwill fill in the gaps! Frousse really caught a nice\r\nPurrloin, didn’t he?[VAR 0114(01E3)]

Hey. You there, Trainer. How about—?[VAR 0114(01E4)]
Jah!
Wait, Jolteon! I haven’t even had time to explai—![VAR 0114(01E4)]
And there it goes.[VAR 0114(01E4)]
My Jolteon is just far too hasty by nature.[VAR 0114(01E4)]
Even the slightest hint of battling in my\nPokémon’s future sends it running in a flash\r\ntoward the nearest battle court.[VAR 0114(01E4)]
Now that my Jolteon’s got its hopes up, I’d hate\nto let it down. Will you help me out and battle us?\r\nI’ll be waiting for you at the battle court![VAR 0114(01E4)]
[~ 7]
Hey! You’ll battle us, right?[VAR 0114(01E4)]
Jah!
Oh, come on! You haven’t even given h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]imer a\nchance to respond![VAR 0114(01E4)]
[~ 11]
That strength is just what I’d expect of Team MZ!\nYou’re the real deal.[VAR 0114(01E4)]
But you have to admit—Jolteon and the rest of my\nteam were fast, right? Their Hasty Natures help![VAR 0114(01E4)]
Some Pokémon’s Natures can make them even\nfaster in battle.[VAR 0114(01E4)]
A Hasty Nature will do that, of course—but the\nsame goes for a Timid, Jolly, or Naive Nature![VAR 0114(01E4)]
Being speedier helps a Pokémon out because it’ll\ntake less time between moves.[VAR 0114(01E4)]
But even the fastest Pokémon in the world would\nstill need about three seconds to reuse a move.[VAR 0114(01E4)]
Oh, and then you also have to consider—[VAR 0114(01E4)]
Jah!
Hey, now! Don’t run off to the Pokémon Center\nwithout me![VAR 0114(01E4)]
Guess I gotta dash! Thanks and bye![VAR 0114(01E4)]
[~ 22]
I’ve been dragged into all sorts of unexpected\nmisadventures chasing after my Hasty Jolteon.\r\nBut at least it usually ends up being fun.[VAR 0114(01E4)]
Jah!

Hey, Trainer. Have you ever paid attention to the\ntime it takes for moves to charge up?[VAR 0114(01E5)]
The longer a move charges up...[VAR 0114(01E5)]
The HARDER![VAR 0114(01E5)]
IT! HITS![VAR 0114(01E5)]
Let’s have a Pokémon battle. I’ll show you how a\ngood charge-up changes things![VAR 0114(01E5)]
Talk to me when you’re ready. I’ll just be here\nbiding my time and charging![VAR 0114(01E5)]
[~ 6]
I’m all charged up![VAR 0114(01E5)]
Ready to battle?[VAR 0114(01E5)]
Charge at me!
Nope, not yet
Cool. I’ll be here...charging EVEN MORE.[VAR 0114(01E5)]
HERE! WE![VAR 0114(01E5)]
GO!!![VAR 0114(01E5)]
[~ 14]
I’m all out of charge...[VAR 0114(01E5)]
But YOU![VAR 0114(01E5)]
You’re GOOD![VAR 0114(01E5)]
Here, take this TM and do some charging![VAR 0114(01E5)]
That’ll teach your Pokémon [VAR FF00(0006)]Skull Bash[VAR FF00(0000)]![VAR 0114(01E5)]
It’ll raise the user’s Defense while charging up,\nthen let loose a massive hit![VAR 0114(01E5)]
Use it good![VAR 0114(01E5)]
Make me proud![VAR 0114(01E5)]
[~ 23]
Apparently if you have your Pokémon hold a Quick\nClaw, it might not have to charge up for as long...\c\nI’d love to try it, but I’d be sad to lose out on that\nsweet charging time.[VAR 0114(01E5)]

What could be more marvelous, more miraculous,\nthan multistrike moves?![VAR 0114(01E6)]
They’re nimble![VAR 0114(01E6)]
They’re stylish![VAR 0114(01E6)]
They flow so elegantly![VAR 0114(01E6)]
Not to mention that you get to make a bunch of\nhits in a row.[VAR 0114(01E6)]
If every hit lands, think what a world of hurt your\nopponent will be in![VAR 0114(01E6)]
And if your opponent uses Protect, having a\nseries of staggered hits can let you get around it![VAR 0114(01E6)]
Plus, just think what multistrike moves can do if\nyou use an item to boost your critical-hit ratio...[VAR 0114(01E6)]
And I’m just getting started![VAR 0114(01E6)]
Um, can I interrupt?
You’re still going?!
Oh, pardon me! I unleashed a multi-sentence\nmove.\c\nWhere are my manners? I should show you the\nwonder of multistrike moves...in battle![VAR 0114(01E6)]
Please let me know when you’re ready to be\nmulti-struck with awe.[VAR 0114(01E6)]
[~ 13]
Ready to see if you can withstand my multistrike\nonslaught?[VAR 0114(01E6)]
I’m ready!
I’m not ready
Quite understandable. Please do take the time to\nprepare well.[VAR 0114(01E6)]
Then prepare for an unrelenting—![VAR 0114(01E6)]
Overwhelming—![VAR 0114(01E6)]
Marvelous buffet of multistriking![VAR 0114(01E6)]
[~ 21]
Marvelous.[VAR 0114(01E6)]
You fought wonderfully. I’ve much to reflect on.[VAR 0114(01E6)]
For example, not every blow in a multistrike move\nwill always land...[VAR 0114(01E6)]
not to mention that while your Pokémon is using\na move, it’s wide open to being attacked...[VAR 0114(01E6)]
Timing, positioning—there’s so much to consider!\nI need to battle more. Perhaps then I can see if—[VAR 0114(01E6)]
Um... Excuse me?
You’re still going?!
Oh, pardon me! I unleashed another multi-\nsentence move.\c\nPlease, accept this TM with my apologies.[VAR 0114(01E6)]
[VAR FF00(0006)]Triple Axel[VAR FF00(0000)] is an Ice-type move in which the user\ndelivers three graceful jumping blows.[VAR 0114(01E6)]
But that’s not all—each jump is higher than the\nlast and hits a wider radius too![VAR 0114(01E6)]
Ah, the joy of landing each attack... The thrill of\nstrategizing around a sequence of strikes...\c\nI hope you’ll join me in sharing the delight of\nmultistrike moves![VAR 0114(01E6)]
[~ 33]

Kid, do you know what all Pokémon battles really\nhinge on?[VAR 0114(01E7)]
Your offense!
Your defense!
Your strategy!
The whims of fate!
Pffft! Like you could’ve gotten the answer![VAR 0114(01E7)]
Listen good. Pokémon battles hinge on...[VAR 0114(01E7)]
SHEER SPEED![VAR 0114(01E7)]
You can swoop in on an opponent or dodge an\nattack at a key moment—if you move fast enough![VAR 0114(01E7)]
Me and my Cyclizar roll all around Lumiose every\nday, and we’ve learned moves that let ’em roll over\r\nopponents even faster![VAR 0114(01E7)]
We’re the fastest in town—which means you’ll\nnever beat us![VAR 0114(01E7)]
Agyaoh!

You...you sure kept up with us![VAR 0114(01E7)]
You’re really good! Guess we need to knuckle\ndown and get even speedier...[VAR 0114(01E7)]
Take this TM. You deserve it.[VAR 0114(01E7)]
[VAR FF00(0006)]Flame Charge[VAR FF00(0000)] doesn’t just deal damage—it lets\nyour Pokémon move faster.[VAR 0114(01E7)]
Trust me—there’s no feeling quite like running\ncircles around your opponent![VAR 0114(01E7)]
All right, Cyclizar crew! Let’s ride all around\nLumiose to our hearts’ content![VAR 0114(01E7)]

You there.\c\nDo you wish to learn the ultimate in secret,\nmysterious techniques?[VAR 0114(01E9)]
Sorry, who are you?[VAR 0114(01E9)]
Go on, I’m listening[VAR 0114(01E9)]
Yes, I think you look quite suited to this...\nVery well.[VAR 0114(01E9)]
Charizard, Blaziken, Emboar, and Delphox...\c\nBlastoise, Swampert, Feraligatr, and Greninja...\c\nVenusaur, Sceptile, Meganium, and Chesnaught...\nWhat do they all have in common?[VAR 0114(01E9)]
Only they can learn the ultimate moves that I am\nwilling to teach you![VAR 0114(01E9)]
But to earn them, you’ll need to defeat trios of\nPokémon using only a single Pokémon of your\r\nown—which I will specify.[VAR 0114(01E9)]
Such are the trials that await you. Do you have\nwhat it takes to see them through?[VAR 0114(01E9)]
If you’d like to try, simply let me know.[VAR 0114(01E9)]
[~ 9]
So, you’re curious about my ultimate techniques.[VAR 0114(01E9)]
In that case, three trials await you.[VAR 0114(01E9)]
In each one, you must battle and defeat me using\nonly a single Pokémon of your own...[VAR 0114(01E9)]
There is the Trial of Grass, where you’ll use\nMeganium to defeat three Fire-type Pokémon.[VAR 0114(01E9)]
The Trial of Fire will pit your Emboar against three\nWater-type Pokémon.[VAR 0114(01E9)]
And the Trial of Water calls upon you and your\nFeraligatr to defeat three Grass-type Pokémon.[VAR 0114(01E9)]
You must pass each trial to earn the right to learn\none of my ultimate techniques.[VAR 0114(01E9)]
We can begin anytime you’re ready.[VAR 0114(01E9)]
Will you attempt a trial?[VAR 0114(01E9)]
The Trial of Grass!
The Trial of Fire!
The Trial of Water!
How’s this work again?
I’m good for now
For each of the three trials, you must take down\nmy three Pokémon using only a single Pokémon\r\nthat I specify.[VAR 0114(01E9)]
Do hurry and see if you can clear all three trials.\nWaiting bores me.[VAR 0114(01E9)]
You’ll need a single Meganium and no more to\nattempt the Trial of Grass.[VAR 0114(01E9)]
You’ll need a single Emboar and no more to\nattempt the Trial of Fire.[VAR 0114(01E9)]
You’ll need a single Feraligatr and no more to\nattempt the Trial of Water.[VAR 0114(01E9)]
Excellent. Let the Trial of Grass begin![VAR 0114(01E9)]
Excellent. Let the Trial of Fire begin![VAR 0114(01E9)]

In honor of your success in the Trial of Fire, and\nfor this step toward mastering all of my ultimate\r\ntechniques, I give you this TM![VAR 0114(01E9)]
In honor of your success in the Trial of Water, and\nfor this step toward mastering all of my ultimate\r\ntechniques, I give you this TM![VAR 0114(01E9)]

[~ 38]
At last! You’ve done it![VAR 0114(01E9)]
My truest congratulations. You’ve cleared all three\nof my trials.[VAR 0114(01E9)]
These ultimate techniques boast tremendous\npower, but their recoil leaves the user wide-open.[VAR 0114(01E9)]
It takes a Trainer with a discerning tactical mind\nto use them properly.[VAR 0114(01E9)]
I trust you’ll work hard to be such a Trainer.[VAR 0114(01E9)]
[~ 44]
The ultimate techniques I taught you boast\ntremendous power, but their recoil leaves the\r\nuser open to attack.\c\nKeep refining your judgment and tactical sense so\nyou can use these moves to their fullest.[VAR 0114(01E9)]

Have you heard? There’s been some trouble\nwithin Quasartico over our guard Pokémon.[VAR 0114(01EA)]

[VAR BD06(0000)]Not that I’m blaming you personally,\n[VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(01EA)]

There was a great deal of debate over what we\nshould do to avoid such trouble in the future...\r\nand the solution we landed on was Morpeko.[VAR 0114(01EA)]

I’m sure you’ve heard, haven’t you? About a\ncertain Pokémon?\c\nThe Pokémon called...Genesect?
Yes, I have
No, I haven’t
Good on you for admitting it. That takes integrity.
Hm. Well, I believe you...but I’ve been itching to\ntell someone about it, so humor me.
Genesect is an ancient bug Pokémon. Apparently,\nit was altered by a certain organization.\c\nIt also can be equipped with four different kinds\nof drives...or so they say.
Four drives I just so happen to have acquired.
Why don’t you buy them off me? I’ve got some\nvery interesting info to share once you get all four.
[~ 8]
Did you not hear me? I said to get all four drives.\nThey’re yours—if you bring me the Mega Shards.\c\nAnd if you’ve given any shards to a Pokémon to\nhold, hurry up and put them back in your satchel.
Look at that. You got all four drives.\c\nThat took some effort. You’ve earned my special\nbit of intel.
Get ready for a beep from your Rotom Phone...\nIt’s about to get some intriguing information!
Go on. Check out the location I sent you.
[~ 13]
That’s it! That’s Genesect!\c\nCatch it! Do you hear me? CATCH IT!
[~ 15]
I. Said. CATCH IT!
[~ 17]
Look at you! Quite a feat.
Wasn’t that an interesting time?\c\nI’ll be around if you want to trade more. Don’t be\na stranger!

Oh—you’re [VAR 0100(0000)], yes?\c\nDo you remember me? I’m the representative of\nthe Lumiose Safety Group. My name’s Gardie.[VAR 0114(01EC)]
I wish we’d met under better circumstances. It\nwasn’t exactly decorous to surround the CEO of\r\nQuasartico Inc. and pelt accusations at her.[VAR 0114(01EC)]
On behalf of our group, please accept my most\nsincere apologies![VAR 0114(01EC)]
We can’t protect Lumiose’s integrity and manners\nif we can’t maintain our own, after all.[VAR 0114(01EC)]
The peace and calm of our city’s citizens is the\nLumiose Safety Group’s North Star![VAR 0114(01EC)]
Unfortunately, that peace and calm is now under\nthreat once more.\c\nThere’s a popular account online called the Hex\nManiac Channel that’s been sharing videos about\r\noccult phenomena.[VAR 0114(01EC)]
Alas, their content has stirred discontent in our\nfair city![VAR 0114(01EC)]
And no wonder—they make terrifying claims!\nFor example, they say there’s a ghostly woman\r\nhaunting a building on North Boulevard![VAR 0114(01EC)]
If they’re spreading misinformation, then they’ll\nbe hearing from us—in no uncertain terms![VAR 0114(01EC)]
We just need to catch them peddling a baseless\nrumor. For that, we need you to investigate one of\r\ntheir posts, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(01EC)]
Here’s a recent post of theirs. This should give\nyou a lead to follow.[VAR 0114(01EC)]
“At the hour when the grandest shadow’s tip\npierces the center of the circle of red and white...\c\n“they who dare thrust their fist toward the earth\nmay find a ghostly child creeping near.\c\n“Is this true? Find out for yourself, if you dare...\nTruth is in the eye of the beholder.”[VAR 0114(01EC)]
There you have it. Could they be telling the truth,\nor are they making it all up for the clout?\c\nPlease look into it for us. I’m sure you can do it![VAR 0114(01EC)]
Please find out if what the Hex Maniac Channel\nposted is true. Here’s what they said:\c\n“At the hour when the grandest shadow’s tip\npierces the center of the circle of red and white...\c\n“they who dare thrust their fist toward the earth\nmay find a ghostly child creeping near.”[VAR 0114(01EC)]
[~ 14]
You have a feeling this is the spot the Hex Maniac\nChannel mentioned, but something’s not right...
The tower’s shadow is falling across the spot that\nthe Hex Maniac Channel mentioned.
Will you thrust your fist toward the earth?
Ground, meet fist!
Nah, sounds painful
Aha—I’ve made it in time! Let’s see together\nwhether this ghost story is true![VAR 0114(01EC)]
Is...is this that “ghostly child”?![VAR 0114(01EC)]
Catch it! That’s the only way we can know for sure\nwhether the story was true![VAR 0114(01EC)]
[~ 23]
No, no, no! You’ve got to catch it![VAR 0114(01EC)]
[~ 25]
Fascinating.[VAR 0114(01EC)]
So this is what the Hex Maniac Channel was\nreferring to.[VAR 0114(01EC)]
Which means...they’re not spreading baseless\nrumors.[VAR 0114(01EC)]
I suppose I’ll report to the rest of the group that\nthis channel’s not fraudulent after all.[VAR 0114(01EC)]
Thank you for your assistance![VAR 0114(01EC)]
Could this mean...[VAR 0114(01EC)]
There really IS a ghostly woman haunting that\nbuilding on North Boulevard?![VAR 0114(01EC)]
[~ 33]
Given how well you protected the city during that\nincident with the tower, we could really use you\r\nin the Lumiose Safety Group![VAR 0114(01EC)]

Since you’re here, would you care to take a look at\nthis?[VAR 0114(000D)]
What is it?
A...Poké Ball?
It is a Pokémon that was made by human hands\nsome 500 years ago. It is called Magearna.[VAR 0114(000D)]
We recovered it during our redevelopment work,\nbut it appears to be in a dormant state.[VAR 0114(000E)]
If we want to awaken it, we must find a way to\npower its internal mechanisms.[VAR 0114(000E)]
To do so would require a Mega Stone specific to\nMagearna.[VAR 0114(000D)]
We had asked AZ to create one for us, but since\nthat will unfortunately no longer be possible...\c\nWe will have our team here at Quasartico Inc.\nproduce the stone.[VAR 0114(000D)]
Can we ask you to assist us with gathering the\nnecessary materials, [VAR 0100(0000)]?\c\nWe will require [VAR FF00(0006)]999 Mega Shards[VAR FF00(0000)] to create this\nparticular Mega Stone.[VAR 0114(000D)]
Magearna is in a dormant state.
[~ 11]
[VAR BD06(0000)]We require [VAR FF00(0006)]999 Mega Shards[VAR FF00(0000)],\n[VAR 0100(0000)].\c\nWe truly appreciate your help.[VAR 0114(000D)]

We’ll have the team get started at once to\nproduce a Mega Stone for Magearna.[VAR 0114(000E)]
Magearna’s Mega Stone is ready. Here it is—\nMagearnite.[VAR 0114(000E)]

Um... A Pokémon I’ve never seen before appeared,\nand I don’t know what to make of it...[VAR 0114(01EF)]
It looked squishy...yet somehow sturdy...[VAR 0114(01EF)]
I think it might have come out of one of those\ndistortion things I’ve been hearing about...[VAR 0114(01EF)]
Up there—that’s the Pokémon![VAR 0114(01EF)]
Nmeh!
If we chase it off, I worry it’d just come back and\ncause more trouble...\c\nDo you think you could catch it?[VAR 0114(01EF)]

It’s bad news time![VAR 0114(0007)]
Listen, you won’t believe this—I found a hacked\nPoké Ball.[VAR 0114(0007)]
Poké Balls can be hacked?
What are you talking about?
Ah. I suppose you wouldn’t know. Poké Ball\nhacking was something Team Flare looked into\r\nback in the day.\c\nOur scientists developed a way to infect a Poké\nBall with a computer virus and mess with it in\r\ndifferent ways—even render it unusable.[VAR 0114(0007)]
Awful, right?\c\nImagine what a nightmare it would’ve been for\nKalos if this technology got out.[VAR 0114(0007)]
And now it’s give-you-a-task time![VAR 0114(0007)]
That’s the hacked Poké Ball. Would you believe\nit’s got the Pokémon called [VAR FF00(0006)]Volcanion[VAR FF00(0000)] inside?[VAR 0114(0007)]
I’d love to know how a Mythical Pokémon that\nrare got caught in the first place, but I digress.[VAR 0114(0007)]
Since this Poké Ball’s hacked, it’s unusable now.\nI want to let Volcanion out, but once I do, well...\r\nVolcanion will be out. It’ll probably be battle time.[VAR 0114(0007)]
And that’s your time to shine, lackey!\c\nOnce I set Volcanion loose, catch it again—but in\na ball that actually works this time![VAR 0114(0007)]
Let me know when you’re ready to take on and\ncatch Volcanion![VAR 0114(0007)]
[~ 12]
Ready to take on Volcanion? Got the right\nPokémon and items with you? Got the guts?[VAR 0114(0007)]
Yeah, I got ’em
Not just yet...
Well, get ’em. Can’t keep Volcanion waiting![VAR 0114(0007)]
Good for you, my brave little teacher’s pet. Now\nlet’s get going![VAR 0114(0007)]
There’s just one minor problem.\c\nI’ve whacked together a device that should let us\nwipe out the virus, so we can open the Poké Ball\r\nwithout destroying it. But...[VAR 0114(0007)]
“But”?
Uh-oh
Well, since the Poké Ball’s got such a mighty\nPokémon in it, I had to use...creative methods\r\nto find a way to get the thing open.\c\nI can basically guarantee that once Volcanion gets\nfree, you’re gonna be dealing with one angry,\r\npowerful opponent.[VAR 0114(0007)]
But you’ve got nothing to worry about, because I\nwent and called in a Volcanion expert to help us.[VAR 0114(0007)]
There are Volcanion experts?
You found someone like that?
I’m the Volcanion expert![VAR 0114(0030)]
I’ve jogged through every street in this city, so I\nknew the quickest route here from Lumiose Press![VAR 0114(0030)]
You remember Ms. Yvon from the Z-A Royale?\nWell, she’s an associate editor at Lumiose Press.\r\nShe found a top-secret memo about Volcanion![VAR 0114(0007)]
The person who wrote this memo about the\nsecret of Volcanion’s power had this to say:\c\n“In order to cause a steam explosion powerful\nenough to blow up mountains, the Pokémon must\r\nhave an organ with extremely high temperature\r\nthat can instantly vaporize water into steam.”[VAR 0114(0030)]
They also talk more about how great its power\ncan be—enough to change Kalos’s geography!\c\n“In the southern part of the Kalos region, there\nseems to be a custom to revere Volcanion as a\r\nnation-building Pokémon.”\c\nWhat’s more, “People seem to believe that a steam\nexplosion caused by Volcanion created the plain\r\nwhere they live.”[VAR 0114(0030)]
It sounds ridiculously powerful![VAR 0114(0007)]
It’s true that there once was a huge mountain\nrange in southern Kalos...until it was obliterated\r\nin a massive explosion of unknown origin.[VAR 0114(0030)]
Smells like Volcanion to me.[VAR 0114(0007)]
This isn’t making me thrilled about what could\nhappen when it gets out...but no matter what,\r\nwe can’t just leave it stuck in a hacked Poké Ball.[VAR 0114(0007)]
So with that, I guess it’s time to introduce you to\nthis lab’s basement![VAR 0114(0007)]
[~ 35]
Hey, [VAR 0100(0000)]. You copy?[VAR 0114(0007)]
Yvon and I are gonna be cheering you on from\noutside that room![VAR 0114(0007)]
We would come in with you, but...y’know. We like\nstaying alive.[VAR 0114(0007)]
Now toss out that Poké Ball with Volcanion in it![VAR 0114(0007)]
Yeah, that sure looks like one feisty opponent!\nGood luck in there![VAR 0114(0007)]
VwwoooOOOAAARRR!
[~ 42]
Did you not hear me when I said to CATCH IT?![VAR 0114(0007)]
[~ 44]
Ding-ding-ding! Yup, you did it! To the victor\ngoes...Volcanion![VAR 0114(0007)]
Strange how even the most riled-up Pokémon will\nchill out once you catch it, huh?[VAR 0114(0007)]
[~ 47]
My pulse is still racing from watching you go toe\nto toe with a Mythical Pokémon![VAR 0114(0030)]
If I could perhaps ask for one small favor in return\nfor the info I provided...\c\nWould you mind letting Volcanion do away with\nsome parts of Lumiose? Just enough to clear a\r\nnice, long track for a marath—[VAR 0114(0030)]
Yeah, no. That’s not happening.[VAR 0114(0007)]
I was only joking, of course!\c\nAnyway, I think I can get a fantastic article out of\nall this. My editor in chief won’t believe her eyes![VAR 0114(0030)]
On that note, time to jog back to work. Lumiose\nPress won’t wait for me![VAR 0114(0030)]
I kind of get how Volcanion must’ve felt, losing its\nfreedom thanks to Team Flare’s misdeeds...\c\nNot that my gilded cage is exactly the same as\nbeing stuck in a hacked Poké Ball.[VAR 0114(0007)]
At least now Volcanion’s got a new partner![VAR 0114(0007)]
You get to show it all kinds of interesting stuff to\nsee and do—the way only a Pokémon Trainer can.[VAR 0114(0007)]
I’ve gotten to see some pretty neat things thanks\nto you and your buds, too, I guess. What a ride.[VAR 0114(0007)]
Now get lost, kid! Till next time, maybe![VAR 0114(0007)]

I’ve just had a vision—a vision of a wonderful\nnew donut![VAR 0114(01A5)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Give me just a moment,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(01A5)]
All right! I’ve come up with a suitable recipe.[VAR 0114(01A5)]
This donut’s flavor profile must have at least\n40 points in sweet, 200 in spicy, 400 in sour,\r\n280 in bitter, and 40 in fresh.[VAR 0114(01A5)]
Let me know when you’d like to try making it![VAR 0114(01A5)]
[~ 13]
The [VAR FF00(0006)]Plasma-Glazed Donut[VAR FF00(0000)] turned out as lovely—\nand shocking—as I’d hoped. It does the Popping\r\nCandy justice![VAR 0114(01A5)]
I wonder what fascinating pocket of Hyperspace\nLumiose awaits you once Hoopa eats this donut.[VAR 0114(01A5)]
[VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0008)]
I need you to come to the [VAR FF00(0006)]station front[VAR FF00(0000)], ASAP![VAR 0114(0008)]
It sounds like trouble’s come calling again.\c\nBut whatever it is, I know you can take care of it,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(01A5)]
[~ 19]
Look up there![VAR 0114(0008)]
I bet even you haven’t seen a hyperspace\ndistortion quite like that before, have you?[VAR 0114(0008)]
I sure haven’t
Yellow is new
I called you because I don’t know what kind of\nPokémon might be waiting in there.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Hey, kid. Got a favor to ask.[VAR 0114(0013)]
We’ve picked up on a real beast of a hyperspace\ndistortion!\c\nI’ll bet there’s one heck of a powerful Pokémon in\nthere. If it Rogue Mega Evolves, we’re in trouble.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Can you and the rest of your usual trio handle it?\nI’ll contact Ms. Mega Stones and your buddy.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Oh, and before I forget—the distortion’s at the\n[VAR FF00(0006)]station front[VAR FF00(0000)] of the Gare de Lumiose.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Yup, I’m right there
Yeah, we found it
Ha! I should’ve guessed. In that case, do your\nthing![VAR 0114(0013)]
You know, Corbeau honestly might make a good\nmayor or something.[VAR 0114(0008)]
It’s Korrina time![VAR 0114(0192)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Hey, [VAR 0100(0000)]. Bad\nnews—[VAR 018B(0001)]\r\ncan’t\r\nmake it.[VAR 0114(0192)]
It’ll have to be just you and me on this one.[VAR 0114(0192)]
I could fill in.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Oh! You’re...Emma, right?[VAR 0114(0192)]
Yes! We met in Hyperspace Lumiose just before\nOperation Mega Donut.[VAR 0114(0008)]
I’ve heard you’re a dab hand with Mega Evolution\nyourself![VAR 0114(0192)]
Let’s do it! A new trio debuts![VAR 0114(0192)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Let me know when you’re ready to do this,\n[VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0008)]
[~ 42]
Ready to dive on in?[VAR 0114(0192)]
Let’s go!
I need to prepare
A new trio debuts! Better make sure you’re extra\nprepared.[VAR 0114(0192)]
I’m ready to go when you are. We’ve got to keep\nLumiose safe![VAR 0114(0008)]
Hold on, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nDon’t go in with all your Boxes full. You’re gonna\nneed to catch whatever Pokémon’s in there![VAR 0114(0008)]
My detective’s instinct is telling me you’ll need a\nparticular donut for this special distortion![VAR 0114(0008)]
[~ 50]
Zeraora?![VAR 0114(0192)]
That’s one of the mightiest Electric-type Pokémon\nthere is...\c\nI can’t imagine how bad things could get if\nRogue Mega Zeraora were on the loose![VAR 0114(0192)]
Wow, Korrina—it’s strong enough to intimidate a\nTrainer of your caliber?[VAR 0114(0008)]
Ha! You kidding?[VAR 0114(0192)]
We get to go all out against the mighty Zeraora!\nI’m thrilled![VAR 0114(0192)]
And I’m glad we get to release it from the pain of\nRogue Mega Evolution too![VAR 0114(0192)]
The concentration of Mega Power in your vicinity\nis rising rapidly!\c\nWarning: Rogue Mega Evolution is imminent!
[~ 58]
GROOOAR!
[VAR BD06(0000)]Go on and catch Zeraora,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0192)]
You were truly mighty, Zeraora. Respect.[VAR 0114(0192)]
Zeraora has occasionally turned up in human\ntowns, looking as if it’s hungry for battle.\c\nI’ve heard it sometimes even acts like a bodyguard\nfor people.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Maybe this pocket of Hyperspace Lumiose was\nborn from its hunger for a good battle.[VAR 0114(0192)]
I guess we’re done here. Let’s head back to our\nregular old Lumiose![VAR 0114(0008)]
[~ 65]
Now I’ve got a better idea of how you two have\nbeen protecting Lumiose all this time.[VAR 0114(0008)]
It really is hard work, so thank you for doing it![VAR 0114(0008)]
Aww, Emma, we should be thanking you. We\ncouldn’t have handled Zeraora without your help![VAR 0114(0192)]
I’m here, I’m here! Sorry I’m late![VAR 0114(0006)]
I’m here, I’m here! Sorry I’m late![VAR 0114(0005)]
We, uh... We’re done already.[VAR 0114(0192)]
You’re what?\c\nWait...Emma? Don’t tell me...[VAR 0114(0006)]
You’re what?\c\nWait...Emma? Don’t tell me...[VAR 0114(0005)]
That’s right—I did my best to fill your shoes in\nHyperspace Lumiose![VAR 0114(0008)]
Yup! Lumiose officially has a new toughest trio![VAR 0114(0192)]
N-no way![VAR 0114(0006)]

Oh, are you not feeling up to making a donut?
Let’s continue!
I’m done for now
Order received! Let me get started at once.
I don’t think I can make the donut you want with\nthis combination of ingredients...
I’d be happy to make you another donut, but you\nwouldn’t have any room for it, would you?
That donut turned out beautifully! Would you like\nto make another?
I think having a goodly supply of donuts will do\nwonders for your hyperspace surveys!
Make a different donut
Make another of the same
Maybe later...
Please select three Berries for me to use. You can\nchoose whichever three you like.
Welcome to Ansha’s Donuts!
I’d like to make a donut
I’d like to try that cruller recipe
I’d like to try that “Alpha” recipe
I’d like to try that “Omega” recipe
I’d like to try that “Delta” recipe
I’d like to try that “Plasma” recipe
Never mind
If you’re interested in a donut, I will need at least\nthree Berries!
I’ll try using that Nice Butter you brought back, if\nyou don’t mind, [VAR 0100(0000)]!
You can now make donuts using four Berries!
I’ll try using that Great Butter you brought back, if\nyou don’t mind, [VAR 0100(0000)]!

There’s a new side mission waiting for you atop\nHotel Z!
Head to the Hotel Z rooftop!
[~ 2]
Would you be [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0004)]
I would indeed
Who are YOU?
Why are you on the roof?
Delightful![VAR 0114(0004)]
Now, now! All in good time.[VAR 0114(0004)]
An air of mystery makes for a compelling scene,\ndon’t you think?[VAR 0114(0004)]
Please excuse the altitude and allow me to\nintroduce myself.[VAR 0114(0004)]
My name is Ansha.[VAR 0114(01A5)]
And this is Hoopa, the Mischief Pokémon.[VAR 0114(01A5)]
Pii hya hya!
I’ve come to your hotel rooftop with a particular\nrequest.[VAR 0114(01A5)]
A request fit for Lumiose’s renowned Team MZ!\nIf you’re willing to hear it, of course...[VAR 0114(01A5)]
Of course I am!
Let me hear it
How agreeable! Thank you![VAR 0114(01A5)]
Then without further ado...[VAR 0114(01A5)]
Help me make a delicious donut that will fill\nHoopa with a great surge of power![VAR 0114(01A5)]
[~ 21]
A donut? This sure is a cute request.[VAR 0114(000C)]
I agree, but it’s a bit odd. Why here at Hotel Z?\nWhy not make one at home?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Why’s not important. She asked us for help, so\nwe’re gonna help![VAR 0114(0006)]
Doesn’t matter why—I’m not gonna turn down a\nkid in need of help![VAR 0114(0005)]
All right. So we’ve got to provide a space and find\nsome ingredients?[VAR 0114(000C)]
You got it![VAR 0114(0006)]
Right![VAR 0114(0005)]
Donuts have to be fried in oil that’s at least 350\ndegrees Fahrenheit. She’ll need supervision.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Oh, good point! That must be why she came to\nTeam MZ for help![VAR 0114(000C)]
Does that really make sense to you? I still don’t\nsee why she couldn’t ask her parents...[VAR 0114(000B)]
Ansha? Something on your mind?[VAR 0114(000C)]
It’s just that this hotel’s different from the one I’m\nused to. It feels...calmer.[VAR 0114(01A5)]
Well, calm is good for making donuts, right? No\ndistractions![VAR 0114(0006)]

Shucks. If you say so.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Right?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Oh, wait![VAR 0114(0006)]
Oh no![VAR 0114(0005)]
I just remembered I used up all our butter.[VAR 0114(0006)]
I’m guessing you’ll need butter, but I used up the\nlast of ours yesterday. Sorry, Ansha.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Oh, dear. Butter is crucial to the recipe...[VAR 0114(01A5)]
Never fear!
We’ll get some
Hang tight for a bit, Ansha.\c\nI know a place that’s got really great butter. I’m\ngonna see if I can get us some![VAR 0114(0006)]
Hold tight for a bit, Ansha.\c\nI know a place that has really great butter. I’ll see\nif I can get us some![VAR 0114(0005)]
I’ll head to the baker’s stall in [VAR FF00(0006)]Magenta Sector 6[VAR FF00(0000)].\nMeet me there, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0006)]
Meet me at the baker’s stall in [VAR FF00(0006)]Magenta Sector 6[VAR FF00(0000)],\nall right, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Have a pleasant trip![VAR 0114(01A5)]
In the meantime, I’ll prepare everything else we\nneed to make that donut.[VAR 0114(01A5)]
I’ll lend a hand. Bizarre as this request may be, we\ngave our word we’d help.[VAR 0114(000B)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Good luck with that butter,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(000C)]
Go grab us some butter from that bakery stall in\nMagenta Sector 6![VAR 0114(000C)]
Donuts are dangerous business. The oil gets\nscalding hot.[VAR 0114(000B)]
You won’t find finer donuts than the ones I make![VAR 0114(01A5)]
Pii hya hya.
Kyururu.
[~ 61]
The baker here should hook us up with some\nbutter![VAR 0114(0006)]
We can get the best butter in Lumiose from the\nbaker here![VAR 0114(0005)]
Oh, hello, [VAR 018B(0001)]. After some Lumiosian Butter?\nYou’re in luck. I’ve got one pack left—all yours.
I once helped the baker here out of a jam while I\nwas out being my usual helpful self. Now she\r\nshares her ingredients with me sometimes.[VAR 0114(0006)]
I once helped the baker here out of a jam while I\nwas out being my usual helpful self. Now she\r\nhooks me up with ingredients sometimes.[VAR 0114(0005)]

Grisham?[VAR 0114(0005)]
And...Tarragon?[VAR 0114(0006)]
And...Tarragon?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Since when do you two hang out?[VAR 0114(0006)]
Didn’t expect to see you two all buddy-buddy.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Well, kid, I got to thinkin’ we needed some new\nmerch to keep the Canatics happy![VAR 0114(0010)]
It’s my brainchild for my grandchild: Canari Bread!\nHer fans are gonna eat it up![VAR 0114(0010)]
And ol’ Grisham here agreed to teach me the\nsecrets of bread-makin’ as his apprentice![VAR 0114(0010)]
I never agreed to an apprenticeship, but I mustn’t\nextinguish the passion of a budding baker.[VAR 0114(0017)]
Unfortunately, this leaves us with a problem to be\nsolved, doesn’t it?[VAR 0114(0017)]
Yep. This Lumiosian Butter isn’t big enough for\nthe both of us.\c\nThis calls for a two-on-two battle! Winners bring\nhome the butter![VAR 0114(0006)]
Yep. This Lumiosian Butter isn’t big enough for\nthe both of us.\c\nThis calls for a two-on-two battle! Winners bring\nhome the butter![VAR 0114(0005)]

We’ll sear anyone that tries to hold us back! Let’s\nignite with Mega Evolution, Charizard!
Do ya know how Excadrill Mega Evolves? We\nbond over how badly we wanna win!
[~ 85]
So long, Canari Bread... You were a beautiful\ndream for the Canatics and me...[VAR 0114(0010)]
I suppose it’s no surprise our teamwork was\nlacking. Tarragon doesn’t even drink coffee.[VAR 0114(0017)]
Sorry, but a deal’s a deal.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Sorry, but a deal’s a deal.[VAR 0114(0005)]
So it’s time for the finest butter in Kalos! I’ll take\nthat Lumiosian Butter, please![VAR 0114(0006)]
So it’s time for the finest butter in Kalos! I’ll take\nthat Lumiosian Butter, please![VAR 0114(0005)]

This’ll be good enough even for Ansha’s\nstandards![VAR 0114(0005)]

You gotta make that Canari Bread. Naveen’ll be\nthrilled![VAR 0114(0005)]
You got it, kid!\c\nI’ll make a masterpiece even Grisham’s croissants\ncan’t hold a candle to! This apprentice is gonna\r\noutbake the master![VAR 0114(0010)]
I still haven’t agreed to make you my apprentice.\c\nBut if I’m to teach you, I’ll expect no less than the\nfinest of breads from you.[VAR 0114(0017)]
One look at your scaffolding courses tells me that\nyour drive to create burns white-hot.[VAR 0114(0017)]
So I’ll teach you with a heat that’s just as intense.\nBe warned.[VAR 0114(0017)]
Works for me! Just wait—yer apprentice’ll rise to\nthe occasion![VAR 0114(0010)]
I never would’ve expected those two to get along.[VAR 0114(0006)]
They make a fun pair.[VAR 0114(0005)]
All right. I gotta go take care of some business at\nQuasartico.\c\nCould you bring Ansha this Lumiosian Butter?\nThanks, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0006)]
OK, duty calls. I gotta go take care of some stuff at\nQuasartico.\c\nCould you bring Ansha this Lumiosian Butter?\nThanks, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0005)]
You got some Lumiosian Butter from [VAR 018B(0001)]!
I’ll come meet up with you all as soon as my work\nstuff is taken care of![VAR 0114(0006)]
I’ll come meet up with you all as soon as I’m\nfinished at work![VAR 0114(0005)]
[~ 110]
How marvelously this turned out![VAR 0114(01A5)]
Oh, welcome back, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(000C)]
Welcome indeed—to Ansha’s Donuts![VAR 0114(01A5)]
Wow, great storefront!
All this to make one donut?
If you want to make a proper donut, the ambience\nneeds to be just right.[VAR 0114(01A5)]
Look, I buy that reasoning. But it’s quite a lot if\nyou only mean to cook here this once.[VAR 0114(000B)]
You’re getting concerned now, Naveen? You sure\nseemed eager to help us make all this![VAR 0114(000C)]
We gave our word that we’d help, that’s all.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Were you able to get your hands on that butter,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(01A5)]
I sure was!
Here it is!
You showed Ansha the Lumiosian Butter!
Goodness—Lumiosian Butter! I’m told it’s some\nof the finest Kalos has to offer.\c\nIf there’s better butter to be had anywhere, I’d\nlike to see it![VAR 0114(01A5)]
That should be it, right? Now Ansha can go ahead\nand make that donut she wants.[VAR 0114(000C)]
You poor, misguided thing—my establishment’s\ndonuts are made to order. Didn’t you realize?[VAR 0114(01A5)]
Which means my request entails a bit more work\nfor you, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(01A5)]
I’d like you to choose a donut for us to make![VAR 0114(01A5)]
Go on! Order a donut from Ansha![VAR 0114(000C)]
I’m rather curious myself about what type of\ndonut she’ll make.[VAR 0114(000B)]
[~ 131]
Welcome, dear customer, to Ansha’s Donuts![VAR 0114(01A5)]
If you pick three Berries, we’ll make them into a\nlovely donut.[VAR 0114(01A5)]
Here, I’ve got some Berries on me![VAR 0114(000C)]
Excellent. We’re all set for Berries.[VAR 0114(01A5)]
Now, order away![VAR 0114(01A5)]
One lovely donut, ready to eat![VAR 0114(01A5)]
Ansha got a donut!
Pii hya!
Now, let’s be off to our destination, Hoopa![VAR 0114(01A5)]
You’re not gonna eat here?[VAR 0114(000C)]
If you recall, the thrust of my request was to make\na donut that would give Hoopa a surge of power![VAR 0114(01A5)]
I need to put Hoopa’s surge of power to use at a\nparticular spot.[VAR 0114(01A5)]
That spot lies [VAR FF00(0006)]on the banks of the Saison Canal[VAR FF00(0000)]![VAR 0114(01A5)]
It’s close to the Justice Dojo.[VAR 0114(01A5)]
I no longer understand what Ansha’s trying to do.\nDo you?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Ansha, could you let us in on what your plan is\nhere?[VAR 0114(000C)]
Certainly! I owe you all at least that much.[VAR 0114(01A5)]
I suppose you can even come along and see. Let’s\nreconvene along the Saison Canal banks![VAR 0114(01A5)]
C’mon! Let’s hustle over to the Saison Canal\nbanks, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(000C)]
Is this donut shop going to be a permanent\nfixture?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Kyururu.
[~ 153]
It seems everyone is here except for [VAR 018B(0001)].[VAR 0114(01A5)]
Wait up! You asked for Team MZ’s help—don’t\nleave out the leader![VAR 0114(0006)]
Wait up! You asked for Team MZ’s help—don’t\nleave out the leader![VAR 0114(0005)]
Very well! Now that [VAR 018B(0001)] has arrived, let’s\nbegin.[VAR 0114(01A5)]
Hang on, Ansha.\c\nI’m here for whatever’s about to happen, but you\nstill haven’t told us what you’re trying to do![VAR 0114(000C)]
Oh, yes. I’m sorry—I was so wholly focused on\nmaking donuts that I forgot to explain why.[VAR 0114(01A5)]
My goal is this:[VAR 0114(01A5)]
To catch a fine Legendary Pokémon for my dear\nmama![VAR 0114(01A5)]
I have some concerns.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Let’s hear her out first.[VAR 0114(000C)]
People truly can’t grasp what they haven’t seen\nfor themselves, I suppose.[VAR 0114(01A5)]
Look there, if you would.[VAR 0114(01A5)]
What IS that? Guhhh, it’s all squirmy![VAR 0114(000C)]
Are my eyes playing tricks, or is there some...other\nplace through there?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Have your donut, Hoopa, and show them what\nyou can do![VAR 0114(01A5)]
Pii hya hya!
Excellent! It opened as planned![VAR 0114(01A5)]
Why did the squirmy spot grow to look like...like\nthe hole in a donut or something?![VAR 0114(000C)]
I’m very pleased with your help, Team MZ.[VAR 0114(01A5)]
As you see, my donuts cause Hoopa to experience\na surge of mysterious power!\c\nWith that power, Hoopa can use a move that will\nlet us travel through this [VAR FF00(0006)]distortion[VAR FF00(0000)]![VAR 0114(01A5)]
And with that, I’m off to catch that fine Legendary\nPokémon. Be back shortly![VAR 0114(01A5)]
What? You’re going IN there?![VAR 0114(000C)]
Who IS this child?![VAR 0114(000B)]
I’ve got a feeling that things in Lumiose are about\nto get weird again![VAR 0114(000C)]
I have MANY concerns![VAR 0114(000B)]
Whatever’s going on, we can’t just leave Ansha in\nthere by herself![VAR 0114(000C)]
R-right! Let’s all follow after her![VAR 0114(000B)]
It’s go time!
Will we be OK?
I have no idea, but we’ve got no choice![VAR 0114(000C)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Yeah! I’ll feel better as long as you’re with us,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(000C)]
[~ 185]
What IS this place?![VAR 0114(000C)]
These buildings look just like the ones in\nLumiose...but the sky isn’t right at all![VAR 0114(000B)]
Wherever we are, we’ve gotta find Ansha!\c\nI have no idea what’s going on, but we can’t leave\na kid in here alone![VAR 0114(000C)]
Should we split up and look for her? What do you\nthink, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(000B)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]\nSplitting up? In some totally unfamiliar place?\c\nMaybe [VAR 0100(0000)] would\nbe\r\nfine,\r\nbut\r\nno\r\nway\r\nam\r\nI\r\ngoing\r\noff\r\nsearching alone![VAR 0114(000C)]
It’s OK! I’m here, too![VAR 0114(0006)]
It’s OK! I’m here, too![VAR 0114(0005)]
It’s settled, then. How shall we pair up?[VAR 0114(000B)]
I’ll go with Lida
[VAR 018B(0001)], go with Naveen
That sounds best. We’ll make two fairly balanced\npairs, skill-wise.[VAR 0114(000B)]
[VAR 018B(0001)] and I will try that direction, then.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Be careful, Naveen![VAR 0114(000C)]
Things OK over there, [VAR 018B(0001)]?[VAR 0114(000C)]
Yeah, we’re fine. Let’s find Ansha, quick![VAR 0114(0006)]
Yeah, we’re fine. Let’s find Ansha, quick![VAR 0114(0005)]
Well, at least our phones still work here. If\nsomething happens, let us know![VAR 0114(000C)]
Let’s look for any sign of Ansha![VAR 0114(000C)]
Are there any people or Pokémon here, you think?[VAR 0114(000C)]
Don’t you think this place looks just like Lumiose?[VAR 0114(000C)]
Even the scaffolding courses are here...[VAR 0114(000C)]
Something’s off about it, but that’s for sure a\nHolovator, right?[VAR 0114(000C)]
An empty Pokémon Center is kind of an eerie\nsight...[VAR 0114(000C)]
[~ 209]
[VAR 0100(0000)]! Look![VAR 0114(000C)]
Hello? We’ve just spotted a Mankey. Have you\nseen any Pokémon where you are?[VAR 0114(000B)]
One’s here too
Yup, same here
So even though this place LOOKS like Lumiose,\nit’s got Pokémon that Lumiose doesn’t...[VAR 0114(000C)]
Ki ki key!
I hope Ansha doesn’t get attacked by any of these\nwild Pokémon...[VAR 0114(000B)]
Looks like it’s gonna be a battle.\c\nWe’ll do our best over here! Good luck, you two![VAR 0114(000C)]
Ki KEY!
[~ 219]
Heeey!!![VAR 0114(0006)]
Hey, everyone![VAR 0114(0005)]
[VAR 018B(0001)]! Naveen! Are you OK?[VAR 0114(000C)]
Those Mankey... They certainly were strong,\nweren’t they?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Pretty strong, yeah
It was so bizarre
Yeah, they were a real handful![VAR 0114(000C)]
Do you think there’s some sort of power floating\naround in here that makes Pokémon stronger?[VAR 0114(0006)]
Do you think there’s some sort of power floating\naround in here that makes Pokémon stronger?[VAR 0114(0005)]
I’m getting more and more worried. We’ve got to\nfind Ansha![VAR 0114(000B)]
Wait, look! Over there![VAR 0114(000C)]
There she goes! After her![VAR 0114(000C)]
Quick, let’s catch up to her![VAR 0114(000C)]
If any more of those Mankey are around, then\nAnsha’s not safe![VAR 0114(000B)]
Let’s just talk to Ansha and find out what the\nheck she’s doing![VAR 0114(0006)]
We need to talk to Ansha and find out what in the\nworld she’s doing![VAR 0114(0005)]
[~ 236]
Why, hello again, Team MZ.[VAR 0114(01A5)]
Unfortunately, the fine Legendary Pokémon I’m\nafter seems to be elsewhere...[VAR 0114(01A5)]
Aw, Ansha, I’m sorry...[VAR 0114(000C)]
Wait, hold that thought! This place is dangerous—\nwe gotta get out of here![VAR 0114(000C)]
Do we? I’m not particularly bothered.[VAR 0114(01A5)]
But if the fine Pokémon I’m after isn’t here, I\nsuppose there’s not much point in staying.[VAR 0114(01A5)]
Why don’t I accompany you back?[VAR 0114(01A5)]
[~ 244]
What a relief to see regular old Lumiose again![VAR 0114(000C)]
Hey, [VAR 0100(0000)]...\c\nI think we ought to let Vinnie know about what’s\nhappened here.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Yeah, good call
I’ll leave it to you, then!
What’s up, Ansha?[VAR 0114(000C)]
Look! Up there![VAR 0114(01A5)]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Text File : main_d_01
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
At least we’ve confirmed that the donuts I make\nhere can indeed get us to that other space.\c\nThank you for your assistance, Team MZ! Your\nreputation is well earned.[VAR 0114(01A5)]
You’re the one who made the donut, Chef Ansha!\c\nBut back up for a second. What WAS that “other\nspace,” besides weird?[VAR 0114(000C)]
I don’t fully understand it myself.[VAR 0114(01A5)]
Then rushing headlong into it was...bold of you.\nReckless, one might say.[VAR 0114(000B)]
I am a girl on a mission, after all![VAR 0114(01A5)]
I simply must catch the fine Pokémon I saw about\nsix months ago in that space![VAR 0114(01A5)]
As cool as that is...it’s still pretty reckless.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Hello, hello, Team MZ. I take it you’re keeping\nyourselves busy as always?[VAR 0114(0013)]
Corbeau?! Hey, did someone borrow money from\nthis guy again?![VAR 0114(000C)]
I can hear you, you know.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Besides, it’s not like any of you would be stupid\nenough to borrow money off the Rust Syndicate.\c\nOnly a real idiot would do that. Oh, I assume\n[VAR 018B(0001)] IS there with you, right?[VAR 0114(0013)]
Now, listen—there’s something important I want\nto discuss. Come over to my office! All of you![VAR 0114(0013)]
He still won’t take “no” for an answer, I see.[VAR 0114(000B)]
If we’ve all got to go, what should we do with\nAnsha?[VAR 0114(000B)]
No need to worry about me. I can remain here\nalone, thank you. I’m quite used to it.[VAR 0114(01A5)]
That’s very mature of you to offer, but would you\nknow what to do if a guest came in?[VAR 0114(000B)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]That’s a big “if.” What do you think,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(000C)]
We should bring Ansha with us
Maybe we should all go together
Yeah... I think you’re right.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Bringing a kid to the Rust Syndicate seems iffy,\nbut I guess she’ll be fine as long as we’re all\r\nthere—especially you, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(000C)]
Right. If [VAR 1100(00FF,0100)]she could help save us all from the tower,\nI’m sure a visit to the Rust Syndicate is no sweat.[VAR 0114(000B)]
You’d be more cautious if you’d ever been inside\nthe Rust Syndicate HQ yourself, Naveen...[VAR 0114(000C)]
You should hurry on to your destination!
[~ 24]
Vinnie? Did you join the Rust Syndicate?![VAR 0114(000C)]
C’mon, use your head. He’s just here to talk\nbusiness.[VAR 0114(0013)]
More importantly, who’s the little lady? New\nTeam MZ member?[VAR 0114(0013)]
She’s a client of ours.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Is that so.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Guess it’s no surprise you big shots would have a\nlot of people asking favors of you now.[VAR 0114(0013)]
People such as me, as it happens.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Here’s the deal.[VAR 0114(0013)]
There’s more weirdness going down in Lumiose,\nand the Rust Syndicate’s been looking into it![VAR 0114(0013)]
While the fine eggheads at Quasartico were\nstudying the impact of that nasty business with\r\nthe tower, they found something else.\c\nTheir instruments picked up some weird readings.\nDifferent than Mega Power.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Ordinarily, Quasartico Inc. would investigate these\nabnormal readings on our own.[VAR 0114(000E)]
But Vinnie and his colleagues have their hands\nfull cleaning up the mess from the tower—plus\r\ngetting Lumiose’s redevelopment back on track.[VAR 0114(0013)]
So, the Rust Syndicate agreed to help them out.\nAfter all, we’ve gotta protect our investments—\r\nI mean, our city.[VAR 0114(0013)]
We started investigating, and then what should\npop up but that bizarre...thing over Centrico Plaza.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Now, I know you Team MZ kiddos get tangled up\nin every little mess that crops up in Lumiose.[VAR 0114(0013)]
So why don’t you go ahead and spill everything\nyou know for us?[VAR 0114(0013)]
Let me make sure I understand correctly.\c\nA donut from Miss Ansha and a move used by\nHoopa allowed you to travel through one of\r\nthese...distortions into a space beyond it?[VAR 0114(000E)]
That mystery space must’ve been where those\nodd readings came from.[VAR 0114(0013)]
I think we can surmise that the move Hoopa used\nis Hyperspace Hole.[VAR 0114(000E)]
Hm. An alternate Lumiose accessed through a\nHyperspace Hole...[VAR 0114(0013)]
Why don’t we just call it [VAR FF00(0006)]Hyperspace Lumiose[VAR FF00(0000)] for\nnow? Simpler than spelling that out every time.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Now let’s get to business!\c\nWe’ve got to learn about Hyperspace Lumiose so\nwe can sort out that distortion over the tower.[VAR 0114(0013)]
And to get into hyperspace, it sounds like we\nneed two things.[VAR 0114(0013)]
The mademoiselle...[VAR 0114(0013)]
and her Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0013)]
What that means for you, kid, is that you’d better\nget used to this little lady being part of the crew.\c\nTeam MZ’s gonna need her if you all intend on\ndiving in and investigating Hyperspace Lumiose.[VAR 0114(0013)]
I’ll get to the bottom of this
You want to involve Ansha?
Not your call, is it? Nor mine. The little lady gets\nto decide for herself whether she’s in or out.[VAR 0114(0013)]
I’d be delighted to learn more about Hyperspace\nLumiose![VAR 0114(01A5)]
That’s the spirit.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Good. Just don’t go putting the mademoiselle in\nany danger. Got it?[VAR 0114(0013)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Consider yourself in charge,\n[VAR 0100(0000)].\r\nYour\r\nnew\r\njob\r\nis\r\nto\r\nsurvey\r\nHyperspace\r\nLumiose![VAR 0114(0013)]
Now, I’m sure scouring the city for distortions\nseems like it’d be a slog...[VAR 0114(0013)]
Which is why I’ve prepared an upgrade for your\nmap app.[VAR 0114(000E)]
You saw how the space for information on that\ndistortion over the tower was totally blank, yeah?[VAR 0114(0013)]
It’s gonna stay that way unless you get going on\nsome good survey work, kid![VAR 0114(0013)]
Some other hyperspace distortions showed up on\nyour map, right? You can start with those.[VAR 0114(0013)]
A word of warning, though: Those things probably\nwon’t sit there waiting for you forever.[VAR 0114(0013)]
What do you mean?
So they disappear?
They seem to phase in and out of existence.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Consider that another quirk of Hyperspace\nLumiose for you to learn more about![VAR 0114(0013)]
As for what else to study, we’ll tell you once you\ngo through a distortion.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Then I shall put my all into making more donuts![VAR 0114(01A5)]
Let us rendezvous back at Hotel Z so I can resume\nmy donut duties, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(01A5)]
We’re clearly just the Rust Syndicate’s pawns\nhere, but this research work certainly bears doing.[VAR 0114(000B)]
What Naveen said. And we oughta look into the\ndistortions for Ansha’s sake too.[VAR 0114(000C)]
These ought to be of some help in your research,\n[VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(000E)]
You’ve got to learn all you can about Hyperspace\nLumiose so everyone in regular-space Lumiose\r\ncan breathe easy![VAR 0114(0013)]
Get out there and show us what you can do![VAR 0114(0013)]
I’ll have Quasartico Inc. get word out to the public\nthat we’re actively investigating these distortions.[VAR 0114(000E)]
Then I guess we’d better get busy ordering up\nsome more donuts from Chef Ansha![VAR 0114(000C)]
Yup, you’d better. If anything else comes up, I’ll\nbe in touch.[VAR 0114(0013)]
My kitchen awaits—see you there![VAR 0114(01A5)]
What are you doing back here? Get some donuts\nfrying so you can check out Hyperspace Lumiose![VAR 0114(0013)]
I trust Team MZ will once again live up to its\nhelpful reputation.[VAR 0114(0014)]
I sincerely hope these hyperspace distortions\ndon’t cause too great an uproar...[VAR 0114(000E)]
[~ 83]
Wow, Chef Ansha! You make a mean donut![VAR 0114(000C)]
Getting into the donut business? Guess you have\nto make your hotel stand out somehow.[VAR 0114(0007)]
Oho! Never mind the donuts—we’ve got a rare\nPokémon here![VAR 0114(0007)]
Pii hya?
Looks like Hoopa, the Mischief Pokémon.\c\nI’ve heard its mysterious loops can warp space\nitself.[VAR 0114(0007)]
But let’s all hold that thought.[VAR 0114(0007)]
[VAR 0100(0000)]! You saw some Mankey?![VAR 0114(0007)]
I know they don’t live in Lumiose! So when I saw\nyou’d registered one, I went poking around.[VAR 0114(0007)]
People are chattering away online about all this\nhyperspace stuff, and I had a hunch that it was\r\nconnected to your Mankey sighting.[VAR 0114(0007)]
I bet I could get all kinds of fascinating data from\nPokémon in hyperspace! You’ve got to get on it![VAR 0114(0007)]
Though...maybe I do feel a little bad about piling\nmore work on you. A little.[VAR 0114(0007)]
Anyway, the real point of my visit is...I’ve powered\nup your Pokédex![VAR 0114(0007)]
Your Pokédex has been updated! Now you can\ncheck the Hyperspace Pokédex!
Bet you can’t wait to dive back in and get your\nhands dirty in hyperspace now! Happy digging![VAR 0114(0007)]
May I ask who that...lively woman was?[VAR 0114(01A5)]
Mable is the acting director of the Pokémon\nResearch Lab. She gets us to do her research.\c\nShe’s rather remarkable, but, well...don’t worry\nabout her.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Getting back on topic!\c\nThe next step to investigate Hyperspace Lumiose\nwould be to check out one of those distortions.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Quite right! And I’ll stand by to prepare more\ninvestigatory aid in donut form.[VAR 0114(01A5)]
The Rust Syndicate office makes me so nervous...[VAR 0114(000C)]
It was so eerie inside that otherworldly space...[VAR 0114(000B)]
I’ll go wherever I must to accomplish my goal![VAR 0114(01A5)]
Pii hyaaa!
Kyururu.
[~ 107]
It’s a hyperspace distortion. Better have Ansha\nmake a donut for you!
It’s a hyperspace distortion.\c\nWill you feed Hoopa a donut and open a portal to\nHyperspace Lumiose?
Open sesame, Hoopa!
Maybe in a little bit
[~ 112]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Hello, [VAR 0100(0000)]? It appears\nyou’ve\r\nmade\r\nit\r\ninto\r\nHyperspace\r\nLumiose.[VAR 0114(0014)]
I’ll put Mr. Corbeau on the phone.[VAR 0114(0014)]
Hey. Got yourself sorted on the donut front, did\nyou? Don’t forget to thank Ansha and Hoopa.[VAR 0114(0013)]
And now that you’re all set, allow me to formally\nsend you a [VAR FF00(0006)]hyperspace survey request[VAR FF00(0000)] with some\r\ntasks to accomplish while you’re in there.[VAR 0114(0013)]
They’ll make it easier to keep track of what you\nhave to do in Hyperspace Lumiose.[VAR 0114(0013)]
It’d be a huge help if you could accumulate 7,000\npoints or so. That’ll move our research forward.[VAR 0114(0013)]
You’ll probably have to visit Hyperspace Lumiose\na few times to get enough points.[VAR 0114(0013)]
So, yeah. Good luck out there, eh?[VAR 0114(0013)]
Ready to escape from Hyperspace Lumiose?
Let me out of here!
I’ll stay here longer
Do you want to forfeit this battle and get out of\nHyperspace Lumiose?
If you need Berries, you can always buy some at a\nfood stall! There’s one near Wild Zone 8, right?[VAR 0114(000C)]
It seems Ansha will make as many donuts for\nyour Hyperspace Lumiose surveys as you like.[VAR 0114(000B)]
[~ 127]
Fine work out there.[VAR 0114(0014)]
You’ve accumulated enough points to advance\nour research.[VAR 0114(0014)]
You have our gratitude.[VAR 0114(0014)]
Please come to Mr. Corbeau’s office so we can\ndiscuss our next steps.[VAR 0114(0014)]
We’ll see you here soon.[VAR 0114(0014)]
[~ 133]
Hey! You too?\c\nCorbeau called me in just when I thought I was\nall done helping folks out for the day.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Hey! You too?\c\nCorbeau called me in just when I thought I was\nall done helping people out for today.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Good, you’re both here.[VAR 0114(0013)]
All right, Vinnie. Tell us what you’ve learned,\nwould you?[VAR 0114(0013)]
Certainly.[VAR 0114(000E)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Thanks to [VAR 0100(0000)]’s\ninvestigation,\r\nwe’ve\r\nascertained\r\nthe\r\nfollowing.[VAR 0114(000E)]
First, there is a possibility that Hyperspace\nLumiose could affect the real Lumiose.[VAR 0114(000E)]
To be specific, Pokémon observed in hyperspace\nmight eventually reach this world as well.[VAR 0114(000E)]
Guess this city’s a tourist attraction even for\nPokémon.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Our second finding is that certain areas within\nHyperspace Lumiose appear to contain Pokémon\r\nat risk of Rogue Mega Evolution.[VAR 0114(000E)]
Rogue Mega Evolution?![VAR 0114(0006)]
Rogue Mega Evolution?![VAR 0114(0005)]
That’s not good. The Pokémon in Hyperspace\nLumiose are weirdly tough already.\c\nIf they Rogue Mega Evolve, they might be too\nmuch for me and [VAR 0100(0000)] alone.[VAR 0114(0006)]
That’s not good. The Pokémon in Hyperspace\nLumiose are bizarrely tough already.\c\nIf they Rogue Mega Evolve, they might be too\nmuch for me and [VAR 0100(0000)] alone.[VAR 0114(0005)]
You got that right. Those hyperspace Pokémon are\nhyper strong.\c\nProblem is, Hyperspace Lumiose apparently gets\nunstable if too many folks head inside together.\c\nFour people at once seems to be the point where\nthings start going sideways. So three’s the limit.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Which gave me an idea...\c\nWhat if we sent you in with a Trainer good\nenough to cover for both Lida and Naveen?[VAR 0114(0013)]
Someone on our level? We’re the Z-A Royale’s top\ntwo Trainers, so they’d have to be really strong...[VAR 0114(0006)]
Someone on our level? We’re the Z-A Royale’s top\ntwo Trainers, so they’d have to be really strong...[VAR 0114(0005)]
There’s a perfect Trainer waiting in the wings.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Is it Canari?
Ivor’s very strong...
Jacinthe, maybe?
Do you mean yourself?
I bet it’s Grisham
Pfft—as if. She’d just mess around and start\nlivestreaming a reaction video or something.[VAR 0114(0013)]
You’ve got a point, but you know full well getting\nhim to understand the situation would be a pain.[VAR 0114(0013)]
If anything, I think we’d be better off keeping her\nquarantined in one of her Jacinthe zones.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Ha! I’d be up for it, but you couldn’t afford my\nservices.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Ah, Grisham... He’s tricky. Very strong, but you\nnever can quite tell what he’s thinking.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Enough guessing. Let me introduce your new\npartner![VAR 0114(0013)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Hey there! You must be\n[VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0004)]
I’m Korrina, the successor to a line of Mega\nEvolution gurus![VAR 0114(0192)]
And I wanna test your skills right here, right now![VAR 0114(0192)]
Feel free to use my battle court. It’s had the honor\nof hosting many a ferocious showdown.[VAR 0114(0013)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]\nWe’ll do it proud, Corbeau!\c\nC’mon, [VAR 0100(0000)]. Show me\nyour stuff![VAR 0114(0192)]
How come she’s challenging just you? I wanna\nbattle too![VAR 0114(0006)]
Why’s she testing your skills and not mine?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Well, since I’m here, I might as well watch too.\nNot every day you get to see a battle like this.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Mr. Corbeau has kindly allowed you the use of his\noffice’s private battle court. Get going.[VAR 0114(0014)]
I look forward to seeing a fine battle from you.[VAR 0114(000E)]
[~ 174]
So! I hear you’re the Trainer who got Zygarde to\nMega Evolve and saved Lumiose.[VAR 0114(0192)]
I wanna see your skills for myself...and what\nbetter way than through a Pokémon battle?[VAR 0114(0192)]
I’ve got one special request, if you’ll humor me![VAR 0114(0192)]
I want you to show me what Mega Evolution\nmeans for you and your Pokémon![VAR 0114(0192)]
So with that...[VAR 0114(0192)]
Let’s roll![VAR 0114(0192)]
[~ 181]
Don’t forget—you’ve gotta show me how you and\nyour Pokémon use Mega Evolution![VAR 0114(0192)]
Let’s give it all we’ve got![VAR 0114(0192)]
[~ 184]
Huh. You sure you’re the one who saved\nLumiose?[VAR 0114(0192)]
[~ 186]
Wow, you didn’t even need Mega Evolution to\nbeat me...\c\nBut I won’t have a real sense of your skills until\nyou show me your Mega Evolution![VAR 0114(0192)]
You need to Mega Evolve one of your Pokémon\nduring your battle with Korrina!
[~ 189]
Haha! You ARE something special![VAR 0114(0192)]
I’m glad I saw your Mega Evolution. It showed me\nwho you are—kind and straightforward![VAR 0114(0192)]
Mega Evolution brings out a Pokémon’s latent\nstrength.[VAR 0114(0192)]
But too much power can take its toll on a\nPokémon. The most obvious example of that\r\nhas gotta be Rogue Mega Evolution.[VAR 0114(0192)]
As the Mega Evolution successor, I wanna help\nyou two! Let’s save these poor Pokémon from\r\nhaving to suffer Rogue Mega Evolution![VAR 0114(0192)]
See how good she is? With Korrina on your team,\nyou’ll be set.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Thanks for recruiting her, Corbeau![VAR 0114(0006)]
Thanks for recruiting her, Corbeau![VAR 0114(0005)]
Eh, you three were probably fated to meet sooner\nor later. Just happened to be me who caused it.[VAR 0114(0013)]
One last thing—Vinnie and I discussed your\nsurvey work, and we’ve got one more request.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Whenever you encounter a Rogue Mega-Evolved\nPokémon in hyperspace...catch it.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Vinnie also mentioned you’ll want to gather any\nHyperspace Berries you come across.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Already on it
What’re those?
Should’ve figured you’d be ahead of the game![VAR 0114(0013)]
[VAR FF00(0006)]Hyperspace Berries[VAR FF00(0000)] are what we’re calling the\nspecial Berries found in Hyperspace Lumiose.[VAR 0114(0013)]
If you give Hoopa donuts made with lots of\nHyperspace Berries, it should power you up\r\nenough to go toe-to-toe with Rogue Pokémon![VAR 0114(0013)]
I just so happen to have a couple such Berries on\nme. Here, take one.[VAR 0114(0013)]
And what about me? What should I be doing?[VAR 0114(0192)]
Looks like there’s a distortion in [VAR FF00(0006)]Rouge Sector 1[VAR FF00(0000)]\nthat’s got all the signs of Rogue Mega Evolution.\r\nWe could enter Hyperspace Lumiose from there![VAR 0114(0006)]
Looks like there’s a distortion in [VAR FF00(0006)]Rouge Sector 1[VAR FF00(0000)]\nthat’s got all the signs of Rogue Mega Evolution.\r\nWe could enter Hyperspace Lumiose from there![VAR 0114(0005)]
Roger that. Then I’ll see you in Rouge Sector 1![VAR 0114(0192)]
There you have it, kid. You know what to do.[VAR 0114(0013)]
We fervently hope for your success.[VAR 0114(0014)]
Once again, Lumiose’s safety falls to you.[VAR 0114(000E)]
[~ 215]
Hyperspace distortions sure are weird. I kinda\nwanna poke this thing just to see what happens.[VAR 0114(0192)]
I bet there’d be a panic over these if Quasartico\nhadn’t told everyone they’re looking into ’em.[VAR 0114(0192)]
An overwhelming swell of Mega Power has been\ndetected within Hyperspace Lumiose!\c\nA Pokémon inside must be about to Rogue Mega\nEvolve! Will you enter and calm it?
I’m ready for battle!
I need to prepare
Hang on, Korrina! I’m coming too![VAR 0114(0006)]
Wait! I’m going with you![VAR 0114(0005)]
Oops, sorry!\c\nI was so pumped to see what Pokémon’s gonna\nRogue Mega Evolve, I forgot about you![VAR 0114(0192)]
Anyway, now that all three of us are good and\nready...Hyperspace Lumiose, here we come![VAR 0114(0192)]
Do your thing, Hoopa![VAR 0114(0192)]
Wait. You need a donut or else we can’t get\nthrough to Hyperspace Lumiose, right?[VAR 0114(0192)]
Oh—wait one sec, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nWe’ve gotta catch the Rogue Pokémon in there,\nso make sure you’ve got room in your Boxes![VAR 0114(0192)]
[~ 228]
So, that Absol’s about to Rogue Mega Evolve![VAR 0114(0192)]
Y’know what happens to Absol when it Mega\nEvolves?[VAR 0114(0192)]
Its Sp. Atk stat goes up
Its Speed stat goes up
[VAR BD06(0000)]\nYou know your stuff!\c\nI forgot—you’ve battled a Rogue Mega Absol\nbefore, right, [VAR 0100(0000)]?\r\nAZ told me![VAR 0114(0192)]
We’ve got a Trainer who’s battled a Rogue Mega\nAbsol before AND Korrina, the Mega Evolution\r\nsuccessor. We can handle this Rogue Pokémon![VAR 0114(0006)]
We’ve got a Trainer who’s battled a Rogue Mega\nAbsol before AND Korrina, the Mega Evolution\r\nsuccessor. We can handle this Rogue Pokémon![VAR 0114(0005)]
If we all battle hard, I’m sure we can take care of\nthis Absol![VAR 0114(0006)]
If we all battle hard, I’m sure we can take care of\nthis Absol![VAR 0114(0005)]
[~ 238]
The concentration of Mega Power in your vicinity\nis rising rapidly!\c\nWarning: Rogue Mega Evolution is imminent!
I’m ready to handle it!
I need to prepare
You need to catch Mega Absol Z!
A Mega Absol Z... I can’t believe it![VAR 0114(0192)]
Another Absol suffering from Rogue Mega\nEvolution... What a strange twist of fate.[VAR 0114(0192)]
No matter what Mega Evolution we’re up against,\nif it’s Rogue Mega Evolved, we’ve gotta help it![VAR 0114(0006)]
No matter what Mega Evolution we’re up against,\nif it’s Rogue Mega Evolved, we’ve gotta help it![VAR 0114(0005)]
C’mon! Now that we’ve calmed Absol, you’ve\ngotta catch it![VAR 0114(0192)]
[~ 248]
You need to catch the Absol you calmed!
Whoa! Do you always get a Mega Stone after you\ncalm a Rogue Pokémon?[VAR 0114(0192)]
That must be the Pokémon saying thanks for\nfreeing it from the pain of Rogue Mega Evolution![VAR 0114(0192)]
Seeing it happen up close was really something.[VAR 0114(0192)]
I could feel the danger—especially since it was\nextra strong from being in Hyperspace Lumiose...[VAR 0114(0192)]
Korrina, you said that was Mega Absol...Z?[VAR 0114(0006)]
Korrina, you said that was Mega Absol...Z?[VAR 0114(0005)]
It sure was! I was shocked![VAR 0114(0192)]
That’s surprising coming from the Mega\nEvolution successor...[VAR 0114(0006)]
Aren’t you supposed to be this “Mega Evolution\nsuccessor” or whatever?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Hey! Mega Absol Z was only discovered recently!\nI didn’t think we’d run into one right away.[VAR 0114(0192)]
Sure.\c\nIn any case, it’s good to know the three of us can\nhandle pretty much any Rogue Mega Evolution.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Sure.\c\nIn any case, it’s good to know the three of us can\nhandle pretty much any Rogue Mega Evolution.[VAR 0114(0005)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Yeah! [VAR 0100(0000)] and [VAR 018B(0001)],\nyou\r\ntwo\r\nare\r\nfantastic\r\nTrainers!\c\nI’m not surprised Team MZ managed to pull\nLumiose out of crisis mode.[VAR 0114(0192)]
I think I can learn even more about Mega\nEvolution by helping with your surveys.\c\nAnd the more I know, the deeper the bonds I can\nbuild with my Pokémon![VAR 0114(0192)]
Hey there. Good work—our instruments stopped\npicking up those Rogue Mega Evolution readings.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Thanks for your help too, Ms. Mega Stones.\c\nTaking down a Rogue Mega Evolution alongside\nthe Team MZ crew is pretty big. Guess you really\r\ndeserve that “Mega Evolution successor” title.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Your efforts got us some valuable data, too. We’ll\nget to work analyzing it.\c\nTomorrow we should have more to tell you. For\ntoday, hit the bricks and get some rest.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Sounds good to me. I could sure use a br—[VAR 0114(0192)]
Uh, what’s that?[VAR 0114(0192)]
A big...golden...Poké Ball?![VAR 0114(0006)]
That’s...that’s a big golden Poké Ball, right?[VAR 0114(0005)]
I wonder if a Pokémon’s gonna leap out of it...\c\nWanna try hitting it with a move just in case,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0192)]
First a Rogue Mega-Evolved Pokémon, then a\ngiant Poké Ball thing... This place is nuts.[VAR 0114(0006)]
First a Rogue Mega-Evolved Pokémon, then a\ngiant Poké Ball thing... This place is nuts.[VAR 0114(0005)]
[~ 274]
The Poké Ball contained lots of Berries!
It also contained what seems to be...butter?!
You obtained a pack of [VAR FF00(0008)]Nice Butter[VAR FF00(0000)]!
Well, I sure didn’t expect to find butter here, but it\nlooks like quality stuff!\c\nI’d go so far as to call it Nice Butter![VAR 0114(0006)]
Well, I sure didn’t expect to find butter here, but it\nlooks like quality stuff!\c\nI’d go so far as to call it Nice Butter![VAR 0114(0005)]
Mmm, it even smells high-quality. Let’s show\nAnsha! I bet it’ll be great for her donuts.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Mmm, it even smells high-quality. Let’s show\nAnsha! I bet it’ll be great for her donuts.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Good idea! I think it’s time to head back to your\nhome base at Hotel Z anyway.[VAR 0114(0192)]
[~ 283]
Wow. Been a while since I stepped in here...[VAR 0114(0192)]
Pardon me. Might you be a guest?[VAR 0114(000B)]
This is Korrina—Team MZ’s latest star helper![VAR 0114(0006)]
This is Korrina—Team MZ’s latest star helper![VAR 0114(0005)]
Ah, beg your pardon—and thanks for your help.\nI’m Naveen.[VAR 0114(000B)]
I’m Lida! Good to meet you, Korrina![VAR 0114(000C)]
And my name is Ansha.\c\nHoopa and I have the honor of lending Team MZ\nour services.[VAR 0114(01A5)]
Pii hya hya!
Super thrilled to meet you all! Like [VAR 1100(00FF,0606)]TaunieUrbain said,\nmy name’s Korrina![VAR 0114(0192)]
Now that the introductions are out of the way...\nWe brought back something nice, Ansha![VAR 0114(0006)]
Now that the introductions are out of the way...\nWe brought back something nice, Ansha![VAR 0114(0005)]
Show her, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0006)]
Show her, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0005)]
You showed Ansha the Nice Butter!
Is there a story behind this butter?[VAR 0114(01A5)]
It turned up after we calmed the Rogue Pokémon\nin Hyperspace Lumiose.\c\nY’know, it’s weird how nothing in there is real but\nthe Pokémon and the items we find.[VAR 0114(0192)]
Fascinating! If you don’t mind, I shall borrow\nsome to produce ever more and finer donuts.[VAR 0114(01A5)]
Now, I think Korrina needs a welcome party! I’ll\nget some food going.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Now, I think Korrina needs a welcome party! I’ll\nget some food going.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Excuse me, Korrina? Did you say you’ve been to\nHotel Z before?[VAR 0114(000C)]
Sure have![VAR 0114(0192)]
AZ and I went way back.[VAR 0114(0192)]
Once he started having trouble battling for\nhimself, I entrusted him with my Lucario to help.[VAR 0114(0192)]
That Lucario helped me out
He left that Lucario to me
AZ told me how my Lucario helped you calm that\nfirst Mega Absol. He seemed happy![VAR 0114(0192)]
So is your connection to AZ what brought you to\nLumiose?[VAR 0114(0006)]
Does AZ have something to do with why you\ncame to Lumiose, then?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Yep. I’m here for two reasons...\c\nTo pay my respects at AZ’s grave and help put a\nstop to Rogue Mega Evolution![VAR 0114(0192)]
Getting to try this special curry is a bonus![VAR 0114(0192)]
I had the honor of being sous-chef![VAR 0114(01A5)]
Ordinarily, I’d treat you to one of my signature\ndonuts, but dinner took precedence.[VAR 0114(01A5)]
Well, I can’t wait to try one of your donuts soon,\nAnsha![VAR 0114(0192)]
So now that I’ve met everyone in Team MZ, I’ve\ngot a big favor to ask.\c\nWhich is...to please let me stay here with you all\nwhile we get this mission done![VAR 0114(0192)]
No objections here! That’ll make it easier for us to\ncoordinate.[VAR 0114(0006)]
No objections here! That’ll make it easier for us to\ncoordinate.[VAR 0114(0005)]
I’ll set you up with a room once dinner’s done![VAR 0114(000C)]
Oh, has someone else taken room 301 now?[VAR 0114(0192)]
That’s YOUR room?! I wondered why it was\nalways locked![VAR 0114(0006)]
That’s YOUR room?! I wondered why it was\nalways locked![VAR 0114(0005)]
Yup, it’s mine![VAR 0114(0192)]
Looking forward to being hotelmates with you all![VAR 0114(0192)]
[~ 326]
Hey, AZ. I made it back.[VAR 0114(0192)]
I know I was too late to stop things from going\nwrong with the tower...\c\nBut this time I’ll help however I can![VAR 0114(0192)]
We can’t let those poor Pokémon in Hyperspace\nLumiose keep Rogue Mega Evolving.[VAR 0114(0192)]
I’ll handle—\c\nNo, I won’t just handle them...[VAR 0114(0192)]
I’ll save them from any more suffering![VAR 0114(0192)]

The next day...
Your alarm is going off...
[~ 2]
Ah, that old room of mine is the best! Felt like AZ\nwas still here, welcoming me back.[VAR 0114(0192)]
The hotel where I reside is so decadent that I can\nnever quite feel relaxed there.[VAR 0114(01A5)]
I’m not surprised you got set up in a plush spot.\nYou come from one fancy family, Ansha![VAR 0114(0192)]
It seems that way. Both her coat and her apron\nare bespoke, if I’m not mistaken.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Y’know, in all this craziness, I forgot to ask...\c\nIs it really OK for you to hang out here with us all\nthe time, Ansha?[VAR 0114(000C)]
Of course! My donut shop is here, after all![VAR 0114(01A5)]
Well, sure, but I think Lida’s still got a point.[VAR 0114(0192)]
Don’t you need to let the folks back at your hotel\nknow about your donut shop and everything?[VAR 0114(0192)]
Not to worry! I’ve been returning to my hotel at\nbedtime.[VAR 0114(01A5)]
A customer? Welcome![VAR 0114(01A5)]
What do your senses tell you, Chandelure?[VAR 0114(0012)]
Shaaa!
A donut shop?!\c\nI’d better report back![VAR 0114(0012)]
Target acquired...in Hotel Z.[VAR 0114(0012)]
Can we help you with something, Gwynn?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Not another word, fake Canatic.[VAR 0114(0012)]
TEAM MZ!!![VAR 0114(0016)]
Looks like we’ve got some strong Trainers here!\nYou gonna battle her? Should we both battle ’em?[VAR 0114(0192)]
No, Korrina, wait! Don’t provoke her![VAR 0114(000C)]
I’m not here to battle! I’ve got real serious\nbusiness![VAR 0114(0016)]
Will you be needing a room?
So, no battles today?
NO! No battles, and no rooms![VAR 0114(0016)]
All right, Lebanne, we hear you. Perhaps we could\ndiscuss this a little more calmly?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Calm? CALM?! There’s no time for calm![VAR 0114(0016)]
At this rate, I’m riskin’ the wrath of Lady Jacinthe,\nand it’s NOT gonna be pretty![VAR 0114(0016)]
I think you’ll be able to explain the situation\nbetter if you take a deep breath.[VAR 0114(000B)]
*sigh*\c\nOK.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Lady Jacinthe has a close friend, whom she\ndeeply respects and admires.\c\nThe daughter of that friend has been staying at\nHotel Richissime.[VAR 0114(0016)]
I was tasked with acting both as bodyguard and\nbabysitter during her stay...but now she’s GONE![VAR 0114(0016)]
MISS ANSHAAA![VAR 0114(0016)]
Where are youuu?![VAR 0114(0016)]
Here. Like I said.[VAR 0114(0012)]
Our mission is complete. I’m leaving now.[VAR 0114(0012)]
OH NO, YOU’RE NOT![VAR 0114(0016)]
I’ve been so worried about Miss Ansha and what\nLady Jacinthe might do to punish my oversight...\c\nNow I’m so stressed, I...I can’t even see straight![VAR 0114(0016)]
I need a Pokémon battle to calm down, but I can’t\nwin on my own with my blood pounding like this![VAR 0114(0016)]
I don’t see what you expect me to do about that.[VAR 0114(0012)]
C’mon—two on two, us versus them! I need you\non my team so I don’t go off the rails!\c\n[VAR 0100(0000)], pick a teammate![VAR 0114(0016)]
Me and Gwynn are gonna team up for this one![VAR 0114(0016)]
You’re irritating me in a somewhat Ivor-ish way.[VAR 0114(0012)]
But I’ll play along if I get to trounce the fake\nCanatic.[VAR 0114(0012)]
Now I’m being dragged into this? Why?[VAR 0114(000B)]
C’mon, Naveen! You want to help Lebanne settle\ndown, right? Go get ’em![VAR 0114(000C)]
Fine, fine. I’ll see you all outside.[VAR 0114(000B)]
[~ 48]
Now that you’ve got that Absolite Z, I’ve got an\nimportant tip for you, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0192)]
Mega-Evolved Pokémon classified with “Z” have\nspecial characteristics![VAR 0114(0192)]
If you wanna try out Z Mega Evolution, have your\nAbsol hold that Absolite Z stone.[VAR 0114(0192)]
You could even test it against Lebanne and\nGwynn right now![VAR 0114(0192)]
[~ 53]
LET’S GOOO!!![VAR 0114(0016)]
Are we doing this?[VAR 0114(0012)]
Yes, let’s!
Let’s not
If you won’t battle, I’d like to leave...[VAR 0114(0012)]
I’m going to win...so I can leave and get some\npeace![VAR 0114(0012)]
Hey, where are you going? The thrills, chills, and\nspills of battling await![VAR 0114(0192)]
This Lebanne seems like a real formidable Trainer![VAR 0114(0192)]
Lebanne has a constant headache from Jacinthe,\nand Gwynn from Ivor. They’re sisters in suffering.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Why did I get targeted simply for being a fan of\nCanari?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Ms. Lebanne hasn’t noticed I’m here, has she?[VAR 0114(01A5)]
Pii hya?
Kyururu.
I’m getting more and more riled up! We gotta\nbattle, quick![VAR 0114(0016)]
Lebanne and Gwynn make quite a team, huh?\nOne hotheaded, one ice-cold.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Lebanne and Gwynn make quite a team, huh?\nOne hotheaded, one ice-cold.[VAR 0114(0005)]
[~ 70]
In this battle, I’ll prove to myself that I’ve got the\nstrength to protect Miss Ansha![VAR 0114(0016)]
[~ 72]
Time for our secret weapon! Mega Evolve so we\ncan drag these kids, Dragalge![VAR 0114(0016)]
Chandelure... Mega Evolve. Finish them.[VAR 0114(0012)]
[~ 75]
Having another Trainer at your side makes it much\neasier to keep a cool head in battle.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Our victory is all thanks to Gwynn.[VAR 0114(0016)]
But we still lost... My apologies, Gwynn. I take full\nresponsibility.[VAR 0114(0016)]
I’m just happy I got to team up with someone\nother than Ivor.[VAR 0114(0012)]
Now, back to the matter at hand.[VAR 0114(0016)]
I came here because I need to find Miss Ansha.[VAR 0114(0016)]
As I said, Lady Jacinthe cares a great deal for her.[VAR 0114(0016)]
If something were to happen to Miss Ansha, I\nshudder to think of the consequences...[VAR 0114(0016)]
I don’t care what happens to me—\c\nWell, no, I do care what happens to me. But I care\nmore about my duty as her bodyguard.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Um, so... Ansha’s been here the entire time.\nGwynn tried to tell you.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Hello.[VAR 0114(01A5)]
Wha—?[VAR 0114(0016)]
I told you.[VAR 0114(0012)]
O-oh. Got it.\c\nMy blood must have really been pounding in my\nhead...[VAR 0114(0016)]
Well, what matters is that Miss Ansha is safe.\nThank goodness for that![VAR 0114(0016)]
At least I can rest easy knowing she’s in the\ncapable hands of Team MZ.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Will Jacinthe be all right with that, do you think?[VAR 0114(000B)]
That is the question.[VAR 0114(0016)]
I’m sure Lady Jacinthe would prefer to have Miss\nAnsha at Hotel Richissime...\c\nBut Lady Jacinthe can be quite overprotective.\nAnd I’m sure Miss Ansha would feel cooped up.[VAR 0114(0016)]
I cannot abandon my donuts! I’ve got to keep\nworking on them—my dream depends on it![VAR 0114(01A5)]
Very well, then![VAR 0114(0016)]
Miss Ansha, feel free to remain here.\c\nIf anyone asks, I’ll tell them you’re still in your\nroom at Hotel Richissime.[VAR 0114(0016)]
However, I must insist that this matter be kept\nsecret from Lady Jacinthe.[VAR 0114(0016)]
If she finds out, it’ll be YOUR heads on the\nchopping block, Team MZ![VAR 0114(0016)]
I’ll take my leave. Best of luck—and work hard at\nyour donutcraft, Miss Ansha.[VAR 0114(0016)]
All right, time to head back![VAR 0114(0016)]
I’m impressed, Lebanne. That was very\nconsiderate of you.[VAR 0114(0012)]
You’re too easily impressed. We’re not all like Ivor,\nyou know.[VAR 0114(0016)]
We’d better not let Jacinthe find out about this,\nor she’ll shut Ansha in a Jacinthe zone![VAR 0114(000C)]
[VAR 0100(0000)].\c\nI need you, that team leader of yours, and\nMs. Mega Stones to come to my office.[VAR 0114(0013)]
I overheard. Let’s go!\c\nHopefully this means they’ve figured out\nsomething new to tell us![VAR 0114(0192)]
Our hotel is remarkably busy for how few guests\nwe have.[VAR 0114(000B)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Guess we’ll see ya later,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(000C)]
What is it with the Rust Syndicate calling us to\ntheir office? Can’t they talk on the phone?[VAR 0114(000C)]
Don’t worry. We’ll take care of the hotel.[VAR 0114(000B)]
I’ll busy myself practicing my donut techniques![VAR 0114(01A5)]
Pii hya.
You should hurry on to your destination!
[~ 114]
There you are, my busy crew![VAR 0114(0013)]
Sorry to make you haul yourselves here every time\nwe need to have a meeting.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Afraid we can’t really help it, though.\c\nFolks seem to get spooked whenever they see me\nand Philippe roaming the streets.[VAR 0114(0013)]
And holo-calls wear me down, you know? They\ndon’t have the warmth of a face-to-face chat.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Anyway! Down to business.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Our research into Hyperspace Lumiose is coming\nalong, thanks to you all.[VAR 0114(0013)]
We’re still in the dark when it comes to that\ndistortion hanging out over the tower.[VAR 0114(0013)]
But, well, we managed to stumble onto a rather\ntroubling discovery.[VAR 0114(0013)]
How troubling?
What is it?
It seems more of these pockets of hyperspace are\nappearing as time goes on...and they’re beginning\r\nto affect our world too.[VAR 0114(0013)]
We’ve started getting reports that Pokémon from\nHyperspace Lumiose have been showing up here\r\nin regular-space Lumiose.[VAR 0114(0013)]
If we’re talking worst-case scenario...Hyperspace\nLumiose could eventually swallow the whole city.[VAR 0114(0013)]
We can’t let that happen!
C’mon, seriously?
We sure can’t.[VAR 0114(0013)]
You’ve seen Lumiose in crisis once already. You\nsure you wanna be so dismissive of this?[VAR 0114(0013)]
Luckily, it’s not all bad news.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Thanks to your research, we can now detect\nhyperspace distortions that we couldn’t before![VAR 0114(0013)]
Be warned, however—the parts of Hyperspace\nLumiose beyond these distortions likely hold even\r\nstronger Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0014)]
Bring ’em on! With the three of us working\ntogether, we can handle anything![VAR 0114(0192)]
Let’s go scour different parts of Hyperspace\nLumiose for Berries and other ingredients!\c\nWe’ve gotta order up plenty of donuts from Chef\nAnsha![VAR 0114(0192)]
These ought to be of some help in your research,\n[VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(000E)]
Sounds like you know what to do. Get to it![VAR 0114(0013)]
There’s plenty of hyperspace to survey.[VAR 0114(0014)]
We’re grateful to be able to depend on you.[VAR 0114(000E)]
[~ 141]
Fine work out there.[VAR 0114(0014)]
You’ve accumulated enough points to advance\nour research.[VAR 0114(0014)]
There’s also a particular hyperspace distortion we\nask that you look into. I’ve marked it on your map.[VAR 0114(0014)]
Best of luck.[VAR 0114(0014)]
[~ 146]
It looks like there’s a Pokémon in danger of\nRogue Mega Evolving through here.[VAR 0114(0192)]
An overwhelming swell of Mega Power has been\ndetected within Hyperspace Lumiose!\c\nA Pokémon inside must be about to Rogue Mega\nEvolve! Will you enter and calm it?
I’m going in now!
I need to prepare
Hey, don’t forget about me![VAR 0114(0006)]
Hey, don’t forget about me![VAR 0114(0005)]
There’s no forgetting someone like you, [VAR 018B(0001)].[VAR 0114(0192)]
We need a donut to get into Hyperspace Lumiose,\ndon’t we?[VAR 0114(0192)]
Oh—wait one sec, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nWe’ve gotta catch the Rogue Pokémon in there,\nso make sure you’ve got room in your Boxes![VAR 0114(0192)]
[~ 156]
Something’s been bothering me.\c\nTeam MZ stopped the tower when it went wild,\nand the tower was the cause of Rogue Mega\r\nEvolution, right?\c\nSo why are Pokémon in Hyperspace Lumiose still\nRogue Mega Evolving?[VAR 0114(0192)]
Maybe it’s a ripple effect from all the Mega Power\nthat overflowed when the tower went nuts.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Maybe it’s a ripple effect from all the Mega Power\nthat overflowed when the tower went nuts.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Hm. Well, looks like our opponent here will be...a\nStaraptor.[VAR 0114(0192)]
Staraptor becomes a Flying- and Fighting-type\nPokémon once it Mega Evolves! Electric types\r\nwill come in handy, if you’ve got any![VAR 0114(0192)]
[~ 162]
The concentration of Mega Power in your vicinity\nis rising rapidly!\c\nWarning: Rogue Mega Evolution is imminent!
I’m ready to handle it!
I need to prepare
In battle, you gotta watch your opponent’s\nmovements closely![VAR 0114(0192)]
Don’t forget—Flying-type Pokémon are weak to\nElectric-type moves.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Don’t forget—Flying-type Pokémon are weak to\nElectric-type moves.[VAR 0114(0005)]
[~ 169]
You need to catch the Staraptor you calmed!
Wow... Mega Staraptor nearly kicked our butts![VAR 0114(0192)]
I can’t believe how much stronger even Rogue\nPokémon are in Hyperspace Lumiose![VAR 0114(0006)]
I can’t believe how much stronger even Rogue\nPokémon are in Hyperspace Lumiose![VAR 0114(0005)]
Hey, you three.\c\nWe saw the Rogue Mega Evolution readings\ndisappear. Good work over there.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Go ahead and call it a day. We’ll get to work\nanalyzing the data we got.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Ah, the telltale golden gleam of another giant\nPoké Ball![VAR 0114(0192)]
Better break it open with a move! I have a feeling I\nknow what we’ll find.[VAR 0114(0006)]
I think I know what’s in it...but you’d better crack\nit open with a move and find out![VAR 0114(0005)]
[~ 179]
The Poké Ball contained lots of Berries!
It also contained what seems to be some butter!
You obtained a pack of [VAR FF00(0008)]Great Butter[VAR FF00(0000)]!
Now this looks like the good stuff! Why don’t we\ncall it Great Butter?[VAR 0114(0006)]
Now this looks like the good stuff! Why don’t we\ncall it Great Butter?[VAR 0114(0005)]
I bet this’ll level up Ansha’s donut game![VAR 0114(0006)]
I bet this’ll level up Ansha’s donut game![VAR 0114(0005)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Nice battling, [VAR 0100(0000)]! Now\nlet’s\r\nget\r\nback\r\nto\r\nHotel Z![VAR 0114(0192)]
[~ 188]
We’re back![VAR 0114(0006)]
We’re back![VAR 0114(0005)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Show Ansha what we found,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0006)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Show Ansha what we found,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0005)]
Whatever could it be?[VAR 0114(01A5)]
You showed Ansha the Great Butter!
More wonderful butter! How lovely![VAR 0114(01A5)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Y’know, [VAR 018B(0001)], I’m starting to crave\na\r\nnice\r\nHotel Z\r\ndinner![VAR 0114(0192)]
I’ll get started in the kitchen![VAR 0114(0006)]
Heard—and coming right up![VAR 0114(0005)]
What’s it like battling Rogue Mega-Evolved\nPokémon in Hyperspace Lumiose?[VAR 0114(000C)]
They’re way too strong!
Not bad with three of us
[VAR BD06(0000)]You give ’em a run for their money,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0192)]
[VAR BD06(0000)][VAR 0100(0000)] and [VAR 1100(00FF,0606)]TaunieUrbain are\nreally\r\ncarrying\r\nus\r\nthrough![VAR 0114(0192)]
It’s nuts how powered up the wild Pokémon in\nHyperspace Lumiose are...[VAR 0114(0006)]
It’s nuts how powered up the wild Pokémon in\nHyperspace Lumiose are...[VAR 0114(0005)]
I suppose that would be the “hyperspace level”\nphenomenon Corbeau mentioned to us?\c\nI’m surprised you’re still able to beat them.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Well, we’ve got an ace up our sleeve. Right,\nAnsha?[VAR 0114(0006)]
Well, we’ve got an ace up our sleeve. Right,\nAnsha?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Right! Mr. Corbeau taught me something\nintriguing.[VAR 0114(01A5)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]When [VAR 0100(0000)] and company\npass\r\nthrough\r\na\r\nhyperspace\r\ndistortion...\c\nit appears their Pokémon receive a portion of the\npower that Hoopa gained from eating its donut![VAR 0114(01A5)]
Whoa! That’s cool.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Your donuts and Hoopa’s powers are really\nworking in beautiful harmony![VAR 0114(0192)]
Pii hya! ♪
Let’s dig in! Gotta keep our energy up to sustain\nour Hyperspace Lumiose research![VAR 0114(0006)]
Let’s dig in! Gotta keep our energy up to sustain\nour Hyperspace Lumiose research![VAR 0114(0005)]
It was nice of Lebanne to send us some apology\ngoodies to go with dinner.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Lebanne’s a strong Mega Evolution user too,\nright? I gotta challenge her to a battle soon!\c\nPart of being the Mega Evolution successor is\nseeing the different ways Trainers and their\r\nPokémon use it![VAR 0114(0192)]
You just got done battling a Rogue Mega-Evolved\nPokémon and you’re still hungry to battle a Mega\r\nEvolution user?![VAR 0114(000C)]
Yeah! I’m out to experience Mega Evolution in all\nits incredible shapes and forms![VAR 0114(0192)]
[~ 220]
Hey, Ansha. That distortion above the tower’s got\nyou worried, huh?[VAR 0114(0192)]
Yes. I feel as if I can almost hear...a voice calling\nfaintly from it.[VAR 0114(01A5)]
Well, that’s eerie.[VAR 0114(0192)]
Maybe there’s a Pokémon on the other side that’s\ntrying to tell us something?[VAR 0114(0192)]
We’ll have to keep surveying to find out...which\nmeans we’ll need your donut teamwork![VAR 0114(0192)]
Pii hya.
Anyway, you’d better head back to your hotel for\nthe night before Lebanne blows a gaske— I mean,\r\nbefore Lebanne gets worried![VAR 0114(0192)]
I suppose I’d better.[VAR 0114(01A5)]
Good night, Ms. Korrina.[VAR 0114(01A5)]

The next day...
Your alarm is going off...
[~ 2]
It’s good that Jett announced we’re looking into\nhyperspace distortions and all, but I’ve gotta say...\c\nI’m kind of shocked everyone in the city isn’t\nreally panicking.[VAR 0114(0006)]
It’s good that Jett announced we’re looking into\nhyperspace distortions and all, but I’ve gotta say...\c\nI’m kind of shocked everyone in the city isn’t\nreally panicking.[VAR 0114(0005)]
And what about you, [VAR 018B(0001)]? Is it really OK that\nyou keep blowing off Quasartico for this?[VAR 0114(000C)]
There’s definitely a stack of work waiting for me\nat Quasartico...[VAR 0114(0006)]
There’s definitely stuff at Quasartico that I should\nbe doing...[VAR 0114(0005)]
But surveying Hyperspace Lumiose is more\nurgent! The whole city’s counting on us![VAR 0114(0006)]
But surveying Hyperspace Lumiose is more\nurgent! The whole city’s counting on us![VAR 0114(0005)]
That’s what’s up! I can see why you’re Team MZ’s\nleader![VAR 0114(0192)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Between you, me, and\n[VAR 0100(0000)]...\c\nwe can save any Pokémon that Rogue Mega\nEvolves![VAR 0114(0192)]
How noble! To save Pokémon not only of our city\nbut of Hyperspace Lumiose too...[VAR 0114(01A5)]
What an amazing bunch Team MZ is![VAR 0114(01A5)]
Thanks, Ansha.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Real kind of you, Ansha.[VAR 0114(0005)]
I’m proud to be helping your Hyperspace Lumiose\nsurvey work along with Ms. Korrina![VAR 0114(01A5)]
There would be no surveys without you two.\nYou’re practically Team MZ members yourselves.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Wait, what? I thought we’d added ’em to the\nteam already.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Wait, I thought they were already members![VAR 0114(0005)]
Well, I haven’t got Team MZ’s logo anywhere on\nmy garments...[VAR 0114(01A5)]
I couldn’t bring myself to stitch up your haute\ncouture coat with our logo, Ansha...[VAR 0114(000B)]
Hello, Team MZ. Lovely morning to you all.[VAR 0114(0013)]
I hate to put a damper on the day, but we’re not\ndone analyzing your survey data yet.[VAR 0114(0013)]
I’ll let you know the moment we’ve got something\nto report. Be good until then, kids.[VAR 0114(0013)]
I dunno how Corbeau got to be our go-to guy for\nall things Hyperspace Lumiose...but he’s\r\nsurprisingly on the ball![VAR 0114(0006)]
I dunno how Corbeau got to be our go-to guy for\nall things Hyperspace Lumiose...but he’s\r\nsurprisingly on the ball![VAR 0114(0005)]
Ooh, I’ve got a kinda neat idea![VAR 0114(0192)]
What’s up?
Only kinda?
I just thought it’d be fun to see the sights of\nLumiose instead of twiddling our thumbs here![VAR 0114(0192)]
You can’t be satisfied shuttling between here and\nRichissime—right, Ansha?[VAR 0114(0192)]
Well, since you mention it...I’ve been hoping to\nexperience Café Soleil for myself![VAR 0114(01A5)]
There ya go! I’ve got an exhibit I wanna see at the\nLumiose Museum.[VAR 0114(0192)]
That sounds lovely! I’d like to pay the museum a\nvisit too.[VAR 0114(01A5)]
Then we’ve got ourselves a plan![VAR 0114(0192)]
First stop, the Lumiose Museum. Second, a little\nsophisticated lounging at Café Soleil.[VAR 0114(0192)]
Wanna be our guide, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0192)]
You’ve definitely earned a break from making\ndonuts, Ansha. Time to be a kid and have fun![VAR 0114(000C)]
We’re off to the Lumiose Museum! See you there![VAR 0114(0192)]
Bummer. I was hoping to get a Pokémon battle\nwith Korrina.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Too bad. I was hoping for a Pokémon battle with\nKorrina.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Wow, Ansha wants to go to Café Soleil? Kid’s got\ntaste![VAR 0114(000C)]
It’s strange now to remember that Team MZ once\nonly had three members. We’ve certainly grown.[VAR 0114(000B)]
I told you we’d let you know when we’ve got\nsomething to report. No need to check up on us![VAR 0114(0013)]
Please enjoy a bit of free time while we prepare a\nreport from your survey data.[VAR 0114(0014)]
I’d prefer that we resolve this hyperspace matter\nbefore the people of Lumiose start to panic.[VAR 0114(000E)]
[~ 47]
One look into the Lumiose Museum and you can\ntell it’s remarkable!\c\nIf buildings were Pokémon Trainers, this one\nwould be a Champion for sure![VAR 0114(0192)]
I’ve never had a chance to visit, even with how\nclose it is to Hotel Richissime.[VAR 0114(01A5)]
I’ll be our tour guide! As long as you two don’t\nmind that I know nothing about art.[VAR 0114(0192)]
By all means![VAR 0114(01A5)]
Then let’s begin with that painting over there![VAR 0114(0192)]
Lead the way, Ms. Korrina![VAR 0114(01A5)]
[~ 54]
What a fantastical-looking city. Does such a place\nreally exist?[VAR 0114(01A5)]
It sure does.[VAR 0114(0192)]
The Gym Leader there is pretty mystifying herself.[VAR 0114(0192)]
That tree in the painting’s supposed to be 1,500\nyears old. Maybe AZ watched it grow up![VAR 0114(0192)]
I bet you’re right
I dunno, maybe...
I’m sure his long years of wandering took him to\nall kinds of places.[VAR 0114(0192)]
I would quite like to see this 1,500-year-old tree.[VAR 0114(01A5)]
It’s ours for the seeing!\c\nPeople can go practically anywhere as long as\nthey’ve got Pokémon![VAR 0114(0192)]
My dear mama once told me the same thing!\c\nShe said it’s part of what makes a Trainer’s\npartnership with their Pokémon so amazing.[VAR 0114(01A5)]
I’ve gone all over the place with Lucario and the\nrest of my team, and I think your mom’s spot-on![VAR 0114(0192)]
OK, let’s see what’s upstairs![VAR 0114(0192)]
[~ 67]
One truly appreciates the scale of Lumiose City\nwhen seeing it laid out this way.[VAR 0114(01A5)]
Hotel Richissime and this museum would be...\nover there, right?[VAR 0114(0192)]
Indeed. They’re a fairly long way from Hotel Z,\nwith many people filling the city between them.[VAR 0114(01A5)]
Yeah. This city’s sheer charm draws all kinds of\npeople here.[VAR 0114(0192)]
Though Lumiose can also be a disaster magnet.\c\nThat big power outage, the tower running wild—\nand now there’s Hyperspace Lumiose too.[VAR 0114(0192)]
That’s true. As much as I hope to find that fine\nLegendary Pokémon in hyperspace...[VAR 0114(01A5)]
the idea that Hyperspace Lumiose could merge\nwith Lumiose is troubling.[VAR 0114(01A5)]
It’ll be OK!
We’ll stop it
Yeah! That’s why we’re doing all this survey\nwork—to make sure things turn out OK.[VAR 0114(0192)]
Plus, we’re gonna find what’s causing all this\nRogue Mega Evolution and stop it! We won’t let\r\nthose poor Pokémon keep suffering.[VAR 0114(0192)]
Indeed! I’ll make donuts diligently to support you![VAR 0114(01A5)]
Is it all right if we go see what’s on display over\nthere?[VAR 0114(01A5)]
You bet![VAR 0114(0192)]
[~ 82]
It’s remarkable that people in the olden days used\nhandmade Poké Balls to catch Pokémon.[VAR 0114(01A5)]
They sure had it rough.\c\nThank goodness we can mass-produce ’em now,\nlike at the Poké Ball Factory here in Kalos.[VAR 0114(0192)]
Getting interested in catching some Pokémon for\nyourself, Ansha?\c\nSeems more like you’re Hoopa’s friend than its\nTrainer, but I bet you’d do a great job![VAR 0114(0192)]
I’m not quite sure I’m up to the challenge of\nbecoming a Pokémon Trainer.\c\nEspecially considering the examples I’d have to\nlive up to...such as my dear, mighty mama.[VAR 0114(01A5)]
Being a Pokémon Trainer doesn’t mean you have\nto try to be the strongest one, y’know! Although...[VAR 0114(0192)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]I’m curious how it’d feel to reach Rank A in the\nZ-A Royale. Anything to share,\r\n[VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0192)]
I was too busy to notice
I was over the moon!
Makes sense. You were doing it so you could stop\nthe tower from wrecking the city, after all.[VAR 0114(0192)]
Well, Ansha, if you change your mind about\nbecoming a Pokémon Trainer, let us know!\c\nI’ll put you through the wring—uh, my special\ncoaching process![VAR 0114(0192)]
You’re very kind! I’ll consider it.[VAR 0114(01A5)]
Shall we move on to the next exhibit?[VAR 0114(01A5)]
Shall we ever![VAR 0114(0192)]
[~ 96]
This is the Temple of Sinnoh! They say some\nLegendary Pokémon appeared here.[VAR 0114(0192)]
Hmm. What if we found a section of Hyperspace\nLumiose resembling this temple...?[VAR 0114(01A5)]
Do you think the fine Legendary Pokémon I’m\nlooking for would be there?[VAR 0114(01A5)]
Hard to say... Maybe? If the Pokémon you’re after\nhad something to do with this temple, that is.[VAR 0114(0192)]
That would make sense...[VAR 0114(01A5)]
Hey—don’t forget you’ve already got a spectacular\nPokémon in Hoopa right there!\c\nMaybe it seems like no big deal since you’re\ntogether all the time, but that one’s special![VAR 0114(0192)]
Pii hya hya.
How’d you meet Hoopa, anyway?
When did you and Hoopa meet?
I happened upon Hoopa...oh, I suppose it was\nabout six months ago now.\c\nThe poor thing looked much the worse for wear.\nIt seemed to have just lost a battle with a mighty\r\nPokémon it played a prank on.[VAR 0114(01A5)]
But I fed Hoopa a fresh-baked donut and it perked\nup straightaway![VAR 0114(01A5)]
It’s stuck by my side ever since—and helped me\nvisit hyperspace as well![VAR 0114(01A5)]
Whoa. So your donuts were so tasty that they\nunlocked Hoopa’s inner power?[VAR 0114(0192)]
I guess people and Pokémon meet for a reason—\neven if we’re not their Trainers![VAR 0114(0192)]
OK! My turn to pick an exhibit. Follow me![VAR 0114(0192)]
Wait, Ms. Korrina![VAR 0114(01A5)]
[~ 113]
Check out this painting, Ansha![VAR 0114(0192)]
What is that place?[VAR 0114(01A5)]
It’s called the Tower of Mastery! I trained there for\nages.[VAR 0114(0192)]
Did you always know you wanted to be a\nPokémon Trainer, Ms. Korrina?[VAR 0114(01A5)]
Not exactly. When I was a kid, my parents were\nsuper busy—kinda like yours, Ansha.\c\nI hung out with my grandpa a lot and naturally\nstarted to follow in his footsteps. That’s how I\r\nended up becoming a Trainer.[VAR 0114(0192)]
Is our conversation about whether you want to be\na Trainer weighing on you?[VAR 0114(0192)]
I suppose so. It’s mostly to do with my dear\nmama.\c\nI look up to her very much, so I’d love to be able\nto gift her with that fine Pokémon.[VAR 0114(01A5)]
But if I became a Trainer, I worry I’d never live up\nto the standard she’s set.[VAR 0114(01A5)]
Maybe, maybe not!\c\nI bet as long as you do what you really want,\nshe’ll be happy for you.[VAR 0114(0192)]
That’s what my grandpa wanted for me, anyway.[VAR 0114(0192)]
Although he does sometimes sigh and ask what\nhappened to the quiet little kid I used to be! Haha![VAR 0114(0192)]
Goodness![VAR 0114(01A5)]
Either way, you’re already amazing, Ansha.[VAR 0114(0192)]
Even if you aren’t a Trainer, you’ve befriended a\nPokémon like Hoopa—that’s really something![VAR 0114(0192)]
Anyway, I think I’m all museumed out! Should we\nhead to the Bleu District and visit Café Soleil?[VAR 0114(0192)]
Yes, please![VAR 0114(01A5)]
[~ 130]
Welcome! May I help you?
So this is Café Soleil. What a lovely-looking place![VAR 0114(01A5)]
I’ll order for us. Go ahead and grab a seat![VAR 0114(0192)]
Do you take your coffee with sugar, Ansha?[VAR 0114(0192)]
I’ll try without. That’s how my dear mama takes\nhers.[VAR 0114(01A5)]
This is the flavor Mama loves so much?\c\nI...may need to wait and approach it again when\nI’m a bit more grown-up.[VAR 0114(01A5)]
Your Soleil Blend is looking real good to me![VAR 0114(0192)]
Trade you for my Moomoo Milk Tea?[VAR 0114(0192)]
If you don’t mind that I’ve already taken a sip![VAR 0114(01A5)]
Deal![VAR 0114(0192)]
Let me guess, Hoopa. You’re thinking you’d rather\nhave one of Ansha’s donuts than this stuff?[VAR 0114(0192)]
Pii hya hya! ♪
You get an amazing boost of power whenever you\neat one of Ansha’s donuts, right?[VAR 0114(0192)]
But even so, you took a licking from some\namazing Pokémon before Ansha found you?[VAR 0114(0192)]
Pii hya...
And then you went and took Ansha into\nhyperspace with you?\c\nI guess I’m just now realizing how glad we should\nbe that she came back unharmed![VAR 0114(0192)]
Pi hyaaa.
We wouldn’t be able to do any of our survey work\nin Hyperspace Lumiose without you two.\c\nSo if things get rough, ask us for help! We gotta\ntake care of you![VAR 0114(0192)]
Let’s keep up the good work—for all of Lumiose’s\nsake![VAR 0114(0192)]
Pii hya hya.
When you think about it, what Ansha’s doing is\nway more impressive than just being a Trainer![VAR 0114(0192)]
Right, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0192)]
It definitely is impressive!
Glad you’re with us, Ansha!
Thank you for saying so.[VAR 0114(01A5)]
Looking back, it was reckless of me to dive\nheadlong into Hyperspace Lumiose.\c\nBut when Hoopa pried open that distortion, I\nsimply couldn’t fight my curiosity.[VAR 0114(01A5)]
Yeah, that’s human nature! Who wouldn’t try to\npeek through and see what’s on the other side?[VAR 0114(0192)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]You’d do the same—right,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0192)]
I’d totally peek
I think I’d pass
I knew it![VAR 0114(0192)]
For real? How’d you get to be such a strong\nTrainer without being more curious?[VAR 0114(0192)]
Wow, I lost track of time chatting! I bet we’ll hear\nfrom Corbeau pretty soon, huh?[VAR 0114(0192)]
Most likely. As much as I hate for our fun to end,\nwe’d better return to Hotel Z.[VAR 0114(01A5)]
[~ 165]
The gang’s all back![VAR 0114(000C)]
How was playing tourist for a change?[VAR 0114(000C)]
Oh, it was lovely! What a luxurious way to pass\nthe time![VAR 0114(01A5)]
Lucky you! Wish I could’ve tagged along.[VAR 0114(000C)]
You can visit the museum and go to cafés literally\nany time you want.[VAR 0114(000B)]
You just don’t get it, Naveen.[VAR 0114(000C)]
I guess we’ve got more important things to talk\nabout.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Indeed—well done not derailing the conversation.[VAR 0114(000B)]
We have something for you, Ansha.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Whatever could it be?[VAR 0114(01A5)]
Why, look at my apron—it’s emblazoned with our\nlogo![VAR 0114(01A5)]
Pii hyaaa!
Just a little something we whipped up while you\nwere out on the town![VAR 0114(000C)]
“We”?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Welcome to Team MZ, Ansha![VAR 0114(0006)]
Welcome to Team MZ, Ansha![VAR 0114(0005)]
Thank you, thank you! I’m so pleased to be\nmatching with everyone at last![VAR 0114(01A5)]
How come only Ansha gets a logo? Can’t you sew\none onto my outfit too?[VAR 0114(0192)]
The Mega Stones all over your clothes don’t leave\nmuch space to work with, Korrina...[VAR 0114(000B)]
Oh. True![VAR 0114(0192)]
These Mega Stones are symbols of my bonds\nwith my Pokémon. I’d never take ’em off![VAR 0114(0192)]
Logo or no-go, Korrina, you’re part of Team MZ\ntoo![VAR 0114(0006)]
Logo or no-go, Korrina, you’re part of Team MZ\ntoo![VAR 0114(0005)]
Wait... Did you all hear that? Sounded like it came\nfrom the strategy meeting room...[VAR 0114(000C)]
Let’s go see what it was.[VAR 0114(0006)]
We’d better see what it was.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Go check that room, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0192)]
You never know what’s gonna happen in an old\nbuilding like this.[VAR 0114(0006)]
You never know what’s gonna happen in an old\nbuilding like this.[VAR 0114(0005)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Go check the strategy meeting room,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0192)]
That sound couldn’t have been, uh...AZ’s ghost,\ncould it?[VAR 0114(000C)]
I’m not convinced this sound was anything more\nthan your imaginations playing tricks on you...[VAR 0114(000B)]
There aren’t any guests today, are there?[VAR 0114(01A5)]
Pii hya?
No one seems to be here.[VAR 0114(01A5)]
Guess we’ve got ghosts.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Please don’t start.[VAR 0114(000B)]
What’s wrong? Getting flashbacks to Rogue\nMega Banette?[VAR 0114(000C)]
Come on, Naveen. You’re not actually scared.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Come on, Naveen. You’re not actually scared.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Glupp!
NYAAAH![VAR 0114(000B)]
This Gulpin must’ve come from Hyperspace\nLumiose, right?[VAR 0114(0006)]
This Gulpin must’ve come from Hyperspace\nLumiose, right?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Yeah. I know Emma’s been dealing with cases\nwhere Pokémon mysteriously appear, and I think\r\nthis Gulpin probably turned up the same way.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Yeesh. I bet Pokémon will pop up like this all over\nthe city if we don’t take care of things.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Yeesh. I bet Pokémon will pop up like this all over\nthe city if we don’t take care of things.[VAR 0114(0005)]
What shall we do about our Gulpin guest?[VAR 0114(01A5)]
I wonder if the tasty smell of Chef Ansha’s\ndonuts lured it here.[VAR 0114(000C)]
I suppose it could just live here, couldn’t it?\c\nAZ let Pokémon stay here, after all. And I’m\nwilling to forget the scare it gave me.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Hello again, helpful squad. Sorry for the holdup.[VAR 0114(0013)]
We’ve gone over the data from your missions...\nand we learned something big.[VAR 0114(0013)]
I need our Rogue Mega Evolution task force over\nhere pronto. All three of you![VAR 0114(0013)]
Wow, you’re a task force now. You gonna go,\n[VAR 018B(0001)]?[VAR 0114(000C)]
Obviously![VAR 0114(0006)]
Obviously![VAR 0114(0005)]
Lida, Naveen—can you two hold down the fort\nand look after Ansha?[VAR 0114(0006)]
Lida, Naveen—can you two hold down the fort\nand look after Ansha?[VAR 0114(0005)]
We definitely owe Corbeau an in-person visit after\nall the data crunching he’s done. Let’s go![VAR 0114(0192)]
I shall be the most welcoming receptionist I can![VAR 0114(01A5)]
Pii hya!
Maybe I’ll clean up around the hotel a little.[VAR 0114(000C)]
I don’t expect we’ll have much to take care of\nhere. Guests haven’t exactly been lining up.[VAR 0114(000B)]
You should hurry on to your destination!
[~ 230]
There you are. Let’s skip the how-do-you-dos.[VAR 0114(0013)]
That distortion above what used to be Prism\nTower continues to confound us.[VAR 0114(0013)]
All this research, and we’re still in the dark about\nthat massive...whatever it is.[VAR 0114(0013)]
That sounds challenging
You’ve got a lot on your plate
Eh, maybe. But it’s not all bad news.\c\nAfter poring over all this data, we’ve come up\nwith a theory about Hyperspace Lumiose itself.[VAR 0114(0013)]
We think Hyperspace Lumiose is sort of a big\nmélange of subconscious thoughts.[VAR 0114(0013)]
I...don’t think I get it.[VAR 0114(0192)]
It’s a little difficult for me to even explain, truth be\ntold.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Philippe, fill ’em in.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Well, to elaborate on the boss’s summary...[VAR 0114(0014)]
The degree to which Hyperspace Lumiose\nresembles parts of our city made us suspicious.[VAR 0114(0014)]
So, we went looking through your survey data to\nsee if we could find a cause for the resemblance.[VAR 0114(0014)]
We’ve come to suspect that it’s not Lumiose itself\nbeing reflected per se, but rather memories of it—\r\nin other words, the subconscious.[VAR 0114(0014)]
Thanks for the crash course, Philippe.[VAR 0114(0013)]
We’re not through analyzing yet. Who knows?\nMaybe it’s a reflection of the subconscious of\r\npeople AND Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0013)]
There’s a lot more we need to learn—which\nmeans you’ve got a lot more surveying to do![VAR 0114(0013)]
If Hyperspace Lumiose keeps expanding at this\nrate, there’s no telling what havoc might occur...[VAR 0114(0013)]
We’ve got this
We’ll stop it
Good, because Team MZ’s pretty much all we can\ncount on!\c\nBut don’t get overconfident. It’s still tough in\nthere! Use [VAR FF00(0006)]Exp. Candies[VAR FF00(0000)] you find in hyperspace\r\nto beef up your Pokémon if you need to.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Yeah—our Pokémon don’t seem to get Exp. Points\nfrom defeating Pokémon in Hyperspace Lumiose,\r\nso that’ll definitely help. Thanks, Corbeau.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Yeah—our Pokémon don’t seem to get Exp. Points\nfrom defeating Pokémon in Hyperspace Lumiose,\r\nso that’ll definitely help. Thanks, Corbeau.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Guess we’d better order up some more donuts\nfrom Chef Ansha![VAR 0114(0192)]
These ought to be of some help in your research,\n[VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(000E)]
Good luck out there.[VAR 0114(0013)]
As always, we’re crossing our fingers for your\nsuccess.[VAR 0114(0014)]
Thank you for rising to the occasion once more.[VAR 0114(000E)]
[~ 259]
Fine work out there.[VAR 0114(0014)]
You’ve accumulated enough points to advance\nour research.[VAR 0114(0014)]
There’s also a particular hyperspace distortion we\nask that you look into. I’ve marked it on your map.[VAR 0114(0014)]
Best of luck.[VAR 0114(0014)]
Seems like you, Korrina, and [VAR 1100(00FF,0606)]TaunieUrbain have a\nPokémon to save from Rogue Mega Evolution![VAR 0114(000C)]
Congratulations on a hyperspace survey\nsuccessfully surveyed.[VAR 0114(000B)]
[~ 266]
An overwhelming swell of Mega Power has been\ndetected within Hyperspace Lumiose!\c\nA Pokémon inside must be about to Rogue Mega\nEvolve! Will you enter and calm it?
I’m going in now!
I need to prepare
We need a donut to get into Hyperspace Lumiose,\ndon’t we?[VAR 0114(0192)]
Oh—wait one sec, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nWe’ve gotta catch the Rogue Pokémon in there,\nso make sure you’ve got room in your Boxes![VAR 0114(0192)]
OK! Here we go into Hyperspace Lumiose![VAR 0114(0192)]
[~ 273]
Why are we in a sushi restaurant?[VAR 0114(0192)]
And why is everything way too big? This place is\nreally glitched out...[VAR 0114(0192)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Whoa! [VAR 0100(0000)]! Look—in the\nmiddle\r\nof\r\nthe\r\nbattle\r\ncourt![VAR 0114(0192)]
How many people is that supposed to serve?\nI can’t even imagine how anyone made it![VAR 0114(0192)]
It’s the sushi to end all sushi...[VAR 0114(0006)]
That’s definitely a sushi of all time.[VAR 0114(0005)]
[~ 280]
Whoever made this sushi platter was really\ncommitted to their vision—or to doing a bit.[VAR 0114(0192)]
This sushi isn’t gonna Mega Evolve, is it?[VAR 0114(0006)]
This sushi isn’t gonna Mega Evolve, is it?[VAR 0114(0005)]
C’mon, you know that’s not how it works! Is\nMega Evolution a joke to you or something?[VAR 0114(0192)]
The concentration of Mega Power in your vicinity\nis rising rapidly!\c\nWarning: Rogue Mega Evolution is imminent!
I’m ready to handle it!
I need to prepare
Rogue Mega Evolution’s no joke. We’d better be\nready to use Mega Evolution and Plus Moves![VAR 0114(0192)]
Maybe my special curry could use some sushi...or\nI could just make it way bigger.\c\nOops, that can wait! Let’s win this. For Lumiose,\nand for whatever Pokémon here needs our help![VAR 0114(0006)]
Maybe my special curry could use some sushi...or\nI could just make it way bigger.\c\nOops, that can wait! Let’s win this. For Lumiose,\nand for whatever Pokémon here needs our help![VAR 0114(0005)]
[~ 291]
You need to catch the Tatsugiri you calmed!
Battling Mega Tatsugiri might’ve been easier if I\nweren’t so hungry...[VAR 0114(0192)]
Korrina... You could think about food in a battle\nthat fierce? Respect.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Korrina... You could think about food in a battle\nthat fierce? Respect.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Not bad, you three. The Rogue Mega Evolution\nreadings have disappeared.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Go on and give yourselves a break while we start\ncombing through this data.\c\nHopefully we’ll have some new learnings to share\ntomorrow.[VAR 0114(0013)]
That makes three times we’ve found one of these\ngold Bonus Balls after battling a Rogue Pokémon.\c\nGuess it’s not a coincidence![VAR 0114(0192)]
I’m gonna go way out on a limb and guess you’ll\nfind some butter in that thing![VAR 0114(0006)]
I’m gonna go way out on a limb and guess you’ll\nfind some butter in that thing![VAR 0114(0005)]
[~ 301]
The Poké Ball contained lots of Berries!
It also contained what seems to be some butter!
You obtained a pack of [VAR FF00(0008)]Amazing Butter[VAR FF00(0000)]!
That butter sure looks amazing. Might as well call\nit Amazing Butter, huh?[VAR 0114(0006)]
That butter sure looks amazing. Might as well call\nit Amazing Butter, huh?[VAR 0114(0005)]
I still don’t get why we’ve been finding butter\nwhen we calm these Rogue Pokémon...[VAR 0114(0006)]
I still don’t get why we’ve been finding butter\nwhen we calm these Rogue Pokémon...[VAR 0114(0005)]
But at least Ansha should be able to whip up\nsome even better donuts with it![VAR 0114(0006)]
But at least Ansha should be able to whip up\nsome even better donuts with it![VAR 0114(0005)]
Yeah, Ansha and the others are waiting for us!\nLet’s get back to Hotel Z, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0192)]
[~ 312]
Hey, Ansha! We found another cool hyperspace\nsouvenir.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Hey, Ansha! We found another cool hyperspace\nsouvenir.[VAR 0114(0005)]
You showed Ansha the Amazing Butter!
How wonderful. I’ll be glad to use it![VAR 0114(01A5)]
Now that we’re all back, I think it’s dinnertime![VAR 0114(000C)]
Listen—remember Corbeau and Philippe’s theory\nabout Hyperspace Lumiose?[VAR 0114(0192)]
The subconscious thing?
The memories thing?
Right! How Hyperspace Lumiose seems to reflect\nsubconscious thoughts and memories.\c\nI was skeptical, but after seeing that giant sushi...\nI dunno, maybe they’re right.[VAR 0114(0192)]
Does that mean Hyperspace Lumiose is made up\nof everyone’s dreams or something?[VAR 0114(000C)]
If it were EVERYONE’S dreams, it’d be even more\nchaotic than it already is.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Part of me wants to see what ridiculous chaos a\ndream world could produce...\c\nBut I guess we can’t let Hyperspace Lumiose keep\ngetting more out of hand.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Part of me wants to see what ridiculous chaos a\ndream world could produce...\c\nBut I guess we can’t let Hyperspace Lumiose keep\ngetting more out of hand.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Oh![VAR 0114(000C)]
What’s up?[VAR 0114(0192)]
I just realized—maybe Ansha saw that Legendary\nPokémon because Hyperspace Lumiose was\r\nreflecting her dreams, or wishes, or something![VAR 0114(000C)]
Perhaps you’re onto something, Lida.[VAR 0114(01A5)]
But would that mean Hyperspace Lumiose does\nindeed reflect our dreams? And if so, why?[VAR 0114(01A5)]
Yeah. Still a mystery.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Which is why Team MZ’s gonna get to the bottom\nof things![VAR 0114(0006)]
Which is why Team MZ’s gonna get to the bottom\nof things![VAR 0114(0005)]
So everyone eat up. We can’t investigate on empty\nstomachs![VAR 0114(0006)]
So everyone eat up. We can’t investigate on empty\nstomachs![VAR 0114(0005)]
Agreed![VAR 0114(01A5)]
Are the surveys of Hyperspace Lumiose making\nprogress?[VAR 0114(000D)]
Yes, ma’am.[VAR 0114(000E)]
The Rust Syndicate is working with admirable\nfervor, to say nothing of Team MZ.[VAR 0114(000E)]
Yet it seems the situation may be evolving even\nmore rapidly than we anticipated.[VAR 0114(000D)]
But those children are the ones with whom AZ\nentrusted our future. We can trust them too.[VAR 0114(000D)]
Indeed. I suppose our duty as their elders is to\nbelieve in them and offer support.[VAR 0114(000E)]
Please, Vinnie. Hadn’t you better leave the “elder”\ntalk to me?[VAR 0114(000D)]
I beg your pardon, ma’am. As you say.[VAR 0114(000E)]

The next day...
Your alarm is going off...
[~ 2]
Hey, I’ve been wondering... Who’s the stronger\nTrainer between the two of you?[VAR 0114(0192)]
Me, I guess?
[VAR 018B(0001)] for sure
We’re about even
I can buy that! You sure battle well in Hyperspace\nLumiose.[VAR 0114(0192)]
No kidding! I’m gonna have to battle you and find\nout for myself sometime.[VAR 0114(0192)]
Now I’ve got a question for you, Korrina! What do\nyou do when you’re not surveying hyperspace?[VAR 0114(000C)]
I stay on my grind! Gotta keep training so we can\nhelp those poor Rogue Mega-Evolved Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0192)]
These days, I’m focused on finding Mega\nEvolution users to battle![VAR 0114(0192)]
Must be nice living in Lumiose all year round.\nThere’s so much Mega Evolution happening![VAR 0114(0192)]
Do you think you could help with my training,\nKorrina? My partner can Mega Evolve.\c\nCome to think of it, so can Naveen’s...[VAR 0114(000C)]
Wait—where IS Naveen?[VAR 0114(000C)]
Probably sleeping off an all-nighter doing fashion\nsketches or something.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Probably sleeping off an all-nighter doing fashion\nsketches or something.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Oh no, that won’t do! We need Naveen well-rested\nand healthy![VAR 0114(01A5)]
I’m sure he’ll be rolling out of bed and coming\ndown to see us soon.[VAR 0114(000C)]
In fact, that must be him now![VAR 0114(000C)]
Huh?![VAR 0114(000C)]
That’s Naveen’s Scrafty, right?[VAR 0114(0192)]
Did it come down here because something’s up\nwith Naveen?[VAR 0114(0006)]
Did it come down here because something’s up\nwith Naveen?[VAR 0114(0005)]
I hope he’s OK... We’d better go check on him up\nin room 203![VAR 0114(000C)]
Weren’t you gonna go check on Naveen?[VAR 0114(0192)]
I wonder what’s up with Naveen. Why wouldn’t\nhe just call us if something was wrong?[VAR 0114(000C)]
Naveen’s Scrafty sure looks like it can handle\nitself![VAR 0114(0192)]
Naveen’s Scrafty can use the elevator on its own!\nHow impressive.[VAR 0114(01A5)]
Pii hya hya.
Kyururu.
[~ 31]
Naveen? Knock knock! We’re gonna come in if\nyou don’t answer us.[VAR 0114(000C)]
We sure about this? Naveen definitely won’t be\nhappy about us barging in.[VAR 0114(0006)]
We sure about this? Naveen definitely wouldn’t\nbe happy if we barged in.[VAR 0114(0005)]
How else are we supposed to check up on him?[VAR 0114(000C)]
We’re coming in, Naveen![VAR 0114(000C)]
Naveen? Groan if you’re alive![VAR 0114(0006)]
Naveen? Doing OK in there, bud?[VAR 0114(0005)]
[VAR BD06(0000)][VAR 0100(0000)], could you open the\ndoor?[VAR 0114(000C)]
Zaff.
[~ 41]
Where could it have gone?![VAR 0114(000B)]
Naveen?[VAR 0114(000C)]
Lida?![VAR 0114(000B)]
And you two! What are you doing in here?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Well, when your Scrafty came downstairs without\nyou, we obviously got a little worried.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Well, when your Scrafty came downstairs without\nyou, we obviously got a little worried.[VAR 0114(0005)]
It sounds like you’re looking for something?[VAR 0114(000C)]
Ugh. I really hoped I wouldn’t have to involve you\nin this...[VAR 0114(000B)]
My most precious Canari plush has gone missing.\nI’ve been combing my room for it.[VAR 0114(000B)]
That’s awful!
Can we help look?
I appreciate your sympathy—and would appreciate\neven more if you left it at that.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Wouldn’t it be faster if we helped?[VAR 0114(000C)]
You might think so.[VAR 0114(000B)]
But that would risk someone else’s hands\nactually touching my precious Canari plush![VAR 0114(000B)]
I can’t blame Scrafty for being concerned and\ncoming to get you, but I’ll be fine.[VAR 0114(000B)]
OK, whatever. Do you think you’ll find your little\ndoll and rejoin society anytime soon?[VAR 0114(000C)]
Excuse you! My Canari plush, you mean![VAR 0114(000B)]
If your Canari doll’s that important to you, why\ndidn’t you put it away where it’d be kept safe?[VAR 0114(0006)]
If your Canari doll’s that important to you, why\ndidn’t you put it away somewhere to keep it safe?[VAR 0114(0005)]
It’s a CANARI PLUSH![VAR 0114(000B)]
And I had it out where I could admire it anytime.\nI would NOT have moved it from its spot![VAR 0114(000B)]
Huh?[VAR 0114(000C)]
That’s our new Gulpin guest, isn’t it?[VAR 0114(000C)]
Don’t tell me...you ate it?![VAR 0114(000B)]
Glupp!
Aww. Looks more like your plush fell and rolled\nunder the bed, and Gulpin found it![VAR 0114(0006)]
Aww. Looks more like your plush fell and rolled\nunder the bed, and Gulpin found it![VAR 0114(0005)]
Thank you, Gulpin!\c\nWhat a relief to have my precious Canari plush\nback.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Morning, team.[VAR 0114(0013)]
We went through the data from the Tatsugiri you\ncaught that was going rogue. Took us all night...\r\nplus a platter of my homemade sushi.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Time for you lot to haul yourselves to our office\nagain for a briefing. See you soon.[VAR 0114(0013)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]All right, [VAR 0100(0000)]. Let’s get\nKorrina\r\nand\r\nhead\r\nto\r\nthe\r\nRust\r\nSyndicate\r\noffice![VAR 0114(0006)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]All right, [VAR 0100(0000)]. Let’s get\nKorrina\r\nand\r\nhead\r\nto\r\nthe\r\nRust\r\nSyndicate\r\noffice![VAR 0114(0005)]
Hope the briefing goes OK! We’ll keep Ansha\ncompany here.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Corbeau’s got a weird knack for calling us right\nwhen we’re between things, doesn’t he?[VAR 0114(000C)]
Should I put my Canari plush in a case?\c\nNo, no—I couldn’t bear to put any walls between\nus...[VAR 0114(000B)]
Are we quite sure our Gulpin guest wasn’t trying\nto eat the plush?[VAR 0114(01A5)]
Pii hya hya.
Kyururu.
You should hurry on to your destination!
Look, I’m glad you’re so eager to keep working,\nbut you don’t need to pop in here ALL the time.[VAR 0114(0013)]
We truly appreciate your hard work.[VAR 0114(0014)]
That distortion looming over the tower always\ntugs at the corner of my mind...[VAR 0114(000E)]
[~ 86]
Why do you keep this place so dark and gloomy,\nCorbeau? It’d look magnificent in proper lighting![VAR 0114(0192)]
I like to keep things calm. The dark suits me—\nhence my dark suit.[VAR 0114(0013)]
That was...a joke, right?[VAR 0114(0006)]
That was...a joke, right?[VAR 0114(0005)]
It was until you ruined it by asking!\c\nLet’s just cut to the chase.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Looking at the data we got from you catching the\nTatsugiri that’d gone rogue, well...[VAR 0114(0013)]
I won’t sugarcoat it—the Prism Tower situation’s\nstill one big mystery. Have a look for yourself.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Hyperspace Lumiose is continuing to bleed into\nregular Lumiose—possibly because of that giant\r\ndistortion over the tower, but I can’t say for sure.[VAR 0114(0013)]
At this rate, the whole city might get swallowed\nup by Hyperspace Lumiose.[VAR 0114(0013)]
We need to find out what’s causing this and stop\nHyperspace Lumiose from spreading![VAR 0114(0192)]
We do. Unfortunately, there’s still a whole lot left\nfor us to survey.[VAR 0114(0013)]
These ought to be of some help in your research,\n[VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(000E)]
There’s actually a bit of good news, too.\c\nThanks to all your hard work, we can now detect\nhigher-level hyperspace distortions![VAR 0114(0013)]
Hyperspace Lumiose awaits your surveying. Good\nluck out there![VAR 0114(0013)]
[~ 101]
Fine work out there.[VAR 0114(0014)]
You’ve accumulated enough points to advance\nour research.[VAR 0114(0014)]
We’ve also marked a particular hyperspace\ndistortion on your map.[VAR 0114(0014)]
As you can see, it’s appeared at Hotel Richissime.[VAR 0114(0014)]
Mr. Corbeau says he’s confident you’ll be able to\nhandle it just fine, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0014)]
But do please take the utmost care dealing with\nMs. Jacinthe.[VAR 0114(0014)]
I leave it to you. Best of luck.[VAR 0114(0014)]
Go do your thing![VAR 0114(0013)]
We remain in your corner, as ever.[VAR 0114(0014)]
We’re grateful for your unflagging effort.[VAR 0114(000E)]
[~ 112]
Oh! Hey, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(000C)]
I came to get some of Ansha’s stuff and take it to\nHotel Z for her.[VAR 0114(000C)]
But Jacinthe and Griselle are in the way—and\nthey look one wrong word away from exploding.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Can we ask Lebanne for help?
Should we try to push through?
You really think Lebanne of all people would be\nable to defuse Jacinthe?[VAR 0114(000C)]
That crosses the line from bravery to death wish.\nCount me out![VAR 0114(000C)]
These two are a pair of unstoppable forces.\nNeither one’s gonna back down![VAR 0114(000C)]
You misunderstand me—I would never deign to\nlet price dictate the taste or quality of coffee.[VAR 0114(0015)]
However, your churlish words and actions would\ncheapen the taste of even your best brew.[VAR 0114(0015)]
Ha! Listen. People flock to Nouveau Café for two\nthings: my roasts...and my ROASTS.[VAR 0114(0018)]
Trying to play off your coarseness as some lovable\nquirk? Incroyable...[VAR 0114(0015)]
No coffee brewed by such a barbarous boor will\nbesmirch my palate![VAR 0114(0015)]
That’s not what your hotel’s famous chef said\nwhen she put Nouveau Café on her list of\r\nLumiose’s most noteworthy coffees![VAR 0114(0018)]
Your impudence truly knows no bounds.[VAR 0114(0015)]
You there![VAR 0114(0015)]
Uh-oh. Guess we’re caught.[VAR 0114(000C)]
If it isn’t [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0018)]
You heard all that, didn’t you?[VAR 0114(0018)]
So who’s right? Obviously I am, but I want to hear\nyou say it.[VAR 0114(0018)]
Uh... Maybe Jacinthe’s right?
I’m with Griselle, I guess...?
You both make great points
Are you so terrified of Jacinthe that you can only\nsqueak out a half answer?[VAR 0114(0018)]
You must not allow her menacing manner to\nintimidate you into making a foolish choice![VAR 0114(0015)]
Wow. And here I thought you had a spine.[VAR 0114(0018)]
Your lack of moral conviction requires correction—\nby force, if necessary.[VAR 0114(0015)]
Finally we agree on something.[VAR 0114(0018)]
So it would seem.[VAR 0114(0015)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]You need some straightening out, and we are\nmore than happy to oblige.\c\n[VAR 0100(0000)]! Prepare to face\nthe\r\ntwo\r\nof\r\nus![VAR 0114(0015)]
And look at that—you’ve got Lida. Two-on-two.\nFair’s fair![VAR 0114(0018)]
Why me?![VAR 0114(000C)]
[~ 145]
Do try and fight with elegance. Hotel Richissime\ndeserves no less, after all![VAR 0114(0015)]
I’m going to burn you to the ground! Maybe you\ncan find your backbone in the ashes![VAR 0114(0018)]
[~ 148]
It is our responsibility as elites to guide the\nmasses, Clefable![VAR 0114(0015)]
I’ve got to win this battle! We can’t let anyone\nstand in our way![VAR 0114(0018)]
[~ 151]
Alors, it appears we have lost.[VAR 0114(0015)]
Blame me. We could’ve won if I’d understood\nyour Clefable better.[VAR 0114(0018)]
If we are apportioning blame, there certainly are\nthings for which I must apologize as well...[VAR 0114(0015)]
How about we call it a good match and leave it at\nthat?[VAR 0114(0018)]
You are welcome to join and compete in Le Super-\nTournoi de Jacinthe Infinite anytime, my dear.[VAR 0114(0015)]
Ha, as if! I’m busy—I have an actual job. You\ncome to the café if you want to battle me![VAR 0114(0018)]
What the heck is going on here?[VAR 0114(0016)]
By the by, what brings two Team MZ members to\nHotel Richissime?[VAR 0114(0015)]
Uh, we...um...[VAR 0114(000C)]
Help, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(000C)]
We’re here to investigate something
We came to take care of some things
Business regarding Hyperspace Lumiose, no\ndoubt! Thank you for working to keep us all safe.[VAR 0114(0015)]
Should you encounter trouble, I am happy to lend\nmy support![VAR 0114(0015)]
Now, moving on...[VAR 0114(0015)]
There is no use hiding, Lebanne. Come on out.[VAR 0114(0015)]
You have thanked Team MZ properly, I hope?[VAR 0114(0015)]
Wha—? Uh...yes. Yes, of course I have![VAR 0114(0016)]
Very good.[VAR 0114(0015)]
They have been so kind to look after Miss Ansha\nafter you foisted that responsibility onto them.[VAR 0114(0015)]
I am eager to hear exactly how you have spent all\nthe time that must have freed up for you.[VAR 0114(0015)]
No! No, it’s not what you think!\c\nLady Jacinthe, I swear, I had Miss Ansha’s best\ninterests in mind![VAR 0114(0016)]
Do you believe invoking her name will save you?[VAR 0114(0015)]
All will be forgiven once you’ve won one hundred\nSuper-Tournoi de Jacinthe Infinite matches.\r\nIn a row.[VAR 0114(0015)]
Good luck. I’ll slip you some coffee during\nvisitation hours.[VAR 0114(0018)]
Appreciate you all taking care of this Hyperspace\nLumiose stuff.\c\nIf things boil over, you can count on Team Flare\nNouveau’s help![VAR 0114(0018)]
Watching Jacinthe and Griselle argue was even\nmore tense than that Pokémon battle, honestly.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Hey, I’m here! Sorry I’m late.\c\nReady to dive in and survey Hyperspace Lumiose\nwhen you are.[VAR 0114(0192)]
I better go take care of my errand for Ansha while\nthe coast’s clear. Good luck, you two![VAR 0114(000C)]
Guess that’s the hyperspace distortion we’re\ndealing with this time, huh?[VAR 0114(0192)]
We can’t let these Pokémon suffer from Rogue\nMega Evolution. We’ve gotta save ’em![VAR 0114(0192)]
[~ 183]
An overwhelming swell of Mega Power has been\ndetected within Hyperspace Lumiose!\c\nA Pokémon inside must be about to Rogue Mega\nEvolve! Will you enter and calm it?
I’m going in now!
I need to prepare
We need a donut to get into Hyperspace Lumiose,\ndon’t we?[VAR 0114(0192)]
Oh—wait one sec, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nWe’ve gotta catch the Rogue Pokémon in there,\nso make sure you’ve got room in your Boxes![VAR 0114(0192)]
All right! Let’s DO this![VAR 0114(0192)]
[~ 190]
You know, if Hyperspace Lumiose reflects\npeople’s or Pokémon’s subconscious thoughts...[VAR 0114(0192)]
you’d think it’d be easier to tell whose thoughts\nshaped this place.[VAR 0114(0192)]
Uh... You don’t think it’s reflecting the thoughts\nof that Meowstic right in front of us?[VAR 0114(0006)]
Uh... You don’t think it’s reflecting the thoughts\nof that Meowstic—the one right there?[VAR 0114(0005)]
That’s the thing—this place looks the same as\nwhere we fought Absol and Staraptor, right?\c\nSo did they have the same subconscious thoughts\nas this Meowstic? Pokémon are so mysterious...[VAR 0114(0192)]
Oh well. We know what we gotta do: save this\nMeowstic from Rogue Mega Evolution![VAR 0114(0192)]
[~ 197]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Meowstic can learn different moves depending on\nwhether they’re male or female, y’know.\c\nCan you tell what kind of Meowstic this is,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0192)]
Female?
Male?
You can always spot a female by its color—more\nwhite than blue. They’re better suited to offense.[VAR 0114(0192)]
Males have strong psychic power—same as the\nladies—but they’re a little more defense oriented.[VAR 0114(0192)]
The concentration of Mega Power in your vicinity\nis rising rapidly!\c\nWarning: Rogue Mega Evolution is imminent!
I’m ready to handle it!
I need to prepare
Good call! No getting lazy—we gotta make sure\nwe’re fully ready.[VAR 0114(0192)]
Rogue Mega-Evolved Pokémon are even tougher\nhere with their superhigh hyperspace levels.\r\nMake sure you’re ready![VAR 0114(0006)]
Rogue Mega-Evolved Pokémon are even tougher\nhere with their superhigh hyperspace levels.\r\nMake sure you’re ready![VAR 0114(0005)]
[~ 209]
You need to catch the Meowstic you calmed!
Mega Meowstic looks wild—like it’s got elements\nof a male and female combined.[VAR 0114(0192)]
[VAR 0100(0000)], [VAR 018B(0001)], Korrina...\c\nWell done, all of you.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Looks like it’ll be another late night—someone’s\ngot to go over this Rogue Mega Meowstic data...\c\nNo, no—don’t worry about us. You’ve all earned a\nbreak.[VAR 0114(0013)]
He sure takes his data analysis seriously, huh?[VAR 0114(0192)]
Anyway, we’ve heard from Corbeau, which means\nright about now...[VAR 0114(0192)]
It’s giant Poké Ball time![VAR 0114(0192)]
Crack it open, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0006)]
Crack it open, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0005)]
[~ 219]
The Poké Ball contained lots of Berries!
It also contained what seems to be some butter!
You obtained a pack of [VAR FF00(0008)]Supreme Butter[VAR FF00(0000)]!
I’ve never seen such beautifully churned butter!\nWe gotta call it Supreme Butter—nothing less![VAR 0114(0006)]
I’ve never seen such beautifully churned butter!\nWe gotta call it Supreme Butter—nothing less![VAR 0114(0005)]
I wonder if this butter’s the product of someone’s\nsubconscious thoughts, too?[VAR 0114(0006)]
I wonder if this butter’s the product of someone’s\nsubconscious thoughts, too?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Couldn’t say—but I’m sure it’ll give Ansha some\nhappy conscious thoughts! Let’s go show her![VAR 0114(0192)]
[~ 228]
Hey, Ansha! We’re back.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Hey, Ansha! We’re back.[VAR 0114(0005)]
You showed Ansha the Supreme Butter!
I’m shocked that such lovely butter even exists![VAR 0114(01A5)]
I’ll have to do it justice with my most exquisite\ndonuts yet![VAR 0114(01A5)]
Pii hyaaa!
I suppose it’s about time we got ready for dinner,\nisn’t it? I’ve tidied up the strategy meeting room.[VAR 0114(000B)]
What’s got you looking so worn down, Lida?[VAR 0114(0006)]
What’s got you looking so worn down, Lida?[VAR 0114(0005)]
I was stuck at Richissime for a while. I think the\nambient Jacinthe pressure got to me.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Ms. Jacinthe is very kind.[VAR 0114(01A5)]
She’s kept me company at mealtimes, since I\nhaven’t many friends around.[VAR 0114(01A5)]
How’d Jacinthe get to know your mom, anyway?\c\nDiantha must be super busy![VAR 0114(0192)]
I’ve been told my dear mama taught Ms. Jacinthe\nall she knows about Pokémon battles.[VAR 0114(01A5)]
Maybe your mom’s Gardevoir was what got\nJacinthe into Fairy types![VAR 0114(0192)]
I’ve never appreciated Diantha’s true skill till now.\c\nTaking on someone like Jacinthe as a pupil...?\nWhew! That takes some serious dedication![VAR 0114(000C)]
Your mom is Diantha, huh? What’s she up to\nthese days, Ansha?[VAR 0114(0006)]
Your mom is Diantha, huh? What’s she up to\nthese days, Ansha?[VAR 0114(0005)]
She’s off shooting a movie in a faraway region.\nMy dear mama...won’t be home for some time.[VAR 0114(01A5)]
And I suppose Hoopa can’t simply whisk you to\nher for a visit whenever you want?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Pii hyuuu...
It’s not so bad.[VAR 0114(01A5)]
When I make donuts, it feels as if Mama is right\nby my side![VAR 0114(01A5)]
Why’s that?[VAR 0114(000C)]
Because she taught me how to make donuts in\nthe first place, of course![VAR 0114(01A5)]
Pii hya hya!
It’s thanks to Mama’s donut-making lessons that\nI can help Hoopa open up hyperspace distortions.[VAR 0114(01A5)]
Good point! Not just any old donut can bring out\nHoopa’s power—it takes the Chef Ansha touch.[VAR 0114(000B)]
I hope so! I’d be very proud.[VAR 0114(01A5)]
You should be! Seems like the holes in your\ndonuts aren’t empty—they’re full of love![VAR 0114(0192)]
I’ll keep on making them with love and care so my\ndream can come true![VAR 0114(01A5)]
We appreciate your help!
We’re counting on you!
Pleased to be of service![VAR 0114(01A5)]

The next day...
Your alarm is going off...
[~ 2]
I had the creepiest dream last night. Maybe the\nstress from Jacinthe’s bad mood got to me...[VAR 0114(000C)]
Please, don’t make me listen to your creepy dream\ntalk. It will only be confusing and disturbing.[VAR 0114(000B)]
I know, I get it. It’s just really bothering me. It was\nso creepy...and so weird.\c\nI’ve never had a dream like that before. That\nterrifying voice telling me to “stay away”...[VAR 0114(000C)]
Morning, Team MZ![VAR 0114(0008)]
Nice donut shop! Things have changed since I\nlast came here.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Ah! Would you be Ms. Emma? The young head of\nthe Looker Bureau?[VAR 0114(01A5)]
That’s right. And you must be Ansha and Hoopa?[VAR 0114(0008)]
Pii hyaaa.
I hear we’ve got your pastries and powers to\nthank for Team MZ’s hyperspace survey efforts.[VAR 0114(0008)]
I really appreciate you both helping out![VAR 0114(0008)]
G-goodness. Well...would you care for a donut?[VAR 0114(01A5)]
Mrawr!
I think that’s Mimi’s way of saying “yummy”![VAR 0114(0008)]
What’s the story with Gulpin here?[VAR 0114(0008)]
We figure it came from Hyperspace Lumiose.\nSeems to like it here.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Ah, got it. Sounds like a lot of Pokémon have been\ncrossing over from Hyperspace Lumiose lately...\r\nIt’s keeping my docket full, that’s for sure.[VAR 0114(0008)]
But Pokémon are Pokémon no matter where they\ncome from, right?\c\nI bet AZ would be so happy to see you all making\nGulpin feel at home.[VAR 0114(0008)]
What was Mr. AZ like exactly, Ms. Emma? I don’t\nknow much—apart from that he lived quite long.[VAR 0114(01A5)]
Good question. He’s not an easy man to sum up.\c\nI think three thousand years of pain and regret left\nhim determined to prevent others from suffering.[VAR 0114(0008)]
He spent a lot of time here at Hotel Z staring up at\nPrism Tower, worrying about it and the city.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Did Mr. AZ build this hotel himself?[VAR 0114(01A5)]
Not exactly.\c\nHe was given the land by some bigwig as thanks\nfor creating a guardian to watch over Kalos.[VAR 0114(0008)]
When he went off to wander the world in search\nof Floette, he apparently asked some people to\r\ntake care of this plot of land for him.[VAR 0114(0008)]
And then those people opened lodgings here to\nhelp cover the cost of taking care of the land.\c\nThat’s what AZ told me.[VAR 0114(0006)]
And then those people opened lodgings here to\nhelp cover the cost of taking care of the land.\c\nThat’s what AZ told me.[VAR 0114(0005)]
But by the time we met AZ, he couldn’t spare\nmuch thought to running a hotel...[VAR 0114(000B)]
He had to find some younger people who could\nhelp stop the trouble with the tower, after all.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Ah, and that was how Team MZ came to be? I see.[VAR 0114(01A5)]
AZ was a good judge of character. He brought you\nall together, and you saved Lumiose![VAR 0114(0008)]
I’m glad that I’m part of Team MZ and my donuts\ncan help keep this city safe![VAR 0114(01A5)]
That’s great to hear, Ansha!\c\nOn that note, I brought a little something that\nmight help with your donuts.[VAR 0114(0008)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Here, [VAR 0100(0000)]—have these\nHyperspace\r\nBerries![VAR 0114(0008)]
I picked up a bunch of them while dealing with\nPokémon from Hyperspace Lumiose.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Bet you could make some great donuts with these\nin the pantry, right, Ansha?[VAR 0114(0008)]
I imagine so![VAR 0114(01A5)]
Keep up the good work, Team MZ! Let Mimi and\nme know if you ever need a hand.[VAR 0114(0008)]
I’m ready to support your survey work at any time.\nPlease don’t be shy—order a donut![VAR 0114(01A5)]
You’re the best, Ansha.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Thanks, Ansha.[VAR 0114(0005)]
I’m glad to see everyone doing their best, but\ndoes anyone else still feel uneasy somehow?\c\nI haven’t quite been able to settle down since we\nheard Corbeau’s theory about Hyperspace\r\nLumiose reflecting subconscious thoughts...[VAR 0114(000B)]
Aww, you had to go and mention him, didn’t you?[VAR 0114(0006)]
Aww, you had to go and mention him, didn’t you?[VAR 0114(0005)]
What? What do you mean?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Morning![VAR 0114(0013)]
Right on cue.[VAR 0114(000C)]
I’ll spare you the preamble. Come to HQ![VAR 0114(0013)]
Time for another rendezvous at Corbeau’s office.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Time for another rendezvous at Corbeau’s office.[VAR 0114(0005)]
I think Korrina’s out training. I’ll let her know.[VAR 0114(000B)]
I don’t think I’d be much use against the Rogue\nPokémon in Hyperspace Lumiose, but if there’s\r\nany way I can help, let me know![VAR 0114(000C)]
I can’t imagine you’re excited to traipse up to the\nRust Syndicate office again.[VAR 0114(000B)]
I’d be glad to make you some excellent donuts\nusing Hyperspace Berries![VAR 0114(01A5)]
Pii hya.
Kyururu. ♪
You should hurry on to your destination!
[~ 58]
Get Corbeau out here![VAR 0114(000F)]
Mr. Corbeau is otherwise engaged. Your patience\nis appreciated.[VAR 0114(0014)]
Then YOU tell him to quit draggin’ this meathead\ninto his business![VAR 0114(000F)]
Mr. Corbeau and Mr. Ivor have an arrangement.[VAR 0114(0014)]
Yeah, and their “arrangement” means G-Volt is\ngettin’ wrapped up in their mess![VAR 0114(000F)]
Now she’s tryin’ to run away and hide in her\nnonexistent world or whatever![VAR 0114(000F)]
Well, it’s not like we’re making Gwynn do\nanything all by herself!\c\nCorbeau convinced me that we need to take this\nhyperspace issue seriously. So, I have rallied the\r\nentire Fist of Justice to help out.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Philippe, the lobby’s where we welcome our\nguests. You’re supposed to keep things quiet.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Terribly sorry, boss.[VAR 0114(0014)]
Hey! Listen up![VAR 0114(000F)]
Keep G-Volt outta your stupid schemes![VAR 0114(000F)]
Whatever has been decided between Ivor and\nGwynn can be taken up with them.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Don’t come yelling about it to us.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Boss, if I may?\c\nA Pokémon battle might be the quickest way to\nsettle this and get our guests moving along.[VAR 0114(0014)]
Guess so.[VAR 0114(0013)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]C’mere, [VAR 0100(0000)]—you and me\nagainst\r\nIvor\r\nand\r\nCanari.[VAR 0114(0013)]
You gotta be kiddin’![VAR 0114(000F)]
[VAR 0100(0000)] oughta be on MY team![VAR 0114(000F)]
As long as I get to battle, I’m perfectly happy to\npartner up with anyone![VAR 0114(0011)]
Ugh... This is the worst. The WORST![VAR 0114(000F)]
Fine! Let’s get it over with![VAR 0114(000F)]
[~ 80]
We’re seriously done playin’ around! Eelektross,\nlet’s crank up the voltage with Mega Evolution![VAR 0114(000F)]
Strength is power! Strength is justice![VAR 0114(0011)]
[~ 83]
I’m charged up on energy drinks—time to charge\nyou up with Mega Evolution, Eelektross! Let’s go![VAR 0114(000F)]
Time to Mega Evolve, Falinks! Justice WILL win\nthe day![VAR 0114(0011)]
[~ 86]
It’s so over... Sorry, G-Volt...[VAR 0114(000F)]
Happy? If you’ve still got issues, kindly sort them\nout between yourselves.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Canari... Allow me to properly explain.[VAR 0114(0011)]
What Corbeau told me about the hyperspace\nthreat inspired me to offer a new training course\r\nfrom the Fist of Justice.[VAR 0114(0011)]
The people need to be prepared!\c\nWe don’t know what Pokémon might emerge\nfrom Hyperspace Lumiose next.[VAR 0114(0011)]
As such, I hope to train the people of this city so\nthey can be strong enough to handle any disaster.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Who else but Gwynn could I depend on to help\norganize such an effort? She’s so reliable![VAR 0114(0011)]
Don’t turn this around and make ME look like the\nbad guy for complainin’![VAR 0114(000F)]
Fine. Whatever. Then I’m gonna help out so G-Volt\nwon’t have to carry it all on her own! Got it?\c\nAnd I’ll bring some of Pops’s bread, too.[VAR 0114(000F)]
No objections here![VAR 0114(0011)]
Hooray. Your newfound team spirit helped you\npatch things up.\c\nNow get outta here.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Bet none of this would’ve happened if you’d just\nexplained that you’re trying to save the city.[VAR 0114(0192)]
Bah—forget it.[VAR 0114(0013)]
I’m not here to play hero.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Let’s get to business already! Here’s your\nHyperspace Lumiose update.[VAR 0114(0013)]
We combed over the data from your battle with\nthat Rogue Mega Meowstic, but it hasn’t told us\r\ntoo much about the big distortion over the tower.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Still, we’ve got a city to protect, so we can’t just\nsit around and wait. Which means...[VAR 0114(0013)]
Let me guess—time for us to knock out another\nround of surveying?[VAR 0114(0006)]
Let me guess—time for us to knock out another\nround of surveying?[VAR 0114(0005)]
I’m glad you’re quick on the uptake, kid, but I\nwouldn’t get too confident if I were you![VAR 0114(0013)]
You’re gonna keep running into stronger and\nstronger Pokémon in Hyperspace Lumiose![VAR 0114(0013)]
It’ll be OK. We’re Lumiose’s toughest trio![VAR 0114(0192)]
These ought to be of some help in your research,\n[VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(000E)]
Get out there and protect our city![VAR 0114(0013)]
Y’know, it just hit me that I call you over all the\ntime—but it’s always for the same kind of talk.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Anything worth saying is worth repeating. And if\nyou think you have all the answers, think again.[VAR 0114(0014)]
Would you say Philippe and I are rather similar in\nnature? I think I would.[VAR 0114(000E)]
[~ 114]
Fine work out there.[VAR 0114(0014)]
You’ve accumulated enough points to advance\nour research.[VAR 0114(0014)]
I’ve marked the location of a new hyperspace\ndistortion on your map.[VAR 0114(0014)]
Best of luck.[VAR 0114(0014)]
We’re counting on you![VAR 0114(0013)]
We know you can do this.[VAR 0114(0014)]
You’re doing important work. Please keep it up.[VAR 0114(000E)]
[~ 122]
An overwhelming swell of Mega Power has been\ndetected within Hyperspace Lumiose!\c\nA Pokémon inside must be about to Rogue Mega\nEvolve! Will you enter and calm it?
I’m going in now!
I need to prepare
Don’t we need a donut to make our way into\nHyperspace Lumiose?[VAR 0114(0192)]
Oh—wait one sec, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nWe’ve gotta catch the Rogue Pokémon in there,\nso make sure you’ve got room in your Boxes![VAR 0114(0192)]
Let’s go save this Pokémon from Rogue Mega\nEvolution![VAR 0114(0192)]
[~ 129]
Whoa! That’s the Legendary Pokémon Heatran!\nStay on your toes—its fiery power is intense![VAR 0114(0192)]
Yeah. It burns hot enough to even melt parts of its\nown steel body...[VAR 0114(0006)]
Yeah. It burns hot enough to even melt parts of its\nown steel body...[VAR 0114(0005)]
That’s right. Which means we can expect to be\ndodging attacks that’ll burn something fierce![VAR 0114(0192)]
I’m pretty sure Heatran is a Fire- and Steel-type\nPokémon. You ready to go up against that?[VAR 0114(0006)]
I’m pretty sure Heatran is a Fire- and Steel-type\nPokémon. You ready to go up against that?[VAR 0114(0005)]
[~ 136]
The closer we get to Heatran, the more worried I\nget that we might melt too...[VAR 0114(0192)]
But hey—it’s a good sign that we’ve found a\nLegendary Pokémon in Hyperspace Lumiose!\c\nThat means there’s hope for Ansha’s dream![VAR 0114(0192)]
The concentration of Mega Power in your vicinity\nis rising rapidly!\c\nWarning: Rogue Mega Evolution is imminent!
I’m ready to handle it!
I need to prepare
Good call taking a beat. I think our experiences up\ntill now have prepared us well, though![VAR 0114(0192)]
Pokémon like Heatran pack a TON of power into\nevery attack. We better be ready.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Pokémon like Heatran pack a TON of power into\nevery attack. We better be ready.[VAR 0114(0005)]

Mega Heatran’s fire sure packed some legendary\nlevels of power![VAR 0114(0192)]
Hello hello, Lumiose’s toughest trio. You’ve\nproven your mettle once again.[VAR 0114(0013)]
I’m buckling down for another late night—this\nRogue Mega Heatran data won’t analyze itself!\c\nThe three of you should get some rest, though.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Does anyone else get the sense that he really\nwants a pat on the back for his hard work?[VAR 0114(0192)]
I’ve gotta admit, I’m more excited about giant\nPoké Ball time than all that sciencey stuff.[VAR 0114(0192)]
Same, Korrina. I can’t wait for more butter![VAR 0114(0006)]
Same, Korrina. I can’t wait for more butter![VAR 0114(0005)]

Go on—whack it with a move![VAR 0114(0192)]
[~ 157]
The Poké Ball contained lots of Berries!
It also contained what seems to be some butter!
You obtained a pack of [VAR FF00(0008)]Hyperspace Butter[VAR FF00(0000)]!
That butter’s too majestic to be from our world.\c\nIt could only have come from here...so it’s only\nright to call it Hyperspace Butter![VAR 0114(0006)]
That butter’s too majestic to be from our world.\c\nIt could only have come from here...so it’s only\nright to call it Hyperspace Butter![VAR 0114(0005)]

[~ 164]
Hey, Ansha! We brought back some upsettingly\ngood butter![VAR 0114(0192)]
Show her the stuff, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0006)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]C’mon, [VAR 0100(0000)]—show it\nto her![VAR 0114(0005)]
You showed Ansha the Hyperspace Butter!
Goodness! One glance tells me everything.\c\nThat butter truly is out of this world. The bounty\nof hyperspace is wonderful![VAR 0114(01A5)]
The donuts I can make with it will be worth every\ndrop of your efforts.[VAR 0114(01A5)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Is tonight the night, [VAR 018B(0001)]? Shall we\nprepare the\r\ndinner we’ve been discussing?[VAR 0114(01A5)]
Yeah! I’ll get things started.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Yep! I’ll go and get started.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Our dish du jour is a treat especially for you,\nNaveen![VAR 0114(0006)]

Behold our special donut croissant curry—the\nculmination of Ansha’s dreams and mine![VAR 0114(0005)]
...Look, I’d be the first to say that Ansha’s donuts\nare a work of art.[VAR 0114(000B)]
But combining two good foods does not always\nmake a masterpiece. You two must know that.[VAR 0114(000B)]
I mean, look at it! It’s culinary chaos![VAR 0114(000B)]
Never fear![VAR 0114(01A5)]
I made these donuts especially to complement\n[VAR 018B(0001)]’s special croissant curry.[VAR 0114(01A5)]
Chef Ansha, you’ve done it again![VAR 0114(000C)]
Eating can help us build back up the energy we\nexpend battling Rogue Pokémon![VAR 0114(0192)]
Those are not battles I’ve been a part of.[VAR 0114(000B)]
C’mon, Naveen, just give it a try!\c\nYou can always start with a bite of donut, then\nwork in the curry after.[VAR 0114(0006)]
C’mon, Naveen, just give it a try!\c\nYou can always start with a bite of donut, then\nwork in the curry after.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Fine. It wouldn’t be right to let Ansha’s efforts go\nto waste.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Ansha...this is delightful! Your talent for donuts is\nremarkable.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Why, thank you! I’m no stranger to making curry\ndonuts.[VAR 0114(01A5)]
Now to try the donut together with the curry...[VAR 0114(000B)]
What IS this?![VAR 0114(000B)]
Words fail me...\c\nIt’s delicious, and yet so much more—an entire\nuniverse of flavor![VAR 0114(000B)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]As much as I hesitate to praise\n[VAR 018B(0001)]’s\r\ncooking...\r\nI must.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Has Diantha ever gotten to try one of your donuts,\nAnsha?[VAR 0114(0192)]
My dear mama? Only from my very first batch. I’m\nsure it wasn’t very good.[VAR 0114(01A5)]
I doubt that, but I guarantee she’d be over the\nmoon if she tried one of these![VAR 0114(000C)]
Perhaps...[VAR 0114(01A5)]
C’mon, Ansha, let’s eat up and get back in the\nkitchen!\c\nWe gotta perfect our curry donut recipe so your\nmom can try ’em![VAR 0114(0006)]
C’mon, Ansha, let’s eat up and get back in the\nkitchen!\c\nWe gotta perfect our curry donut recipe so your\nmom can try ’em![VAR 0114(0005)]
At this hour? Go to bed![VAR 0114(000B)]
[~ 202]
MEGA—![VAR 0114(0004)]
Did that shout come from Lida’s room?
[~ 205]
That was Lida, right?[VAR 0114(0192)]
I think so.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Why’s she shouting in the middle of the night?[VAR 0114(0006)]
What’s she doing? It’s the dead of night...[VAR 0114(0005)]
We better check on her.[VAR 0114(0192)]
Lida, we’re coming in![VAR 0114(0192)]
We gotta check on Lida![VAR 0114(0192)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Could you open the door,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0192)]
She must’ve been talking in her sleep.[VAR 0114(0006)]
She let out a real yell... I hope nothing’s wrong.[VAR 0114(0005)]
I know we heard her yell, but is it really OK to\nbarge into her room?[VAR 0114(000B)]
[~ 217]
Saw you! Saw you![VAR 0114(000C)]
Saw who? What’s she saying?[VAR 0114(0006)]
Saw who? What’s she saying?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Quick, we’ve got to check on her![VAR 0114(0192)]

Saw you! Saw you! Don’t...Mega Evolve...[VAR 0114(000C)]
Is she...sleepdancing?[VAR 0114(0006)]
Is she...sleepdancing?[VAR 0114(0005)]
We’d better wake her up.[VAR 0114(0192)]
Mega wake-up![VAR 0114(0192)]
Wha—?!\c\nWhat are you all doing in here?[VAR 0114(000C)]
We heard you shout.[VAR 0114(000B)]
What? I did what?[VAR 0114(000C)]
I must’ve been dreaming...[VAR 0114(000C)]
What kind of dream was it?
You were dancing in your sleep...
I think I was dreaming that I was at a dance\naudition.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Yeah...but it was weird. I was tiny, like I was still a\nlittle kid Ansha’s age or something.\c\nI was trying to show off my moves with Starmie,\nbut nothing was going right.\c\nThen Starmie Mega Evolved, and the judge said\nMega Evolution was off-limits![VAR 0114(000C)]
So I was frantically trying to get Starmie to undo\nits Mega Evolution...[VAR 0114(000C)]
Now that you mention it, I wonder...\c\nIf a Pokémon were to Mega Evolve outside of\nbattle, how WOULD you get it to change back?[VAR 0114(000B)]
I’m not sure, but here’s my question: Why was\nStarmie dancing along with you?[VAR 0114(0192)]
Honestly, I dunno! Maybe we’re just that in sync?\c\nWe’ve been together since I was a kid back in\nHoenn, after all.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Dreams work in mysterious ways, huh...\c\nBy the way, did you dream about someone you\nknew? You kept saying “saw you,” “saw you”...[VAR 0114(0006)]
Dreams work in mysterious ways, huh...\c\nBy the way, did you dream about someone you\nknew? You kept saying “saw you,” “saw you”...[VAR 0114(0005)]
Oh! Oh gosh... I’d totally forgotten about this, but\nback when I was a kid—and Starmie was still just\r\na Staryu—I could never pronounce its name right.\c\nIt always ended up sounding like “Saw-yu.” Guess\nI kind of reverted or something?[VAR 0114(000C)]
Ahhh, that makes sense. Kind of.\c\nWell, it’s cool you’re such a dedicated dancer that\nyou can literally do it in your sleep. But try to keep\r\nthe noise down, OK?[VAR 0114(0006)]
Ahhh, that makes sense. Kind of.\c\nWell, it’s cool you’re such a dedicated dancer that\nyou can literally do it in your sleep. But try to keep\r\nthe noise down, OK?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Sorry for the shock! And thanks for checking in\non me.[VAR 0114(000C)]

The next day...
Your alarm is going off...
[~ 2]
I had an unsettling dream. It was as if someone—\nor something—was telling me to go away...[VAR 0114(01A5)]
I had a dream like that too![VAR 0114(000C)]
If Hyperspace Lumiose is expanding and merging\nwith Lumiose, maybe it’s affecting our dreams...[VAR 0114(0192)]
Say, d’you think it’d be easier for us to find the\nPokémon that Ansha wants if we let Hyperspace\r\nLumiose swallow up our whole reality?[VAR 0114(0192)]
That might work...
No way, no how
[VAR BD06(0000)]Are you for real, [VAR 0100(0000)]?! No\nway\r\ncan\r\nwe\r\nlet\r\nthat happen![VAR 0114(000C)]
Yeah, Korrina, we can’t do that.[VAR 0114(000C)]
If the hyper-strong Pokémon from Hyperspace\nLumiose started appearing here, regular Trainers\r\nlike us wouldn’t be able to handle ’em![VAR 0114(000C)]
Sorry, Lida. I was trying to lighten things up with\na joke, but I guess it wasn’t that funny.[VAR 0114(0192)]
I appreciate that you’re still thinking of my goal,\nKorrina, even with everything else going on.[VAR 0114(01A5)]
Whoof. Guess I put my foot in my mouth so deep\nthat Ansha had to help me dig it out.[VAR 0114(0192)]
It’s odd that we haven’t heard from Corbeau yet.\nMaybe we really do need to say his name to—\c\nOops. Guess I just said it.[VAR 0114(0006)]
It’s odd that we haven’t heard from Corbeau yet.\nMaybe we really do need to say his name to—\c\nOops. Guess I just said it.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Good morning to you, Team MZ.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Sorry for the trouble, but would the team join me\nat my office? And I do mean all of you this time.[VAR 0114(0013)]
He sounded serious. That can’t mean anything\ngood.[VAR 0114(0006)]
He sounded serious. That can’t mean anything\ngood.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Guess we better get going![VAR 0114(0192)]
You should hurry on to your destination!
First a dream about Mega Starmie, then getting\ntold to stay away... What a night.[VAR 0114(000C)]
We still don’t know how we’ll take care of that\ndistortion above the tower, do we?[VAR 0114(000B)]
It seems things are really coming to a head now![VAR 0114(01A5)]
Pii hya!
[~ 27]
Wait—where ARE we?![VAR 0114(000C)]
It’s certainly not Corbeau’s office.\c\nMuch as I’d love to be wrong, I think we’re in\nHyperspace Lumiose.[VAR 0114(000B)]
But how? Hoopa didn’t open a distortion for us\nor anything![VAR 0114(0006)]
But how? Hoopa didn’t open a distortion for us\nor anything![VAR 0114(0005)]
Pii hya...
Alors, Team MZ, what is the meaning of this?[VAR 0114(0015)]
Ms. Jacinthe?![VAR 0114(01A5)]
Corbeau did warn us that Hyperspace Lumiose\ncould start merging with the real Lumiose...[VAR 0114(0192)]
That hypothetical is looking more and more like\nour reality now.[VAR 0114(0192)]
No way! We can’t let that happen![VAR 0114(000C)]
Especially not after you’ve worked so hard to\nprevent it![VAR 0114(000B)]
Easy now. Let’s all keep a cool head.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Emma! What’s your read on the situation?[VAR 0114(0006)]
Emma! What’s your read on the situation?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Let’s start with the facts.\c\nNormally, you all enter Hyperspace Lumiose using\nHoopa’s powers...[VAR 0114(0008)]
But this time, you found yourselves here without\nwarning. Right?[VAR 0114(0008)]
Right. It’s bizarre.[VAR 0114(000C)]
I’ll say. Especially since it also seems to have\naffected Jacinthe and me.[VAR 0114(0008)]
And unlike when Hoopa opens the way, there’s\nno sign of a portal back to regular Lumiose.[VAR 0114(0008)]
So I guess we need to find another way out of\nHyperspace Lumiose?[VAR 0114(0006)]
So I guess we need to find another way out of\nHyperspace Lumiose?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Hey! Did you lot take a surprise one-way trip to\nthe bizarro zone, or was it just us?[VAR 0114(0013)]
Yep, we sure did
You too, Corbeau?
Then we’re all stuck in here?! Great! Just great![VAR 0114(0013)]
Well, wandering around aimlessly isn’t going to\ndo anyone any good if we can’t find each other.\r\nYour group had better just head here, yeah?[VAR 0114(0013)]
We’re in a place that’s surrounded by walls, so\nlook for somewhere like that![VAR 0114(0013)]
Surely they are the ones who should come and\nfind us, non?[VAR 0114(0015)]
Hopefully once we meet up with Corbeau, we’ll\nbe able to find a solution.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Sounds like it’s time to hunt for somewhere\nsurrounded by walls![VAR 0114(0192)]
Corbeau said they’re in a place “surrounded by\nwalls.” He doesn’t mean a shopping arcade, right?[VAR 0114(0006)]
Corbeau said they’re in a place “surrounded by\nwalls.” He doesn’t mean a shopping arcade, right?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Haven’t been in Hyperspace Lumiose in a while.\nI see it’s just as weird and unsettling as before.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Hm. I don’t see any wild Pokémon.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Getting zapped into Hyperspace Lumiose would\nrattle anybody, huh?[VAR 0114(0192)]
No sign of that fine Legendary Pokémon...[VAR 0114(01A5)]
Pii hya.
If we’re looking for a place surrounded by walls,\nwe might have better luck searching from above.[VAR 0114(0008)]
A place surrounded by walls...[VAR BD0A(000A)]Text_icon1
Murrr-mrrrawwwr.
This is where you have all been conducting\nsurveys, correct?[VAR 0114(0015)]
I have no idea where this place is, but it’s givin’\nme a real creepy kind of déjà vu...[VAR 0114(000F)]
This here’s a fine bit of scaffolding! It’ll support\nyer weight if ya wanna make for the rooftops.[VAR 0114(0010)]
Could it be? A training ground where I can break\nanything I want without being reprimanded?\c\nHow long I’ve waited for such a place! I could\neven break that fountain right there![VAR 0114(0011)]
We’re in a place that can’t be found...[VAR 0114(0012)]
Well, at least now you know as well as I do how it\nfeels to hit a dead end.[VAR 0114(0016)]
We can’t let Lumiose become...whatever this is.\nYou and Team MZ have my help.[VAR 0114(0017)]
Grisham climbed up all this to see if he could spot\nanything from the roof.\c\nI hope it works, because I’m not a fan of this\nplace.[VAR 0114(0018)]
If I knew that this place was safe, I’d love to do\nsome research into the relationship between\r\nPokémon and Hyperspace Lumiose...\c\nBut I do value my own life.[VAR 0114(0007)]
What kind of offerings should we have on our\nmenu in a hyperspace restaurant?[VAR 0114(0032)]
Wow, I managed to reach a place that’s not on\nany map! I must be one amazing driver![VAR 0114(002F)]
Dedenne!
Dede!
There’s no one else in sight...\c\nThis is the perfect place for a marathon! There are\nno obstacles at all![VAR 0114(0030)]
I saw some scary-looking grown-ups over there...[VAR 0114(0031)]
[~ 83]
Aha. The rescue team arrives.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Looks like Lumiose is in big-time trouble again!\c\nAnyone got any good guesses as to what’s\ncausing our current predicament?[VAR 0114(0013)]
Did that distortion above the tower do this?
Is Hyperspace Lumiose’s effect growing?
That seems to be the case.\c\nTo be more precise—power appears to be building\nwithin the hyperspace distortion over the tower,\r\nand that power is distorting the real Lumiose.[VAR 0114(000E)]
Which means that not only are Pokémon from\nHyperspace Lumiose appearing in our world...\c\nbut people from the real world are also being\nwarped into Hyperspace Lumiose.[VAR 0114(0014)]
We know the most about this whole place too.\nI’d guess our subconscious minds were more\r\nsusceptible to hyperspace’s influence.[VAR 0114(0013)]
But if these powers keep growing, every person\nand Pokémon in Lumiose could end up here.[VAR 0114(000E)]
And in time, it’s possible that no one will be able\nto return to the real Lumiose.[VAR 0114(000E)]
No way...[VAR 0114(000C)]
That’s not happening![VAR 0114(000C)]
We can’t let it happen. We’ve got to protect\nLumiose![VAR 0114(0006)]
We can’t let it happen. We’ve got to protect\nLumiose![VAR 0114(0005)]
[~ 97]
Huh. Looks like we’re back.[VAR 0114(0013)]
The experience we all just shared suggests that\nHyperspace Lumiose may indeed be merging with\r\nthe real Lumiose...and it’s only just beginning.[VAR 0114(0014)]
Yeah, but how much time do we have left?\c\nRemember how Hyperspace Lumiose would get\nunstable if four or more people went in at once?[VAR 0114(0013)]
Think about how many folks we had in there just\nnow—sure didn’t look unstable to me!\c\nI’ll bet it won’t be long before every person and\nPokémon in Lumiose could get swallowed up![VAR 0114(0013)]
But we can stop it if we figure out what’s going\non with that big distortion above the tower, right?[VAR 0114(0006)]
But we can stop it if we figure out what’s going\non with that big distortion above the tower, right?[VAR 0114(0005)]
That’s the hope, yeah.[VAR 0114(0013)]
No matter what it takes, we’ll put a stop to our\nworld merging with Hyperspace Lumiose!\c\nWe didn’t work so hard to protect Lumiose just to\nwatch it turn into some nightmare zone, yeah?[VAR 0114(0013)]
Anyway, let’s get back to why I called you all here\nin the first place!\c\nWe’ve finally managed to learn something new.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Tell us everything
Amazing, Corbeau!
Flattering me won’t change what we learned,\nyou know.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Brace yourselves for this.[VAR 0114(0013)]
We’ve learned that Hyperspace Lumiose is being\ncreated and sustained by...a single Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Just one Pokémon?![VAR 0114(000C)]
What Pokémon could be capable of all this?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Well, this Pokémon spent a long time exposed to\nthe unbridled Mega Power from when the tower\r\nwent on its rampage.[VAR 0114(0013)]
That explains why the distortion above the tower\nis too intense for us to get a read on it![VAR 0114(0013)]
So all that Mega Power is causing the Pokémon\nto generate this strange other world...[VAR 0114(0192)]
It sounds like this Pokémon might go rogue!\nWe’ve got to save it and catch it![VAR 0114(0006)]
It sounds like this Pokémon might go rogue!\nWe’ve got to save it and catch it![VAR 0114(0005)]
Um... Excuse me.[VAR 0114(01A5)]
Once we save that poor Pokémon, will Hyperspace\nLumiose disappear forever...?[VAR 0114(01A5)]
If it disappears...and takes with it my dream of\ncatching the fine Legendary Pokémon I’m after...\r\nI’ll understand.[VAR 0114(01A5)]
My dream isn’t worth the suffering of everyone\nhere in Lumiose...[VAR 0114(01A5)]
That’s very thoughtful of you, kid. I’m touched.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Here’s the deal—once we handle the Pokémon\ncausing all this, Hyperspace Lumiose should\r\nfinally stop expanding.[VAR 0114(0013)]
But that doesn’t mean it’ll disappear right away.[VAR 0114(0013)]
According to our calculations, it’ll linger for a bit.\nHopefully long enough to follow your dream.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Thanks, Corbeau. And Ansha too, for being so\nunderstanding.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Thanks, Corbeau. And Ansha too, for being so\nunderstanding.[VAR 0114(0005)]
But there’s still a problem. How are we supposed\nto get to that huge distortion above the tower?\r\nEven with Hoopa’s help, it seems beyond us...[VAR 0114(0006)]
But there’s still a problem. How are we supposed\nto get to that huge distortion above the tower?\r\nEven with Hoopa’s help, it seems beyond us...[VAR 0114(0005)]
Hoo boo...
If...if only I were capable of making even better\ndonuts for you all...[VAR 0114(01A5)]
I don’t think this one’s your responsibility, Ansha.\nYour donuts have been nothing but great.[VAR 0114(000C)]
I wonder if there’s some other way to power up\nour donuts. Something we haven’t tried yet.\c\nAny ideas, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(000B)]
The power of Mega Evolution!
A Key Stone might do the trick!
[VAR BD06(0000)]Huh? What are you talking about,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(000C)]
I get it...and I think you’ve got it![VAR 0114(0192)]
We’ll feed Hoopa a donut...that we infuse with\nthe power of Mega Evolution![VAR 0114(0192)]
Huh! Hoopa may not be able to Mega Evolve, but\nI bet a donut like that would bring out some really\r\nwild power anyway![VAR 0114(0006)]
Huh! Hoopa may not be able to Mega Evolve, but\nI bet a donut like that would bring out some really\r\nwild power anyway![VAR 0114(0005)]
I rather like the idea of a Mega Donut![VAR 0114(01A5)]
Got a nice ring to it![VAR 0114(0013)]
If we combine the power of all our wonderful\nMega Evolution users, I think this ought to work![VAR 0114(01A5)]
Right. We’ll need more than Team MZ... It’s time\nto bring our ragtag crisis team back together.\c\nAnd a plan like this needs a name. We’ll call it...[VAR 0114(0013)]
Operation Mega Donut!!![VAR 0114(0013)]
Using a donut of mine to awaken a power in\nHoopa on par with Mega Evolution... Wonderful!\r\nIt will be as though we are Mega Evolving as well![VAR 0114(01A5)]
Hoo hoo!
Now that we’ve got ourselves a plan...\c\nYou know what it’s time for! Go out and survey\nHyperspace Lumiose so we can do our thing![VAR 0114(0013)]
I’m counting on you, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0013)]
Just leave everything to me!
You came to the right person!
You’re a real character, you know that?[VAR 0114(0013)]
So how ’bout that name I came up with, eh?\nOperation Mega Donut... Catchy, isn’t it?[VAR 0114(0013)]
This is quite a daring plan. You have my full\nsupport, of course.[VAR 0114(0014)]
How admirable, the way you all band together\nright away when Lumiose faces danger![VAR 0114(000E)]
Immersing a donut in Mega Power...? Well, it’s a\nbold idea for sure.[VAR 0114(000C)]
When it comes to Ansha’s donuts, nothing is\nimpossible.[VAR 0114(000B)]
The fate of Operation Mega Donut rests on\nAnsha’s and Hoopa’s shoulders![VAR 0114(0192)]
[~ 160]
Analysis complete![VAR 0114(0013)]
Thanks to your hard work, we’ve got all the data\nwe need![VAR 0114(0013)]
I’ll meet you at Hotel Z—got some info to share\nabout Operation Mega Donut.[VAR 0114(0013)]
[~ 164]
Here we are! Pardon the intrusion.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Well, isn’t this an adorable sight. Folks would eat\nthis right up.\c\nInterested in a little financial backing to turn your\nsolo stand into a global donut empire, miss chef?[VAR 0114(0013)]
Corbeau! Come on![VAR 0114(000C)]
Can’t help it. Got a nose for business\nopportunities.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Boss, I hate to say this, but it can be kind of hard\nfor others to tell when you’re joking.[VAR 0114(0014)]
Who’s joking?[VAR 0114(0013)]
Anyway! Listen up, Team MZ.[VAR 0114(0013)]
I’ve been searching for the perfect flavor profile to\ncapture all your Mega Evolution power so you can\r\ntake on the Pokémon we’re after—and I found it.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Tell ’em about the donut they need to make,\nPhilippe.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Yes, sir.\c\nWe put the whole Rust Syndicate to work coming\nup with a flavor profile we’re rather confident in.[VAR 0114(0014)]
This recipe requires you to craft a donut that\nmeets or exceeds the following Flavor Scores.[VAR 0114(0014)]
You’ll need a minimum of 310 points in sweet,\n100 points in spicy, and 310 points in sour.[VAR 0114(0014)]
It also calls for at least 40 points in bitter and\n40 points in fresh.[VAR 0114(0014)]
Lastly, you’ll need our special spice: Épice Noire.\nIt’s a signature Rust Syndicate recipe.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Those refined, tasteful little grains are the key to\nthe ultimate donut![VAR 0114(0013)]
It’s vital to Operation Mega Donut that you follow\nthese directions precisely.\c\nOnly then can you make what I’ve dubbed...the\n[VAR FF00(0006)]Bad Dreams Cruller[VAR FF00(0000)]![VAR 0114(0013)]
Once it’s made, meet us [VAR FF00(0006)]in front of the tower[VAR FF00(0000)]![VAR 0114(0013)]
He just said his piece and waltzed out. Busy guy.[VAR 0114(0006)]
He just said his piece and waltzed out. Busy guy.[VAR 0114(0005)]
I’m ready to help you make the donut we need, as\nlong as we’ve got the ingredients![VAR 0114(01A5)]
Seems like higher-level pockets of Hyperspace\nLumiose have better Hyperspace Berries.[VAR 0114(000C)]
We’ll lend this operation all the Mega Evolution\npower we can muster.[VAR 0114(000B)]
I’m ready to help you make the donut we need, as\nlong as we’ve got the ingredients![VAR 0114(01A5)]
Pii hya hya!
Kyururuuu.
So, how ’bout that donut name I came up with?\nBad Dreams Cruller... Pretty cool, yeah?[VAR 0114(0013)]
Please use the Épice Noire with care. That spice is\ntreasured for a reason.[VAR 0114(0014)]
The time when we can survey the distortion above\nthe tower is finally drawing near.[VAR 0114(000E)]
[~ 193]
Voilà![VAR 0114(01A5)]
The Bad Dreams Cruller is complete.[VAR 0114(01A5)]
When the time comes, we’ll pour as much Mega\nEvolution power into that pastry as we can.[VAR 0114(000C)]
And that’ll give Hoopa a burst of power on par\nwith Mega Evolution![VAR 0114(000B)]
Pii hya!
Then, once we get into the distortion above the\ntower, we can finally save the Pokémon in there![VAR 0114(0192)]
This is gonna work!
We can do this!
I’m counting on my main crew! Let’s do this, you\ntwo![VAR 0114(0192)]
You know it!\c\nLet’s get out to the tower. Corbeau’s waiting![VAR 0114(0006)]
You know it!\c\nLet’s get out to the tower. Corbeau’s waiting![VAR 0114(0005)]
[~ 205]
Here’s our Team MZ power trio.[VAR 0114(0013)]
It’s time to follow this distortion into Hyperspace\nLumiose and take on the Pokémon behind all this.\r\nAre you ready?[VAR 0114(0013)]
If this is what it takes to help everyone, then I’m\nready to fight![VAR 0114(0006)]
If this is what it takes to help everyone, then I’m\nready to fight![VAR 0114(0005)]
I’m the Mega Evolution successor. No way am I\ngonna say no![VAR 0114(0192)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]So I assume you’re ready as well,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0013)]
I’m all set to go!
You wanna go instead?
Not a chance.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Thought so. Guess I didn’t really need to ask.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Let’s see that [VAR FF00(0006)]Bad Dreams Cruller[VAR FF00(0000)] you made.[VAR 0114(0013)]
We can’t start the operation until you bring the\nBad Dreams Cruller I ordered.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Looks good! I knew the Rust Syndicate’s\nsignature Épice Noire would come through.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Time to roll, Philippe! Summon everyone to\nCentrico Plaza.[VAR 0114(0013)]
We can’t start the operation until you bring the\nBad Dreams Cruller I ordered.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Wait just one second. Are you planning to go in\nthere with full Boxes when you’ve got a Rogue\r\nMega-Evolved Pokémon to catch?[VAR 0114(0013)]
[~ 222]
All right, everyone. Can you see my screen? I’ve\nmarked where I want each of you.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Everyone confirm your posts, then stand by.[VAR 0114(0013)]
The plan itself I understand, but I fail to grasp why\nyou are the one giving orders.[VAR 0114(0015)]
We need our strongest Trainers working together\nif we’re gonna save Lumiose...[VAR 0114(0013)]
Especially you, Jacinthe.\c\nWouldn’t want a Trainer of your caliber stuck\nmanaging logistics. I’m just freeing you up.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Now go make Operation Mega Donut happen![VAR 0114(0013)]
[~ 229]
Harrumph! I poured my heart an’ soul into makin’\nmy Canari Bread all so some other pastry could\r\nsave the day?![VAR 0114(0010)]
Hoopa needs donuts, Pops. It’s all ringy.[VAR 0114(000F)]
Well, it’s Hoopa’s loss. Canari Bread is the best.[VAR 0114(0012)]
Aw, G-Volt...[VAR 0114(000F)]
Is this even yer post, little—uh...Gwynn, was it?[VAR 0114(0010)]
It’s fine, Pops! G-Volt can hang here. We’re buds.[VAR 0114(000F)]
More importantly—they’re seriously planning to\nMega Evolve donuts?[VAR 0114(000F)]
They are.[VAR 0114(0012)]
Hopefully we can finish before Ivor arrives.[VAR 0114(0012)]
GWYYYYYYNNNN![VAR 0114(0011)]
Where’s Gwynn?![VAR 0114(0011)]
Yeesh. Looks like Ivor’s been galumphin’ round\nthe city lookin’ for ya.[VAR 0114(0010)]
[~ 242]
Guess we’ve got to protect Lumiose. If we don’t,\nwho’ll come drink our delicious coffee?[VAR 0114(0018)]
Perhaps this is the true calling of Team Flare\nNouveau—our raison d’être.[VAR 0114(0017)]
Tch. There you go again, making everything\nexistential.[VAR 0114(0018)]
Can we just get on with the helping people?[VAR 0114(0018)]
How characteristically pragmatic, Griselle![VAR 0114(0015)]
You know, I would be overjoyed if you could bring\ndear Grisham along with you to join my upcoming\r\nmagnifique, super-deluxe tournament...[VAR 0114(0015)]
I told you, YOU come to ME if you want to battle![VAR 0114(0018)]
Lady Jacinthe, time is short. We must commence\nthe operation.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Goodness, Lebanne...[VAR 0114(0015)]
Yes, Lady Jacinthe?[VAR 0114(0016)]
You managed to successfully sneak up behind me\neven in holographic form... I am all astonishment!\r\nYou have improved considerably.[VAR 0114(0015)]
All thanks to your constant battling—er, your\nstrict guidance, Lady Jacinthe.[VAR 0114(0016)]
I suppose we’d better prepare, too.[VAR 0114(0017)]
We ARE prepared![VAR 0114(0018)]
[~ 257]
We believe in you all![VAR 0114(000C)]
Don’t worry! We’re three of the strongest Trainers\nin Lumiose![VAR 0114(0006)]
Don’t worry! We’re three of the strongest Trainers\nin Lumiose![VAR 0114(0005)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Well, Korrina and [VAR 0100(0000)]\nare,\r\nat\r\nleast.[VAR 0114(000B)]
I heard that, Naveen! You’re getting a dish of\nsome extra-special curry when we celebrate![VAR 0114(0006)]
I heard that, Naveen! You’re getting a dish of\nsome extra-special curry when we celebrate![VAR 0114(0005)]
If there’s something left to celebrate after all this,\nI’ll shovel down whatever you make.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Ansha—you can hear us, right? Make sure to\ncheer Hoopa on![VAR 0114(000C)]
I certainly will![VAR 0114(01A5)]
Good luck, all of you![VAR 0114(000C)]
Emma will be here soon. We’ll all pour all the\nMega Evolution power we’ve got into that donut.[VAR 0114(000B)]
[~ 269]
Whoa. So this is the view from on top of Prism\nTower.\c\nI knew we’d be up high, but what a sight![VAR 0114(0192)]
Can’t believe I’m up here again. This tower and I\nmust have some special bond.[VAR 0114(0006)]
The view from up here looks pretty different this\ntime.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Even looking up at this weird distorted sky, I feel\noddly calm.[VAR 0114(0192)]
I think it’s ’cause I know we’re gonna use\nAnsha’s donut and help a Pokémon in need![VAR 0114(0192)]
Indeed![VAR 0114(01A5)]
I believe in you all.[VAR 0114(01A5)]
Pii hya!
Everyone’s in position down here.[VAR 0114(0013)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]How’s it look up there,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0013)]
We’re good to go!
Give us a minute
Sorry, I’m afraid we’re all out of minutes to spare![VAR 0114(0013)]
Thought you would be.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Here goes![VAR 0114(0013)]
Let Operation Mega Donut begin![VAR 0114(0013)]
[~ 286]
This place feels weirdly familiar...[VAR 0114(0192)]
Yeah, I could swear I’ve seen it before.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Yeah, I could swear I’ve seen it before.[VAR 0114(0005)]
I had a dream about this place!
You both dreamed being here too?
Yeah, those dreams!\c\nThey must have been messages from the\nPokémon here in Hyperspace Lumiose![VAR 0114(0192)]
They sure were strange.[VAR 0114(0006)]
They sure were strange.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Yeah... “Stay away,” but also “help”?[VAR 0114(0192)]
Maybe it knows it’ll suffer if it Rogue Mega\nEvolves...[VAR 0114(0192)]
We’ve gotta press on and find that Pokémon! No,\nnot just find it—save it from Rogue Mega Evolving![VAR 0114(0192)]
I think I might know what Pokémon we’re gonna\nfind deeper in here...[VAR 0114(0192)]
What is it?[VAR 0114(0006)]
What is it?[VAR 0114(0005)]
I’m pretty sure it’s Darkrai.[VAR 0114(0192)]
It drives people and Pokémon away from itself by\nafflicting them with nightmares.[VAR 0114(0192)]
So it absorbed tons of Mega Power that the tower\nwas giving off...\c\nand now it’s afflicting us with Hyperspace\nLumiose—an out-of-this-world nightmare?[VAR 0114(0006)]
So it absorbed tons of Mega Power that the tower\nwas giving off...\c\nand now it’s afflicting us with Hyperspace\nLumiose—an out-of-this-world nightmare?[VAR 0114(0005)]
I’d say so. Though I sure don’t like it.[VAR 0114(0192)]
Thinking of the state Darkrai’s in... It makes me\nso mad![VAR 0114(0192)]
Mega Evolution is a miraculous thing.\c\nIt’s a kind of magic born from the bond between\nPokémon and Trainer, Key Stone and Mega Stone.[VAR 0114(0192)]
Rogue Mega Evolution is a cruel joke that goes\nagainst everything Mega Evolution is about!\c\nI’m the Mega Evolution successor, and I can’t sit\nby watching Pokémon suffer from it any longer![VAR 0114(0192)]
[VAR BD06(0000)][VAR 018B(0001)], [VAR 0100(0000)]...\nWe’ve\r\ngotta\r\nsave\r\nDarkrai![VAR 0114(0192)]

Hello, [VAR 018B(0001)].[VAR 0114(000A)]
A...AZ?[VAR 0114(0006)]
A...AZ?[VAR 0114(0005)]
How...[VAR 0114(0006)]
How...[VAR 0114(0005)]
This is...just a dream, huh?[VAR 0114(0006)]
This is...just a dream, huh?[VAR 0114(0005)]
It is a dream. But then again, life is a dream.[VAR 0114(000A)]
How...[VAR 0114(0006)]
How...[VAR 0114(0005)]
How could you, AZ![VAR 0114(0006)]
How could you, AZ![VAR 0114(0005)]
After everything with the tower, I came back to\nthe hotel to find you, but you were...you were...[VAR 0114(0006)]
After everything with the tower, I came back to\nthe hotel to find you, but you were...you were...[VAR 0114(0005)]
You did wonderfully.\c\nI’m so grateful for all you’ve done. You saved the\nPokémon and people of our city—and my Floette.\r\nYou truly are the worthy leader of Team MZ.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Yeah. Thanks, AZ...[VAR 0114(0006)]
Yeah. Thanks, AZ...[VAR 0114(0005)]
Kyururu.
And Korrina.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Strong as these two may be, they would have\nstruggled in hyperspace if not for you. Thank you.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Nothing to thank me for. I can’t stand to let poor\nPokémon suffer from Rogue Mega Evolution![VAR 0114(0192)]
And you, AZ... I can’t believe you had the nerve to\nkick the bucket before I made it to Lumiose![VAR 0114(0192)]
I had hoped to welcome you. But life laughs at\nour hopes, doesn’t it?[VAR 0114(000A)]
[VAR 0100(0000)]...\c\nI am so glad to have known you.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Thank you.[VAR 0114(000A)]
I’m glad we managed to meet
The time we had was precious
It warms my heart to hear you say so.\c\nAfter wandering in the dark for as long as I have,\nyour words are almost blindingly bright.[VAR 0114(000A)]
I believe in you all.\c\nNo matter how harrowing the night, I know you\nwill help shape a brighter tomorrow.[VAR 0114(000A)]

Here it comes! Watch out![VAR 0114(0192)]
[~ 357]
You’ve calmed Darkrai! Now it’s time to catch it!
[VAR 0100(0000)]! We did it![VAR 0114(0192)]
We saved Darkrai from the pain of Rogue Mega\nEvolution![VAR 0114(0192)]
We are SUCH a good team![VAR 0114(0006)]
We are SUCH a good team![VAR 0114(0005)]
You three really did it! You took care of that\nPokémon causing Hyperspace Lumiose to appear![VAR 0114(0013)]
I’ve never heard such a sunny voice out of you,\nCorbeau! You feeling good?[VAR 0114(0006)]
I’ve never heard such a sunny voice out of you,\nCorbeau! You feeling good?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Felt the need to ask the obvious, did you?[VAR 0114(0013)]
Of course I’m happy! Lumiose is safe again,\nthanks to all of you![VAR 0114(0013)]
You did great. I mean it.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Let’s head back! Can’t keep everybody waiting![VAR 0114(0192)]
[~ 370]
So the Pitch-Black Pokémon Darkrai was the one\nraging deep in Hyperspace Lumiose...[VAR 0114(0013)]
Yeah. I guess it somehow wandered into Lumiose\nand then settled on top of Prism Tower—probably\r\nto stay away from everyone down below...[VAR 0114(0192)]
No way anyone would’ve found it there while the\ntower was closed off for redevelopment.[VAR 0114(0006)]
No way anyone would’ve found it there while the\ntower was closed off for redevelopment.[VAR 0114(0005)]
But then Darkrai got exposed to all that Mega\nPower leaking from the tower...[VAR 0114(0006)]
But then Darkrai got exposed to all that Mega\nPower leaking from the tower...[VAR 0114(0005)]
So its ability to inflict nightmares got cranked up\nand ran wild—not unlike the rogue tower itself.[VAR 0114(0013)]
I guess not everything we saw was nightmarish,\nexactly. A lot of it was just...odd.[VAR 0114(0192)]
Makes sense, what with all the different people\nand Pokémon here in Lumiose.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Blend together a whole city’s worth of dreams,\nand of course you’ll get some plain old weirdness\r\nmixed in with the scary stuff.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Maybe even Darkrai can’t always tell what’s a\nnightmare to each of us.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Maybe even Darkrai can’t always tell what’s a\nnightmare to each of us.[VAR 0114(0005)]
I’m told its nightmare powers are more instinct\nthan conscious act, anyway. Darkrai may not have\r\nmeant any harm in the first place.[VAR 0114(0013)]
That’s probably true!
What matters is, it’s over!
And now![VAR 0114(0192)]
Our next task is to make sure Ansha’s dream\nbecomes a reality![VAR 0114(0192)]
You got that right.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Since we’re wrapping things up, let me say one\nlast time: Good work, kids. You’re a good bunch.[VAR 0114(0013)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]You know something,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]?\c\nYou might just be the greatest Pokémon Trainer\naround.[VAR 0114(0013)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Ah. [VAR 0100(0000)], if I might also say\na\r\nfew\r\nwords?[VAR 0114(01A5)]
I wanted to tell you how glad I am that I joined\nyou all, that I got to set up shop with you...\c\nand that we might even get to carry on together\nto meet that fine Legendary Pokémon next.[VAR 0114(01A5)]
It’s all so...so...\c\nWell, let me sum up what I mean—[VAR 0114(01A5)]
Team MZ is the best![VAR 0114(01A5)]
Aren’t we just?[VAR 0114(0006)]
You bet we are![VAR 0114(0005)]
We ARE the best team ever!
You’re all the best ever!
This city is the best ever!

The next day...
Your alarm is going off...
[~ 2]
All right, team. Time to finally make Ansha’s\ndream come true![VAR 0114(0006)]
All right, team. Time to finally make Ansha’s\ndream become reality![VAR 0114(0005)]
Where should we look?
What should we do?
That’s the question, isn’t it?\c\nI’d rather not sit around waiting for hyperspace\ndistortions to form...[VAR 0114(0006)]
That’s the question, isn’t it?\c\nIt’s no good sitting around waiting for hyperspace\ndistortions to form.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Yes, we must do more than wait![VAR 0114(01A5)]
I must ask that you please do everything you can\nto find that fine Legendary Pokémon![VAR 0114(01A5)]
Pii hya.
We will, Ansha! But maybe it’ll feel more like a\nreal job if we make it official.\c\nYour original request was for us to help you make\na donut, right? This is kinda on a whole new level.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Do we even accept requests from team members?[VAR 0114(000B)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]\nWhy wouldn’t we?\c\nI’d ask [VAR 0100(0000)] to lend a hand\nif\r\nI\r\nhad\r\na\r\nproblem.\r\nAnsha\r\nshould too![VAR 0114(000C)]
That sounds perfectly reasonable! I shall make a\nformal request of it...[VAR 0114(01A5)]
Please—catch that fine Legendary Pokémon![VAR 0114(01A5)]
Sure thing. Leave it to us![VAR 0114(0006)]
We’d be happy to take your request, Ansha![VAR 0114(0005)]
Now if only we had any leads...[VAR 0114(000B)]
Should we ask...you-know-who?[VAR 0114(000C)]
I’m sorry—why aren’t we saying his name now?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Well, you know what happens...[VAR 0114(000C)]
Look, Corbeau’s our leading Hyperspace Lumiose\nexpert. We’ll need to involve him sooner or later.\c\nWhy don’t we head to his office BEFORE he has a\nchance to call us first?[VAR 0114(0006)]
Look, Corbeau’s our leading Hyperspace Lumiose\nexpert. We’ll need to involve him sooner or later.\c\nWhy don’t we head to his office BEFORE he has a\nchance to call us first?[VAR 0114(0005)]
You all have fun!\c\nI don’t think we all need to barge in together, so\nI’ll hang back and get some training in.[VAR 0114(0192)]
I guess compared to Ansha’s dream, mine are\npretty grounded in the real world.\c\nBut let’s help make hers come true![VAR 0114(000C)]
We’re seeking out a Legendary Pokémon...\c\nEven I have to admit that it’s fairly exciting.[VAR 0114(000B)]
My heart is stirring with anticipation![VAR 0114(01A5)]
Pii hya.
Kyururu.
[~ 31]
Look who it is! Funny... I was just about to call.\c\nListen—while we were searching for Darkrai, we\ndetected some odd readings in two other places.[VAR 0114(0013)]
These readings led us to a distinctive pair of\nbrightly hued hyperspace distortions.\c\nWe’ve started referring to them by their colors:\nthe [VAR FF00(0006)]ruby distortion[VAR FF00(0000)] and the [VAR FF00(0006)]sapphire distortion[VAR FF00(0000)].[VAR 0114(0014)]
We thought reaching out to Mademoiselle Ansha\nmight be a good first step to learning more.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Your encounter with a Legendary Pokémon in\nHyperspace Lumiose kick-started this wild ride.\c\nMaybe telling us more will unearth a clue about\nhow to approach these colorful new distortions.[VAR 0114(0013)]
All right. I’ll share what I can...[VAR 0114(01A5)]
...And that’s the whole story.[VAR 0114(01A5)]
Very interesting.[VAR 0114(0013)]
I can just about guarantee that the Pokémon\nyou’re after is called [VAR FF00(0006)]Rayquaza[VAR FF00(0000)].\c\nYour description of it matches one I heard a long\ntime ago.[VAR 0114(0013)]
You sure know your stuff, Corbeau
We should’ve figured you’d know it!
Well, see, there was this one fellow who took care\nof me when I was just a little runt.[VAR 0114(0013)]
He was the boss of an organization from Kanto\nwho just happened to visit Lumiose...\c\nHe knew a lot about the myths and legends of the\nJohto and Hoenn regions.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Wait...[VAR 0114(000C)]
What is it?[VAR 0114(0013)]
Are we talking about, like, THE Rayquaza? From\nthe Hoenn region?[VAR 0114(000C)]
What, you think there’re other Rayquaza flying\naround out there?[VAR 0114(0013)]
I mean, not really. I’m just surprised.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Look, I’m just telling you what I heard. Keep in\nmind it’s all secondhand info from years ago.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Actually—you could probably tell us more about\nRayquaza yourself. You’re from Hoenn, yeah?[VAR 0114(0013)]
Oh. Yeah, I am. Sure![VAR 0114(000C)]
Back in Hoenn, we’ve got these old legends—I’m\ntalking REAL old.[VAR 0114(000C)]
They tell of two Legendary Pokémon.\c\nThe first is Kyogre, maker of oceans...[VAR 0114(000C)]
Then there’s Groudon, maker of land.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Kyogre and Groudon were locked in this fierce\nbattle...\c\nApparently it was the Legendary Pokémon\nRayquaza that put a stop to the fighting.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Quite right, Lida! How wonderful to find another\nRayquaza enthusiast. We should swap notes later.[VAR 0114(01A5)]
Huh? I mean, sure—we can do that, I guess...[VAR 0114(000C)]
Here’s what I’m thinking.[VAR 0114(0013)]
I’m pretty sure these new distortions are linked to\nKyogre and Groudon. And dealing with those two\r\nmight lead us to Rayquaza![VAR 0114(0013)]
According to our calculations, you’ll need special\ndonuts to reach the pockets of Hyperspace\r\nLumiose in which Kyogre and Groudon dwell.[VAR 0114(0014)]
Just like how you found Darkrai, eh?\c\nIn that case, you know what you’ve gotta do.\nConsider this your official survey request![VAR 0114(0013)]
Ah, but don’t go yet—I forgot one thing.[VAR 0114(0013)]
We’ve started picking up some distortions with\nRogue Mega-Evolved Pokémon you’ve already\r\nbattled and calmed before.\c\nCouldn’t tell you why... Maybe it’s your own\nsubconscious memories influencing things?[VAR 0114(0013)]
Anyway—these Rogue Pokémon are dangerous,\nbut beating ’em would yield lots of survey points.[VAR 0114(0013)]
That’s all from me. Good luck out there![VAR 0114(0013)]
You’ll need to make the right donut in order to\nenter this distortion!
Do your best. Can’t go letting the little lady down![VAR 0114(0013)]
We are truly grateful for Team MZ’s dedication.[VAR 0114(0014)]
As long as we can avoid undue risk, I fully support\nexploring the possibilities of Hyperspace Lumiose.[VAR 0114(000E)]
So it was Rayquaza that Ansha’s been after, huh?\c\nShe sure plays her cards close to the chest, not\ntelling us its name until she was completely sure.[VAR 0114(0192)]
Seems like there’s unlimited possibilities in\nHyperspace Lumiose![VAR 0114(0006)]
It seems like the possibilities in Hyperspace\nLumiose are unlimited![VAR 0114(0005)]
[~ 73]
Great work out there.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Thanks to you completing those survey tasks,\nwe’ve made some leaps in our analysis![VAR 0114(0013)]
Piece of cake!
I did my best
Guess this survey stuff comes second nature to\nyou now, eh? Team MZ doesn’t mess around.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Would you meet me at Nouveau Café? I’ve got a\nfew things that’d be easier to discuss in person.[VAR 0114(0013)]
The main Nouveau Café at Centrico Plaza, that is!\c\nDon’t go blowing up my phone asking where I am\nfrom one of their little side trucks![VAR 0114(0013)]
You should hurry on to your destination!
[~ 82]
Glad you could join us.[VAR 0114(0014)]
Why don’t we order something before we get\ndown to business?[VAR 0114(0013)]
A good bite is a sure path to a happier day, don’t\nyou think?[VAR 0114(0013)]
As long as it’s shared with someone you feel\ncomfortable with, of course.[VAR 0114(0013)]
What do you want?[VAR 0114(0018)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]The usual\n[VAR 01CF(0002)]\r\nfor\r\nyou,\r\n[VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0018)]
Drip coffee for me. And one of those great\ncroissants Grisham makes.[VAR 0114(0013)]
That’s it? What, is the Rust Syndicate pinching\npennies now? Disappointing.[VAR 0114(0018)]
Ah, Prism Tower... Still the symbol of our city, for\nbetter or worse.[VAR 0114(0013)]
You can see it from anywhere in Lumiose—that’s\nwhy it needs to be fixed up as soon as possible.[VAR 0114(0013)]
That said, I still appreciate the effort you made to\nprotect it. Even if it did end up like that.[VAR 0114(0013)]
This city is worth protecting
We all pulled it off together
Sure—but just know I appreciate it.\c\nAfter all, sometimes the things that obviously\nneed doing are the hardest to actually do.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Anyway, let’s get down to business.[VAR 0114(0013)]
To get into the pockets of Hyperspace Lumiose on\nthe other side of the [VAR FF00(0006)]ruby distortion[VAR FF00(0000)] and [VAR FF00(0006)]sapphire[VAR FF00(0000)]\r\n[VAR FF00(0006)]distortion[VAR FF00(0000)], you’ll need some special donut recipes.[VAR 0114(0013)]
We put the entire Rust Syndicate through their\npaces researching and developing new recipes.[VAR 0114(0014)]
Easy, Philippe.\c\nCalling too much attention to our hard work could\ncome across like you just want a pat on the back.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Let’s keep it humble. We’re all doing our best for\neveryone in Lumiose here.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Pardon me, boss. Didn’t mean to be gauche.\c\nI was merely inspired by the noble tales you keep\nrelating to us about the many sleepless nights\r\nyou’ve spent analyzing all this hyperspace data.[VAR 0114(0014)]
We’ll send word to Ansha about the flavor profiles\nyour donuts will need.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Be warned—you’ll also need one particularly rare\ningredient.[VAR 0114(0014)]
And what would that be?
I’ll get anything we need!
Don’t worry. I’ve got this one.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Grish, pal?[VAR 0114(0013)]
Think you could spare some of that Hoennian Salt\nyou sprinkle on your croissants?[VAR 0114(0013)]
How did you know our secret ingredient?[VAR 0114(0017)]
I suppose it’s true what they say about the Rust\nSyndicate.\c\nYou really do go digging up everything you can\nabout people to hold as leverage...[VAR 0114(0017)]
Nonsense! We’d never stoop so low. Privacy’s\nparamount these days.[VAR 0114(0013)]
We figured out your secret ingredient thanks to\nPhilippe’s perceptive palate!\c\nDon’t underestimate Restaurant Le Wow’s\nfavorite taste tester![VAR 0114(0013)]
Very well. I did overhear your talk, and I can share\nour riches if you’re working on the city’s behalf.[VAR 0114(0017)]
Please use this well. It’s terribly valuable.[VAR 0114(0017)]
Much obliged![VAR 0114(0013)]
I’ve sent Ansha the flavor profile data.[VAR 0114(0014)]
Well, with that, I think the rest is up to you.\c\nI hereby leave the matter of Kyogre and Groudon\nin Team MZ’s capable hands![VAR 0114(0013)]
[~ 119]
Hello. I was just reviewing the recipes Mr. Philippe\nsent me.[VAR 0114(01A5)]
They will be quite complex—like the one we used\nto find that fine Pokémon Darkrai.[VAR 0114(01A5)]
It’s rather intriguing that the key to meeting two\nLegendary Pokémon of Hoenn is...Hoennian Salt.\c\nQuite a tidy solution, is it not?[VAR 0114(01A5)]
I guess it makes a lot of sense
I think it’s a little on the nose
Indeed. Simplicity is often best.[VAR 0114(01A5)]
Perhaps, but isn’t simplicity often for the best?[VAR 0114(01A5)]
So what kind of donuts are we gonna make?[VAR 0114(0006)]
So what kind of donuts are we gonna make?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Well, paying a visit to Groudon calls for a very\nparticular flavor profile.[VAR 0114(01A5)]
We’ll need at least 260 points in sweet, 160 in\nspicy, 160 in sour, 20 in bitter, and 260 in fresh.[VAR 0114(01A5)]
That will make us an [VAR FF00(0006)]Omega Old-Fashioned Donut[VAR FF00(0000)]\nfor visiting Groudon in Hyperspace Lumiose.[VAR 0114(01A5)]
And dropping in on Kyogre will take a donut with\nits own unique flavor profile.[VAR 0114(01A5)]
We’ll need at least 50 points in sweet, 50 in spicy,\n210 in sour, 180 in bitter, and 370 in fresh.[VAR 0114(01A5)]
That should yield an [VAR FF00(0006)]Alpha Old-Fashioned Donut[VAR FF00(0000)]\nwith which to visit Kyogre’s pocket of hyperspace.[VAR 0114(01A5)]
I’ll be counting on all of you to help gather the\nnecessary ingredients![VAR 0114(01A5)]
Meeting Legendary Pokémon takes some pretty\nincredible donuts![VAR 0114(000C)]
The entire Rust Syndicate working to develop new\ndonut recipes... I’m curious what that looks like.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Kyururu.
[~ 139]
We’ve done it! This is one of my finest works yet![VAR 0114(01A5)]
Behold the [VAR FF00(0006)]Omega Old-Fashioned Donut[VAR FF00(0000)]![VAR 0114(01A5)]
Way to go, Chef Ansha![VAR 0114(000C)]
I doubt anyone could work Berries into such\nartistic donut creations as you.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Now Hoopa can get us into the pocket of\nHyperspace Lumiose where Groudon is at![VAR 0114(0006)]
Now Hoopa can get us into the pocket of\nHyperspace Lumiose where Groudon is at![VAR 0114(0005)]
Please make good use of it! I’m sure gathering\nthe ingredients was no easy task.[VAR 0114(01A5)]
Let’s head to [VAR FF00(0006)]Jaune Sector 11[VAR FF00(0000)]. I’m pretty sure\nKorrina will be there waiting for us![VAR 0114(0006)]
Let’s head to [VAR FF00(0006)]Jaune Sector 11[VAR FF00(0000)]. I’m pretty sure\nKorrina will be there waiting for us![VAR 0114(0005)]
It’s odd hearing so much talk about Hoenn’s\nLegendary Pokémon out here in Lumiose.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Ansha’s donuts seem capable of—well, anything.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Kyururu.
[~ 152]
We’ll need that [VAR FF00(0006)]Omega Old-Fashioned Donut[VAR FF00(0000)] to\nget through this ruby distortion, yeah?[VAR 0114(0192)]
Strong signals detected from within this pocket of\nHyperspace Lumiose!\c\nA Pokémon inside is likely about to Mega Evolve!\nWill you enter and calm it?
I’m going in now!
I need to prepare
I think Groudon’s gonna go through Primal\nReversion, not Mega Evolution. But still![VAR 0114(0192)]
Go ahead and feed Hoopa that [VAR FF00(0006)]Omega Old-[VAR FF00(0000)]\n[VAR FF00(0006)]Fashioned Donut[VAR FF00(0000)], [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0192)]
If you don’t have the right donut, then we can’t\nuse this distortion to get to Hyperspace Lumiose.[VAR 0114(0192)]
Listen, you can’t go in there with full Boxes.\nYou’re gonna have to catch Groudon![VAR 0114(0192)]
[~ 161]
So, this is Groudon’s world![VAR 0114(0192)]
Come quick, you two![VAR 0114(0192)]
Ginormous red crystals... Lava pouring down...\nThis is what it’s like in Groudon’s subconscious?[VAR 0114(0006)]
Ginormous red crystals... Lava pouring down...\nThis is what it’s like in Groudon’s subconscious?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Yeah, I guess so. I’m no expert here...\c\nWhat I do know is that Groudon should gain the\nFire type when it undergoes Primal Reversion![VAR 0114(0192)]
Good to know. Though I doubt just using Water\ntypes will cut it against an opponent like this.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Good to know. Though I doubt just using Water\ntypes will cut it against an opponent like this.[VAR 0114(0005)]
If the three of us all work together, we can do it!\nWe can catch Groudon![VAR 0114(0192)]
Well, I don’t see any other option but to trust in\nour Rotom Phones and take the plunge...[VAR 0114(0006)]
Well, I don’t see any other option but to trust in\nour Rotom Phones and take the plunge...[VAR 0114(0005)]
Guess we’ve gotta drop down again if we wanna\nbattle Groudon![VAR 0114(0006)]
Guess we’ve gotta drop down again if we wanna\nbattle Groudon![VAR 0114(0005)]
Let’s get to it![VAR 0114(0192)]
[~ 175]
I didn’t expect the Legendary Pokémon Groudon\nto look so...stiff.[VAR 0114(0006)]
I didn’t expect the Legendary Pokémon Groudon\nto look so...stiff.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Watch it! I don’t think it’s staying still for long![VAR 0114(0192)]
[~ 179]
It’s time to catch Groudon.
YES, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0192)]
And you too, [VAR 018B(0001)]! Way to go![VAR 0114(0192)]
We’re just too good![VAR 0114(0006)]
We’re just too good![VAR 0114(0005)]
Not bad, kids![VAR 0114(0013)]
Lumiose’s toughest trio has done it again![VAR 0114(0013)]
Now, while I’m sure you’re still enjoying the glow\nof victory, I’ve got some questions.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Come by my office![VAR 0114(0013)]
[~ 189]
You three actually caught Groudon. Amazing.[VAR 0114(0013)]
I know Groudon’s got that special Red Orb, but I\nwas wondering...[VAR 0114(0013)]
How’s it different from a Mega Stone?[VAR 0114(0013)]
Ah. I forgot to explain it to you, Corbeau.[VAR 0114(0192)]
What Groudon did is called Primal Reversion![VAR 0114(0192)]
Its Red Orb contains an overwhelming amount of\nnatural energy.[VAR 0114(0192)]
When the power in the Red Orb returns Groudon\nto its true form, that’s Primal Reversion.[VAR 0114(0192)]
I’ve studied it a little, since it kinda resembles\nMega Evolution in some ways.\c\nBut there’s not much info about Primal Reversion\nout there.[VAR 0114(0192)]
Sounds like this trip gave you some good data too,\nMs. Mega Stones.[VAR 0114(0013)]
In any case, you’re not done yet. Get working on\nthat other distortion so you can catch Kyogre![VAR 0114(0013)]
You bet we will! We’ve gotta make Ansha’s\ndream come true![VAR 0114(0192)]
We’re Team MZ. We got this![VAR 0114(0006)]
We’re Team MZ. We got this![VAR 0114(0005)]
[~ 203]
We’ve done it! I’ve never made a donut quite like\nthis one before![VAR 0114(01A5)]
Behold the [VAR FF00(0006)]Alpha Old-Fashioned Donut[VAR FF00(0000)]![VAR 0114(01A5)]
Way to go, Chef Ansha![VAR 0114(000C)]
Truly, we’ve got the most dedicated donut chef in\nall of Lumiose.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Now Hoopa can get us into the pocket of\nHyperspace Lumiose where Kyogre is at![VAR 0114(0006)]
Now Hoopa can get us into the pocket of\nHyperspace Lumiose where Kyogre is at![VAR 0114(0005)]
I trust you’ll use it well! You worked so hard to\ngather the ingredients, after all.[VAR 0114(01A5)]
Let’s head to [VAR FF00(0006)]Wild Zone 5[VAR FF00(0000)]. I bet Korrina will be\nthere waiting for us![VAR 0114(0006)]
Let’s head to [VAR FF00(0006)]Wild Zone 5[VAR FF00(0000)]. I bet Korrina will be\nthere waiting for us![VAR 0114(0005)]
It’s odd hearing so much talk about Hoenn’s\nLegendary Pokémon out here in Lumiose.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Ansha’s donuts seem capable of—well, anything.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Kyururu.
[~ 216]
We’ll need an [VAR FF00(0006)]Alpha Old-Fashioned Donut[VAR FF00(0000)] to get\nthrough the sapphire distortion here.[VAR 0114(0192)]
Strong signals detected from within this pocket of\nHyperspace Lumiose!\c\nA Pokémon inside is likely about to Mega Evolve!\nWill you enter and calm it?
I’m going in now!
I need to prepare
Teeechnically, I think Kyogre’s gonna go through\nPrimal Reversion, not Mega Evolution. But still![VAR 0114(0192)]
Go ahead and feed Hoopa that [VAR FF00(0006)]Alpha Old-[VAR FF00(0000)]\n[VAR FF00(0006)]Fashioned Donut[VAR FF00(0000)], [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0192)]
If you don’t have the right donut, then we can’t\nuse that distortion to get to Hyperspace Lumiose.[VAR 0114(0192)]
Listen, you can’t go in there with full Boxes.\nYou’re gonna have to catch Kyogre![VAR 0114(0192)]
[~ 225]
So this is where Kyogre dwells![VAR 0114(0192)]
C’mere, you two. Check this out![VAR 0114(0192)]
Huge blue crystals... Waterfalls from nowhere...\nIs this what Kyogre’s subconscious looks like?[VAR 0114(0006)]
Huge blue crystals... Waterfalls from nowhere...\nIs this what Kyogre’s subconscious looks like?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Well, they do say Kyogre is the personification of\nthe sea.\c\nThe strength of its Water-type attacks is supposed\nto be incredible![VAR 0114(0192)]
We can still take it on between the three of us\nand our Pokémon![VAR 0114(0006)]
We can still take it on between the three of us\nand our Pokémon![VAR 0114(0005)]
And our bonds with each other make us strong—\njust like how our bonds with our Pokémon let\r\nthem Mega Evolve![VAR 0114(0192)]
Guess we’ve gotta trust in our Rotom Phones and\ntake the plunge...[VAR 0114(0006)]
Guess we’ve gotta trust in our Rotom Phones and\ntake the plunge...[VAR 0114(0005)]
If we’re gonna battle Kyogre, guess it’s time for\nanother big drop.[VAR 0114(0006)]
If we’re gonna battle Kyogre, guess it’s time for\nanother big drop.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Let’s go, everyone. Time to catch Kyogre![VAR 0114(0192)]
[~ 239]
Whoa... Is that Kyogre?[VAR 0114(0006)]
Whoa... Is that Kyogre?[VAR 0114(0005)]
We can’t pull any punches! Gloves up, team![VAR 0114(0192)]
[~ 243]
It’s time to catch Kyogre.
Way to GO, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0006)]
Way to GO, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0005)]
You and me and Korrina together... Man![VAR 0114(0006)]
You and me and Korrina... We’re unstoppable![VAR 0114(0005)]
Yeah! We’re the greatest![VAR 0114(0192)]
I can’t believe we caught Kyogre. Lumiose’s\ntoughest trio comes through once again![VAR 0114(0192)]
Excellent work, kids.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Beating Kyogre is no joke—especially after it got\neven more powerful![VAR 0114(0013)]
But as much as I hate to interrupt your moment...[VAR 0114(0013)]
I need you all to stop by my office! I’ll be waiting.[VAR 0114(0013)]
[~ 255]
You three didn’t just beat Kyogre—you beat it\nwhen it was powered up. You sure are something.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Whatever Kyogre did with that Blue Orb didn’t\nsound quite like it was Mega Evolving, though.[VAR 0114(0013)]
So let me get this straight—there’s both Primal\nReversion AND Mega Evolution in play here?[VAR 0114(0013)]
You got it! They sorta work in a similar way, but\nthey’re not exactly the same. Funny, right?[VAR 0114(0192)]
Primal Reversion is when Kyogre returns to its\noriginal state and grows really powerful.[VAR 0114(0192)]
Its Blue Orb contains an overwhelming amount of\nnatural energy.[VAR 0114(0192)]
When that energy—the orb’s power—awakens\nKyogre’s true form, it becomes Primal Kyogre.[VAR 0114(0192)]
Glad I got to see Primal Reversion for myself. It’s a\nbig deal for me as the Mega Evolution successor![VAR 0114(0192)]
I’m glad this gave you something new to chew on.[VAR 0114(0013)]
But you’re not done yet. Get working on that ruby\ndistortion so you can catch Groudon![VAR 0114(0013)]
You bet we will. We can’t let Ansha down![VAR 0114(0192)]
That’s right. Our donut chef deserves the best![VAR 0114(0006)]
That’s right. Our donut chef deserves the best![VAR 0114(0005)]
[~ 269]
You caught Groudon AND Kyogre—two legends of\nthe Hoenn region!\c\nI know it couldn’t have been easy. Well done![VAR 0114(0013)]
Looks like it’s finally time for us to track down\nRayquaza.[VAR 0114(0013)]
We’ll be finished analyzing the Blue Orb and the\nRed Orb soon.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Seems like data analysis is the Rust Syndicate’s\nmain job now. What kind of organization are we\r\nthese days—a civic think tank?[VAR 0114(0013)]
You’re Lumiose’s reliable allies!
You’re...volunteer do-gooders?
Ha. Don’t forget who you’re dealing with, kid.\c\nOnce folks are in our debt, we can put ’em to\nwork for free...helping us shape Lumiose just\r\nthe way we want it. That’s all.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Sorry for the wait.[VAR 0114(0014)]
Allow me to return your Blue Orb and Red Orb.[VAR 0114(0014)]
You were quite right about the prodigious energy\nthey contain, Ms. Korrina.[VAR 0114(0014)]
I believe someone else wanted to weigh in, too...\nWhat do you have to say, Professor Mable?[VAR 0114(0013)]
Uh... I’m the lab’s acting director, not a professor![VAR 0114(0007)]
I did NOT ask for students![VAR 0114(0007)]
I understand, Professor. Could you tell us what\nyou’ve learned?[VAR 0114(0013)]
You little...\c\n...Fine. Let me sum up what we know.[VAR 0114(0007)]
Our inciting incident is when Darkrai got pumped\nfull of all that Mega Power oozing from the tower.[VAR 0114(0007)]
Long story short, its nightmare-generating powers\nskyrocketed and Hyperspace Lumiose was born.[VAR 0114(0007)]
The makeup of Hyperspace Lumiose reflects the\nsubconscious thoughts of people and Pokémon...\r\nwhich I guess is why it’s so weird in there.\c\nBut you’ve already figured that much out on your\nown, haven’t you?[VAR 0114(0007)]
Let me clarify one thing, though. It’s not JUST a\nreflection of subconscious thoughts—it’s dreams.\c\nAnd I mean dreams of all kinds—both the ones\nyou can’t control at night and the things you’re\r\nactively wanting and wishing for.[VAR 0114(0007)]
Great lesson, Professor. Bravo.\c\nNow could you tell us how we can find Rayquaza?[VAR 0114(0013)]
You’ll have to generate Rayquaza’s realm of\nHyperspace Lumiose by actualizing a related\r\naspect of the subconscious as a basis.[VAR 0114(0007)]
Actualizing...what?[VAR 0114(0013)]
Can you slow down and try that again for the less\neggheaded among us?[VAR 0114(0013)]
You. Have. To. Wish. Really. Hard.[VAR 0114(0007)]
I think it might be doable now that you’ve caught\nboth Primal Groudon and Primal Kyogre.[VAR 0114(0007)]
Getting closer to your goal is probably making it\neasier to picture catching Rayquaza—and that’s\r\nmade you even more motivated. I’m right, aren’t I?[VAR 0114(0007)]
So take that mental image and that motivation...\nthen dial ’em up and make it happen.[VAR 0114(0007)]
I get it...I think? Not sure if that helped or made\nthings even more confusing.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Look, buster.[VAR 0114(0007)]
My job is studying Pokémon energy!\c\nI’m not automatically a hyperspace expert just\nbecause I have a fancy lab at my disposal![VAR 0114(0007)]
Who’s the big dreamer trying to get a meet and\ngreet with Rayquaza in the first place, anyway?[VAR 0114(0007)]
It’s Ansha
It’s Corbeau
Was that your idea of a joke?! Good one, kid!\nLook how hard we’re all laughing![VAR 0114(0013)]
That’s right—the little chef herself![VAR 0114(0013)]
I suggest you listen to the professor’s NON-expert\nopinion, [VAR 0100(0000)].\c\nYou gotta get Ansha to wish as hard as she can\nfor you to encounter Rayquaza![VAR 0114(0013)]
I’ll get on it
What? How?
Maybe try digging deeper into why she wants to\nmeet Rayquaza so much in the first place.[VAR 0114(0013)]
That little lady sure is something.[VAR 0114(0013)]
She wanted to meet this mighty Pokémon so bad\nthat her dream got mixed up with Darkrai’s power\r\nto make nightmares...and look where we are now.[VAR 0114(0013)]
That’s one heck of a powerful dream.[VAR 0114(0013)]
But back to the topic at hand... Thanks, Professor.\nI’ll call again if we need you.[VAR 0114(0013)]
The next time you call me will be your last.[VAR 0114(0007)]
I’ll get Ansha caught up on all this![VAR 0114(0192)]
Go do your thing, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0013)]
[~ 316]
Hey, welcome back![VAR 0114(000C)]
Where’s Ansha?
Where’s Korrina?
Both Ansha and Korrina are in Korrina’s room.[VAR 0114(000B)]
As soon as Korrina got back, she told Ansha what\nthe three of you learned from the Rust Syndicate.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Then Ansha asked to hear all about your battles\nwith Groudon and Kyogre.\c\nSo Korrina said she’d tell the whole story in\n“mega detail” or something.[VAR 0114(000C)]
It was rather hard to follow it all. Care to fill us in\ndirectly on what you were told by Corbeau?[VAR 0114(000B)]
So...the reason Ansha wanted to hear more about\nyour battles with Kyogre and Groudon was so that\r\nshe could imagine you catching Rayquaza next?[VAR 0114(000C)]
That seems likely. She’s probably hoping to\nreinforce that dream of hers in finer detail.[VAR 0114(000B)]
I guess a little visualization can go a long way.[VAR 0114(0006)]
I guess a little visualization can go a long way.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Is any of that really necessary, though?[VAR 0114(000C)]
What do you mean?[VAR 0114(000B)]
I mean, Ansha’s wish was already plenty strong.\nThat’s how she found Rayquaza in the first place.[VAR 0114(000C)]
I suppose so...but there’s no harm in letting her\ncontinue what she started, is there?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Hey, the gang’s all here![VAR 0114(0192)]
I’m newly impressed—not just by the sheer\nwonder of Hyperspace Lumiose but by all of you.\r\nAnd the Legendary Pokémon you battled too![VAR 0114(01A5)]
So you heard the whole story from Korrina?[VAR 0114(000C)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Indeed! Ms. Korrina told me all about your\nhyperspace exploits, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(01A5)]
I can picture the noble Kyogre and the grand\nGroudon in perfect detail![VAR 0114(01A5)]
So I’m quite confident I’ll be able to imagine the\npocket of Hyperspace Lumiose where we’ll find\r\nthe fine Rayquaza at last![VAR 0114(01A5)]
OK. Now that you’ve got a good mental image,\nlet’s put some real oomph behind it!\c\nAnsha, how ’bout you remind us why you wanna\nmeet Rayquaza so much?[VAR 0114(000C)]
All right, I’ll tell you everything from the start![VAR 0114(01A5)]
Is here good enough?
Let’s go to the roof!
Huh? Why wouldn’t it be?[VAR 0114(000C)]
Nice thinking! Rayquaza’s the Sky High Pokémon,\nafter all. It’ll be easier to imagine from up high![VAR 0114(0192)]
I gotcha. Rayquaza’s the Sky High Pokémon, so\nwe should do this higher up—closer to the sky![VAR 0114(0192)]
Sounds good. Let’s go roof it up![VAR 0114(0006)]
Sounds good. Let’s go roof it up![VAR 0114(0005)]
[~ 347]
Hey, this roof is where you first showed up too—\nright, Ansha?[VAR 0114(0006)]
Hey, this roof is where you first showed up too—\nright, Ansha?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Indeed. Hoopa transported me here![VAR 0114(01A5)]
Pii hya hya!
Hoopa sure picked the right roof!\c\nNo one else but Team MZ could’ve handled this\nhyperspace stuff so well![VAR 0114(0006)]
Hoopa sure picked the right roof!\c\nNo one else but Team MZ could’ve handled this\nhyperspace stuff so well![VAR 0114(0005)]
OK, Ansha. Tell us again—why do you want to\nmeet Rayquaza? Give us the details so we can all\r\npicture it crystal clear![VAR 0114(0192)]
All right. It all begins with a story that I love very\ndearly. Listen close, and I’ll tell it to you.[VAR 0114(01A5)]
A long, long time ago, in what people call the\nprimal age...[VAR 0114(01A5)]
the world was overflowing with natural energy.[VAR 0114(01A5)]
In that time there was Primal Kyogre, bolstered by\nthe power within the Blue Orb...[VAR 0114(01A5)]
So too was there Primal Groudon, with the might\nof the Red Orb at its beck and call.[VAR 0114(01A5)]
They fought over the world’s natural energy in\nendless, furious clashes.[VAR 0114(01A5)]
When Primal Groudon roared, the earth began to\nswell and the waters were evaporated into dust.[VAR 0114(01A5)]
When Primal Kyogre bellowed, torrential waters\nflowed and massive downpours eroded the earth.[VAR 0114(01A5)]
For 20 days, these two mighty Pokémon battled\nfrom sunup to sundown. The ferocity of their\r\nclashing scarred and warped the world itself.[VAR 0114(01A5)]
The people of that age—the Draconids—were at a\nloss. Whatever could they do?\c\nThey wished with all their might for Rayquaza to\ndescend and save them from destruction...[VAR 0114(01A5)]
The Draconids’ wishes must have reached\nRayquaza...[VAR 0114(01A5)]
There appeared before Primal Kyogre and Primal\nGroudon a dazzling light—and in it was Rayquaza\r\nin a sublime and incredible form.[VAR 0114(01A5)]
A blazing light and whipping wind sapped the\npower from Groudon and Kyogre alike.\c\nRobbed of their Primal forms, they fled to the\nfaraway depths of land and sea.[VAR 0114(01A5)]
The Draconids came to revere Rayquaza as a true\nsavior.\c\nAnd there our story ends![VAR 0114(01A5)]
I still can’t believe we’re actually meeting Hoenn’s\nLegendary Pokémon—in Lumiose, of all places.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Incredible, isn’t it?[VAR 0114(01A5)]
That part about Rayquaza’s “sublime form” sounds\nan awful lot like Mega Evolution.[VAR 0114(0192)]
Rayquaza’s supposedly got something in its body\ncalled a “mikado organ” that has the same power\r\nas a Mega Stone.\c\nThat means Rayquaza can Mega Evolve into\nMega Rayquaza all on its own.[VAR 0114(0192)]
A Pokémon that can undergo Mega Evolution\nwithout needing a Mega Stone? Wow.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Yeah—Rayquaza’s Mega Evolution is crazy strong!\nI totally get why you wanna meet it so bad, Ansha.[VAR 0114(000C)]
My dear mama read me that story quite often.\c\nI came to love the story—and admire Rayquaza—\nso much that I would dream about it.[VAR 0114(01A5)]
Isn’t it noble? Rayquaza, savior of the Draconids![VAR 0114(01A5)]
I can see why you’d want to get it for Diantha.\nA mighty Pokémon for a mighty mom, huh?[VAR 0114(0006)]
I can see why you’d want to get it for Diantha.\nA mighty Pokémon for a mighty mom, huh?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Your love for Rayquaza sounds like the real deal,\nAnsha.\c\nI’m sure your dream will be strong enough to\ncreate the hyperspace distortion we need![VAR 0114(0192)]
WHA—?![VAR 0114(000C)]
I guess that actually worked?![VAR 0114(000B)]
[~ 382]
We’ve managed to gather some data on this latest\ndistortion.[VAR 0114(0014)]
The signals we’ve detected coming from this\ndistortion are on wavelengths very similar to\r\nthose emitted by the Blue Orb and the Red Orb.[VAR 0114(0014)]
We believe this distortion leads to the location in\nHyperspace Lumiose where you’ll find Rayquaza.[VAR 0114(0014)]
At last...I’ll be able to see the fine Rayquaza again![VAR 0114(01A5)]
Guess we’re about to witness a dream coming\ntrue![VAR 0114(000C)]
We sure are!
We just might
One more thing.\c\nMuch like with Kyogre and Groudon, this special\ndistortion requires a special donut to match.[VAR 0114(0014)]
Please, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nGather lots of data so Mr. Philippe and his team\ncan develop the perfect recipe for us![VAR 0114(01A5)]
When you do, I’ll make the mightiest donut of all![VAR 0114(01A5)]
I know I won’t fail...because I’ve got all of you on\nmy side![VAR 0114(01A5)]
I wonder if Hyperspace Berries grow anywhere\nother than hyperspace...[VAR 0114(000C)]
So many unbelievable things have happened that\nI’m not sure anything can surprise me anymore.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Kyururu.
[~ 397]
Fine work out there.[VAR 0114(0014)]
You’ve accumulated enough data for us to learn\nall we needed.[VAR 0114(0014)]
We now have a recipe for a donut that will allow\nyou to find Rayquaza in Hyperspace Lumiose.[VAR 0114(0014)]
We also have one more thing to give you. Please\nmeet us at Hotel Z when you can.[VAR 0114(0014)]
[~ 402]
At last, we’ll have the recipe! I’ll be able to make a\ndonut that will lead the way to Rayquaza![VAR 0114(01A5)]
Do we have to wait for Mr. Corbeau? Couldn’t we\ngo to the Rust Syndicate and ask them to tell us\r\nwhat we need to know?[VAR 0114(01A5)]
Settle down, Ansha! Let’s be patient.\c\nThough, hang on—Corbeau? Is he coming?\nPhilippe’s the only one who usually shows.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Oh, am I not welcome?[VAR 0114(0013)]
Hello, [VAR 0100(0000)] and Ansha.[VAR 0114(0014)]
Perfecting this recipe took the sweat and toil of\nthe entire Rust Syndicate. Please listen closely.[VAR 0114(0014)]
To craft the donut properly, its Flavor Scores must\nmeet or exceed the following values...[VAR 0114(0014)]
You’ll need at least 120 points in sweet, 40 points\nin spicy, and 340 points in sour.[VAR 0114(0014)]
Our recipe also calls for at least 40 points in bitter\nand 390 points in fresh.[VAR 0114(0014)]
We’ve got a secret ingredient for you, too.\c\nThe donut’s color has to match Rayquaza’s green,\nso I’ve procured the apex of culinary verdure...[VAR 0114(0013)]
Arboliva Oil![VAR 0114(0013)]
Wait. We’re using it just because it’s green?[VAR 0114(0006)]
Wait. We’re using it just because it’s green?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Sure. No sense making things complicated.\c\nThat Arboliva Oil will make your donut so tasty,\nthe experience will be, well, out of this world![VAR 0114(0013)]
So this is finally it, eh?[VAR 0114(0013)]
Ansha’s story is about to reach its grand finale.[VAR 0114(0013)]
We’ll be cheering you on from our headquarters.\nGo get ’em.[VAR 0114(0013)]
I’ll be up on the roof.[VAR 0114(0192)]
I can’t wait to see your masterpiece, Ansha![VAR 0114(0192)]
I’ll do my best![VAR 0114(01A5)]
First the Épice Noire, now Arboliva Oil... The Rust\nSyndicate loves their seasonings and condiments.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Ansha’s dream is within our grasp![VAR 0114(000B)]
Still waitin’ on that donut![VAR 0114(0192)]
Pii hya hya.
Kyururu.
We’re gonna do it. We’re gonna make Ansha’s\ndream finally come true![VAR 0114(0006)]
We’re gonna do it. We’re gonna make Ansha’s\ndream finally come true![VAR 0114(0005)]
[~ 430]
I’ve done it![VAR 0114(01A5)]
Here it is... The key to meeting Rayquaza—a [VAR FF00(0006)]Delta[VAR FF00(0000)]\n[VAR FF00(0006)]Old-Fashioned Donut[VAR FF00(0000)]![VAR 0114(01A5)]
Wow, Ansha. When we first met you, I never\nwould’ve guessed we’d end up all the way here.[VAR 0114(000C)]
And now Korrina’s waiting on the roof to go face\nyour final challenge.[VAR 0114(000B)]
You started us off on this legendary story, Ansha.\nTime for you to get your happy ending![VAR 0114(0006)]
You started us off on this legendary story, Ansha.\nTime for you to get your happy ending![VAR 0114(0005)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Thank you! And [VAR 0100(0000)] too.\nI\r\nknow\r\nyou\r\nthree\r\ncan\r\ndo it![VAR 0114(01A5)]
I’m not even going, and my heart’s still pounding.[VAR 0114(000C)]
What a big moment this is for Ansha.[VAR 0114(000B)]
[~ 440]
Ansha’s counting on us. Time to leap into\nHyperspace Lumiose and find Rayquaza![VAR 0114(0192)]
Let’s go!
I need to prepare
We need that special donut or we’re not getting\ninto Hyperspace Lumiose from here, right?[VAR 0114(0192)]
Huh? What did you come all the way up here for if\nyou weren’t ready?[VAR 0114(0192)]
We’re gonna battle Mega Rayquaza, catch it...and\nmake Ansha’s dream come true![VAR 0114(0192)]
Listen, you can’t go in there with your Boxes full.\nYou’re gonna have to catch Rayquaza for Ansha![VAR 0114(0192)]
It’s finally time![VAR 0114(0006)]

This is...the Sky Pillar, right?\c\nI guess this space is taking the shape of a place\nrelated to Ansha’s story.[VAR 0114(0005)]
I’m gonna get to meet—and battle—the very first\nPokémon that ever Mega Evolved...[VAR 0114(0192)]
It isn’t just Ansha’s dream that’s coming true...\nMine is too![VAR 0114(0192)]
I’m going to take on Mega Rayquaza with every\nounce of strength I’ve got![VAR 0114(0192)]
It’s somehow sorta...majestic? Or maybe “solemn”\nis more like it.[VAR 0114(0006)]

Look—up in the sky...[VAR 0114(0192)]
Something’s coming![VAR 0114(0192)]
[~ 461]
It’s time to catch Rayquaza.
[VAR BD06(0000)]You really did it, [VAR 0100(0000)]. You\ncaught\r\nRayquaza![VAR 0114(0192)]
I can already imagine Ansha’s smile when she\nhears the news![VAR 0114(0192)]
Same. ’Cause remember—we caught Rayquaza\nfor Ansha. You don’t get to keep it for yourself.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Same. ’Cause remember—we caught Rayquaza\nfor Ansha. You don’t get to keep it for yourself.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Yeah, I know...
Neither do you!
I know that! What’re you trying to say?[VAR 0114(0006)]
Well, yeah! What’re you implying here?[VAR 0114(0005)]
C’mon, let’s head back to Hotel Z. This is the\nmoment Ansha’s been waiting for![VAR 0114(0006)]
C’mon, let’s head back to Hotel Z. Ansha’s been\nwaiting for this moment![VAR 0114(0005)]
[~ 473]
[VAR 0100(0000)]! You’re back!\c\nHow...how did it go? With Rayquaza?[VAR 0114(01A5)]
Go on, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0192)]
Kiiirrryaaashiii!
Goodness...\c\nH-hello, Rayquaza![VAR 0114(01A5)]
What an honor it is to stand before such a fine\nPokémon![VAR 0114(01A5)]
And it never could have happened if I hadn’t met\nTeam MZ. I owe you all so very much![VAR 0114(01A5)]
No, no, not at all. YOU made this happen, Ansha![VAR 0114(000C)]
Lida’s right. Who else could have crafted such\nremarkable donuts?[VAR 0114(000B)]
If you say so...[VAR 0114(01A5)]
Pii...hya?
What’s the matter?[VAR 0114(0192)]
It’s nothing, really...\c\nI just felt a small pang when I realized that once I\ngive Rayquaza to my dear mama, it’ll be time to\r\nhang up my apron as your donut chef.[VAR 0114(01A5)]
Keep making donuts for us!
Why would you have to stop?
What? But...[VAR 0114(01A5)]
As long as Hyperspace Lumiose is still around,\nwe’ll want to keep exploring it![VAR 0114(0006)]
As long as Hyperspace Lumiose is still around,\nwe’ll want to keep exploring it![VAR 0114(0005)]
And we’d never keep you from seeing your mom,\nbut didn’t you say she’d be busy on a shoot for\r\na while longer?[VAR 0114(000C)]
In short, please keep Ansha’s Donuts open for us![VAR 0114(000B)]
I...don’t know what to say![VAR 0114(01A5)]
Y’know, Ansha—I’ve been thinking, and I’ve got a\nquestion for you.[VAR 0114(0192)]
Why’d you want to give Rayquaza to your mom,\nagain?[VAR 0114(0192)]
I thought that such a mighty Pokémon would be a\nfitting gift for my mighty mama.[VAR 0114(01A5)]
That’s a wonderful thought for a present. But\nwhat would happen after you gave it to her?[VAR 0114(0192)]
Well...I’d...[VAR 0114(01A5)]
I’d like to give her more mighty Pokémon, but I\nsuppose Rayquaza would be a hard act to follow...[VAR 0114(01A5)]
And I admit I’m not as excited to seek them out\nas I was to meet Rayquaza.[VAR 0114(01A5)]
I think you’ve already got plenty of wonderful\ngifts you could give to Diantha![VAR 0114(0192)]
I do? What kind of gifts?[VAR 0114(01A5)]
Pii hya!
Stories of what you’ve seen!
Stories of what you’ve done!
My...stories?[VAR 0114(01A5)]
That’s right!\c\nThink about it—there are people and Pokémon\nyou might never meet, even if you live in the same\r\ncity at the same time.[VAR 0114(0006)]
That’s right!\c\nThink about it—there are people and Pokémon\nyou might never meet, even if you live in the same\r\ncity at the same time.[VAR 0114(0005)]
But we managed to meet—and we did something\namazing together![VAR 0114(0006)]
But we managed to meet—and we did something\namazing together![VAR 0114(0005)]
That’s all quite true...but are you sure dear Mama\nwould be happy with my story as a gift?[VAR 0114(01A5)]
How could she not love that?\c\nIf I were in her shoes, I’d be straight up crying\ntears of joy![VAR 0114(000C)]
All I know is that I’m thrilled when my little sister\nshares her stories with me.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Well...I would very much like Mama to know\nabout everything I’ve done here in Lumiose.[VAR 0114(01A5)]
But I’d hate to worry her by letting her know I’ve\nbeen slipping out of Hotel Richissime.[VAR 0114(01A5)]
Oh, that? Don’t worry—Diantha knows![VAR 0114(0192)]
She WHAT?![VAR 0114(01A5)]
According to Jacinthe, yup.[VAR 0114(0192)]
Oh. Well, then! I suppose I can rest easy.[VAR 0114(01A5)]
Pardon me for leaving you out of the conversation,\nmy dear Rayquaza.[VAR 0114(01A5)]
On my journey to find you, I’ve met such lovely\npeople and done such exciting things.[VAR 0114(01A5)]
And I can’t wait to tell my dear mama all about it.[VAR 0114(01A5)]
It’s all thanks to you, really.[VAR 0114(01A5)]
Kiiirrryaaashiii!
One day, I will become a Pokémon Trainer...and I’ll\npresent you to Mama myself![VAR 0114(01A5)]
Until then...would you please look after dear\nRayquaza for me, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(01A5)]
I’d be happy to
Of course I will
Thank you ever so much![VAR 0114(01A5)]
I’ll be your coach, Ansha. I can train you up, and\nyou can pay me in donuts! Deal?[VAR 0114(0192)]
Deal![VAR 0114(01A5)]
In the end, I gave dear Mama two gifts.[VAR 0114(01A5)]
The first was an array of donuts made with all\nmy love.[VAR 0114(01A5)]
The second was a book telling the story of my\nadventures with Team MZ.[VAR 0114(01A5)]
Mama looked so very happy![VAR 0114(01A5)]
She even asked for more donuts by the dozen—\nalong with just as many new chapters of my story.[VAR 0114(01A5)]
What could I say but yes? My friends in Team MZ\nand I will have to continue our thrilling exploits![VAR 0114(01A5)]
But for now...thus concludes the story of how I,\nAnsha, came to meet the fine Rayquaza.[VAR 0114(01A5)]
I’m sure we’ll live happily ever after...with plenty\nmore stories to come![VAR 0114(01A5)]
[~ 540]
The next day...
Your alarm is going off...
Morning, sunshine.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Prepare to be astounded, kid. We’ve got a special\nnew system we want you to take for a spin![VAR 0114(0013)]
Come by my office and I’ll tell you all about it.[VAR 0114(0013)]
See you soon![VAR 0114(0013)]
[~ 547]
Now that this is all over with, I’m sure nothing\nTOO big or weird will happen for a while...right?[VAR 0114(000C)]
Perhaps the thrill of Lumiose is never knowing\nwhat strange thing lies just around the corner.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Lumiose is a lovely city. Our redevelopment plans\nwill allow all to experience its delights to the max.[VAR 0114(000E)]
I’m gonna keep on dancing!\c\nStarmie and I are gonna groove so hard, just the\nsight of us will get everyone dancing along![VAR 0114(000C)]
Ohhh, man. I can’t dance one more step right\nnow. I could use one of Ansha’s donuts...[VAR 0114(000C)]
I’m going to make pieces that bring my style to\nlife. How you dress is how you live, after all.[VAR 0114(000B)]
I’m glad to call Lumiose home. I can’t imagine\nNOT living in the city where all my friends are.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Zaff.
Y’know what makes me feel happy and at peace?\nSeeing the grin on Ansha’s face.[VAR 0114(0192)]
Team MZ’s the greatest. There’s no one out there\nquite like us![VAR 0114(0006)]
Team MZ’s the greatest. There’s no one out there\nquite like us![VAR 0114(0005)]

It’s a map of Lumiose City.\c\nIt looks like [VAR 018B(0001)] had been jotting down notes\non it about Rogue Mega Evolution incidents.
It’s a laptop all set up for video editing. Probably\nbest not to look through someone else’s files...
There are some corporate pamphlets about\nQuasartico Inc.
Is this [VAR 1100(00FF,0606)]TaunieUrbain’s bag?
It’s a stack of old newspapers about Lumiose,\ngathered as part of a search for someone.

Naveen’s clothing creations and fabrics are\nscattered all across the bed.
It’s Naveen’s beloved sewing machine.
Entire boxes are filled with vintage clothing\nNaveen has collected.
Various sketches and sewing tools are scattered\nall about.
It’s the signed Canari plush you gave Naveen!\c\nIt’s one of his prized possessions. Apparently, he\nlikes to recount his daily adventures to it.

This is a pretty big bag. It seems to be stuffed\nwith a large amount of clothing.
A bunch of sports drinks are on the table.
A bunch of sports drinks are lined up and waiting\nin front of the painting.
A full-length mirror like this is just what you’d\nneed to check your dance moves.
A workout mat has been rolled up and stood on\nits end to take up less space.
These postcards look like they were sent from the\nHoenn region.

I can make all manner of donuts,\nso long as you have the right Berries!
The secret to my donuts’ special flavor is getting\nthe perfect combination of Berries, you know!
Did you know that the hole in the middle\nof a donut helps it cook more evenly?
Do you think the world might look different\nwhen viewed through the hole of a donut?
I am particularly fond of kneading the dough\nfor my donuts. It’s so absorbing.
Adding yeast to your dough can make quite\nan impact on the texture of your donuts.
Welcome to Ansha’s Donuts, your own\nlittle neighborhood shop within Hotel Z!
Welcome to Ansha’s Donuts! There simply would\nbe no exploring Hyperspace Lumiose without us!
Welcome to Ansha’s Donuts—\npurveyor of Hoopa’s absolute favorites!
I’m feeling in particularly fine form today. Just\nwatch—I’ll make any donut you could ask for!
“Come on in! Grab a seat wherever you like!”\c\nOh, wouldn’t it be droll if I ran a real restaurant!
Did you know that the malasadas enjoyed\nin the Alola region are also a type of donut?
Let’s spread the love of donuts! It will be like\na great ring of joy encircling the entire world!
I’ve made so many donuts here with you...and I\nstill haven’t grown even a little tired of doing so!
I will try to make the greatest of donuts—a donut\neven capable of withstanding great Mega Power!
Now I can use up to four Berries\nwhen making a donut for you!
Now I can use up to five Berries\nwhen making a donut for you!
Now I can use up to six Berries\nwhen making a donut for you!
Now I can use up to seven Berries\nwhen making a donut for you!
Now I can use up to eight Berries\nwhen making a donut for you!
Would you like something spicy? Perhaps sweet\nor tart? Or maybe a fresh flavor—or a bitter one!
Keep ordering more donuts and carrying on\nwith your fine survey work, if you please!
I’ll start heating the butter at once—\nwe’ll have it melted and ready to go!
If you order lots of donuts now, you won’t\nneed to return as often to Hotel Z for more.
The secret to mashing Berries is doing it\nfinely enough to keep the paste smooth.
Donuts here in Lumiose\nare made plenty sweet!
We’re here to support your investigations\nwith my donuts and Hoopa’s powers!
Please try finding the perfect combination\nof Berries to get just the effects you wish.
A donut’s hole is a curious\nthing—a thing of nothing.
Truly, Hyperspace Berries are the most\nmysterious and wondrous of Berries.
Do not forget the value of a good Level\nBoost when placing your donut order!
If you don’t provide Hoopa with enough Donut\nEnergy, your survey work may get cut short.
Oh—I would like to try my hand at making a donut\nthat could lead you to meet more alpha Pokémon!
Perhaps a donut could help you meet more\nShiny Pokémon... That would be delightful!
The higher the Flavor Score a donut\nhas, the stronger its effects will be!
Hoopa does adore sweet donuts!
I think Shiny Pokémon would like something nice\nand tempting—perhaps a sweet-flavored donut?
Very sweet donuts should bring you\ngood luck in various forms, I believe.
A spicy donut with curry would be a very\nHotel Z kind of donut, don’t you agree?
Perhaps the spices in a curry donut could\nstimulate your Pokémon’s offensive abilities.
I do feel that a spicy donut would offer some\nadvantages for going on the offense in battle.
Hoopa does enjoy a nice tart flavor,\nif you make a donut that’s a bit sour.
A donut that makes it easier to obtain Berries\nmeans you can bring me even more ingredients!
It seems sour donuts can grant all sorts\nof effects for the items you might find.
You might not expect it, but Hoopa does\nenjoy a mature, bitter flavor profile as well.
I hope this donut can help keep you safe\nfrom incoming attacks of a particular type.
I believe bitter donuts will be effective\nat boosting your team’s defenses.
A lovely fresh flavor can be just the thing to\ndeliver a little shock to Hoopa’s taste buds!
I recommend a fresh flavor if you’re making a\ndonut with the aim of catching more Pokémon.
I believe fresh flavors ought to produce donuts\nthat help you successfully catch wild Pokémon.
I do wonder what effects this combination could\nproduce. We’ll find out once it’s done, won’t we!
This will be an astoundingly special donut\nthat’s worthy of Operation Mega Donut!
Oh, I hope you’ll get to meet a fine Groudon!\nLet’s put in plenty of Berries to be sure!
Oh, I hope you’ll get to meet a fine Kyogre!\nLet’s put in plenty of Berries to be sure!
Oh, I hope you’ll get to meet that fine Rayquaza!\nThis donut should be bursting with Berries!
I feel very good about this—together we’ll\ncreate the ultimate Plasma-Glazed Donut!
What has you so deep in thought? Are you\ndreaming up a particularly strange donut?
I can make a donut from any combination\nof Berries at all—just you wait and see!
Oh dear. Are you feeling overwhelmed\nby all of your available donut options?
If you find yourself troubled over what to choose,\njust toss in anything! We can always make more!
You seem to have ground to a halt!\nToo many options to choose from?
It’s amusing to see that even you sometimes find\nyourself in a daze, [VAR 0100(0000)].
Making donuts is, in effect, making\nhappiness. Wouldn’t you agree?
Observing the fundamentals and pouring your\nheart into your work makes for a fine donut.
I’ll do all I can to make donuts\nthat Pokémon find delicious!
It is said that a person’s tastes\ncan tell you quite a lot about them.
Eating truly is one of the fundamental\nexperiences of being alive, isn’t it?
Good cooking comes from a solid foundation.\nRushing it won’t do any good for anyone.
Do take your time deciding.
Din, din, don...\nDin, din, don... ♪
I suppose the chef I most admire would\nhave to be...Mr. Siebold. He is wonderful.

What was that weird place you ended up in\nwhile you were chasing after Ansha? You’re\nstill processing what happened when a call\ncomes from Corbeau, asking you to stop by...
It’s decided! You are to survey Hyperspace\nLumiose for the Rust Syndicate. It seems\nHoopa—the Pokémon that travels with\nAnsha—holds the key to your success.
Your quiet morning was interrupted by the\nfront door opening with a furious bang—\nfollowed by an equally furious Lebanne!\nLooks like you’ll need to talk her down.
Hotel Z is feeling quite lively with the recent\naddition of Ansha and Korrina. And it looks\nlike your survey work in Hyperspace Lumiose\nhas a long way to go before it’s wrapped up.
Finally—a break from surveying Hyperspace\nLumiose! Take this chance to join Ansha and\nKorrina for some sightseeing around the city\nbefore Corbeau inevitably calls you up again.
What was that loud sound you heard in Team\nMZ’s strategy meeting room? Could it be an\nintruder? Go search the room and see if you\ncan find the source of the noise!
Your investigation of Hyperspace Lumiose\nis slowly making progress, which has helped\nto calibrate the tools that detect distortions\nand unlock even more dangerous areas.
Breakfast time has come and gone, yet there\nis still no sign of Naveen—only his Scrafty,\nwho seems to want your attention. Time to\ngo check on Naveen in his room!
The large distortion over the tower seems\nto be causing more and more trouble for\nLumiose. This mystery must be solved\nbefore something terrible befalls the city!
There seems to be a troubling possibility that\nHyperspace Lumiose could simply swallow\nup the real Lumiose. Is there any way to stop\nit from expanding before it’s too late?
Just when you thought you could finally get\nsome rest, Lida’s shouting roused the whole\nhotel! What is going on? Better check it out!
It sounds like the data you’ve been gathering\nfinally led to a breakthrough. At last you can\nsolve the mystery and stop Hyperspace\nLumiose from fusing with the city!
The mysteries of hyperspace have been\nunraveled, but Ansha’s original goal still\nremains unfulfilled. More survey work may\nbe needed to find that Legendary Pokémon!
Rayquaza, the Legendary Pokémon Ansha\nseeks, should be waiting on the other side\nof the emerald distortion that has appeared.\nMake a special donut and prepare to catch it!
You’ve learned that Groudon dwells on the\nother side of the ruby distortion. Make the\nspecial donut needed to enter Groudon’s\npocket of hyperspace, then go and catch it!
You’ve learned that Kyogre dwells on the\nother side of the sapphire distortion. Make\nthe special donut needed to enter Kyogre’s\npocket of hyperspace, then go and catch it!

Hey! Wanna trade stuff? Gimme any item, and I’ll\ngive you something back!
Yeah, sounds fun!
Sorry, not now

Anytime you’ve got items you don’t need, bring\n’em here and I’ll trade you!
Whoa! Canari Bread?!
Are you for real? I can have this Canari Bread...?\nI mean, no backsies! It’s mine now!\c\nI’m a total Canatic! I’ve been dying to get my\nhands on one of these!
The fact that you had it in the first place means\nyou’re a Canatic too, huh? Thanks so much!\c\nI gotta give you something zaptastic in return.
That’s right—Popping Candy!\c\nIt’s great. It gives your mouth a nice zap—like an\nElectric-type move in candy form!
I don’t think I can take that. Trade me somethin’\nelse!
MORE Canari Bread? YES!!!\c\nI don’t have anything as awesome as before, but\nyou can have [VAR 1302(0003,0000)][VAR 010A(0003)]!

Seems like you’ve made it into a strange slice of\nHyperspace Lumiose, huh, kid?[VAR 0114(0013)]
Kinda resembles one of our battle zones... Guess\nwe should call it a [VAR FF00(0006)]hyperspace battle zone[VAR FF00(0000)]![VAR 0114(0013)]
Might be that the Trainers you see there are\nreflections of the bitter resentment felt by\r\nTrainers defeated on our side, eh?[VAR 0114(0013)]
Whatever they are, I bet I can come up with some\nsurvey tasks suited to a hyperspace battle zone.\r\nI’ll keep you plenty busy, so no slouching, kid![VAR 0114(0013)]

If polygonal modeling keeps evolving, game\nworlds will become indistinguishable from the\r\nreal world around us.[VAR 0114(01AF)]
Maybe if Porygon keeps on evolving, it could also\nbreak down the walls between the real world and\r\nthe world of video games. Don’t you think?[VAR 0114(01AF)]
Here. I’ll let you have this rather dubious device.[VAR 0114(01AF)]
You should try a Link Trade with a Porygon2\nthat’s holding that disc.[VAR 0114(01AF)]
It’s getting harder and harder to tell what’s real\nanymore. Maybe I’M not even real...[VAR 0114(01AF)]
