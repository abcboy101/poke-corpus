You thrashed my whole team—even Eelektross?!
So in a contest of strength, I lose...
No wonder everyone’s talkin’ about you...
How formidable! Perhaps I put too great a burden\non Buneary—it only just joined my team!
Inconceivable!
Even Excadrill couldn’t get past yer defenses, eh?
Your Pokémon shine with justice...
I see! Your Pokémon are a little stronger than I\nexpected.
Well, that’s disappointing. I wasn’t able to let\nScolipede fully shine.
Talk about losin’ face...
I must remain classy, even when conquered...
I must appear luminous, even in loss...

Maybe my li’l Staryu does want to Mega Evolve\nafter all...
We may have lost, but Mega Scrafty is peerless in\nmy books.

Your true strength lies in drawing out the full\nstrength of your Pokémon, huh?
What unique style you have!
It’s not that I underestimated you... It’s just that\nyou’re even stronger than I imagined.
Good thing those old guys aren’t here to see this!

Paralysis didn’t stop you in your tracks?!
At least I’ve got no doubts at all about how\ncapable you are in battle!
Nooo! But our winning streak—!
Nooo! Even my status moves couldn’t change this\noutcome?!
Clearly you are very good friends with your own\nPokémon as well...
B-but I reduced the damage my team would take\nfrom attacks!
What firepower! It’s too hot to handle!
Bo-AHHH!
No WAY!
Well, this will certainly be a blow to my reputation\nas a trap-move specialist.
What a rude way to be brought back to earth!
Your strength as the Canari Quiz Whiz is the most\nelectrifying of all!
Guess relying on my SUPER ENERGY to win the\nday was a HUGE mistake...
Were they not able to absorb HP quickly enough\nto hold out?
How did we not detect this outcome?!
Ahhh, the sky’s the limit for your strength...
B-but the rain was on my side! At least now it\nmight hide my tears...
Ka-boooooom!
We’ve got nothing left! It’s over!
Great... How am I supposed to show you that I’ve\ngot any skills if I lose?
Looks like I was the one to flinch in the face of\nyour Pokémon’s strength and vigor.
Did you see how many different moves we could\npull out, just by waving a finger?
Nooo, you’ve poisoned my precious memories of\nmy trip to Galar!
Dragon types are so strong, but my weakness as a\nTrainer lost us this battle...
“How dare you!”
I lost even after I sent out my Mega Pinsir... Why\nwasn’t my love for Bug types enough?!
Right... Normal types aren’t normally known for\nclinching a victory, are they?
Was I maybe cursed or something?!
Some things can only be learned through battle.\nNow I know what a real steely Trainer looks like...
If you unleash attacks that fast, of course my\nteam can’t recover HP in time!
La-di-da-di-da... ♪
Even if we lost, I know you’re still the greatest\never, Pikachu!
I think maybe the Alolan form can’t use its true\npower without Alolan pancakes to fuel it...
It’s not appearances that matter most in battle...\nIt’s the strength within that matters most!
I sure lost in no time!
That battle—now that was upliftin’!
I am the greatest of all the Furfrou Elite Four—but\nyou have cut me down to size!
To defeat the top Trainer in the Furfrou Elite Four...\nYou shine brilliantly indeed!
You have brought me low—Diamant, chief among\nthe Furfrou Elite Four... What a show of strength.
As the face of the Furfrou Elite Four, I have little\nchoice but to graciously acknowledge your win!
Perfection.
Who cares if we lost! As long as we got fired up,\nthen that’s all I really need!
I hope Honedge is feeling better after that!
What a mega defeat! I’ve got to admit that getting\nbeat so bad isn’t very inspiring...
Another mega defeat! That really isn’t very\ninspiring for me as a Trainer...
Three mega defeats! Thank goodness I’ve got my\nart, because I sure don’t feel good about battling!
Man, the Trainers here in Lumiose are just way\ntoo strong!
Whoa. Your Aurorus is...really strong for an\nAurorus, you know that?
Another defeat... It feels like the more we battle,\nthe greater the gap between us grows.

It can sure shock your Pokémon\nwhen someone sneaks up on you!
In the Z-A Royale, evading your\nopponents’ notice is key!
Man, I’m not racking\nup any Ticket Points!
Wait, you beat ME?\nAre you really Rank Z?
I just wanted to raise\nsome bug Pokémon...
Aw, I wanted to show off my\nadorable team even more!
Fly high...and eventually\nyou must come down...
I think you deserve a little\nreward for that fine victory.
Well, that strategy didn’t work...\nBut trying’s all part of the fun!
Oh, Espurr, you really do like\nto follow your own tempo...
I’m not leaving Lumiose\ntill I make it to Rank A!
Oops, I stayed up all night again.\nTomorrow morning’s gonna suck.
Even my soothing Grass types\ncan’t take away this sting...
I see! So this is the kind of silly\nentertainment in vogue lately?
Guess trying to intimidate you\ninto losing won’t work, huh?
I may have lost the battle, but my\nteam still wins for being cuter!
Even my Electrike’s Speed couldn’t\nget us all the way to victory, huh?
My dream of holding a race every\nday grows still more distant...
I just wanted to reach Rank A\nso I could live the easy life!
But higher Speed is supposed to\nmean we use our moves first!
I wouldn’t lose in a game of tag!\nIf only this had been tag...
Considering I haven’t evolved my\nteam, we’re doing pretty good!
B-but I’d saved up\nso many medals...
I was gonna ask for the tower to\nbe mine if I won the whole Royale!
Now I want to evolve my Pokémon\nand demand a rematch from you!
My trusty partner’s been with me\nall over—and through everything!
I only joined this thing because\nI was a bit curious, sheesh...
Aw geez, I’ll have to write an\nincident report for this loss...
I wanted to win with the Pokémon\nwho keep me company at work!
I just wanted to\nmake a splash!
Give me just a moment. I need to\nrun some numbers on my loss...
I wore myself out surveying the\nzone before the battle even started.
Losing makes me want to run\nfrom the scene at full speed!
There you go! One victory,\ndelivered from me to you.
Taking part in Lumiose’s Z-A\nRoyale will get me some likes!
How have I come to this...\nScrabbling over paltry medals...
I could travel the whole world,\nbut I can only raise my rank here!
I was just out for a\nnice midnight jog!
I’m going to go run off\nthe stress of this defeat!
I think I could really get hooked\non this Z-A Royale competition...
Yeah, I think maybe I’d better\nstick to construction work...
Aww, I was hoping my knowledge\nof the streets would help more!
Please come by Café Introversion!\nI only came here to advertise it...
B-but I brought three whole\nPokémon with me! Three!
Binacle, I think I could\nuse a nice glass of water...
All this is so new to me!\nI really flubbed it, didn’t I!
But...my dream of collecting\nevery last bonus card...
I’d better run for it!\nOn one, two, and—!
I’m not the kind of Trainer\nwho’ll get stuck at Rank W!
Once you hit Rank G, you won’t\nfind any pushovers. No easy wins!
I’m not finished! I’ve gotta reach\nRank A to take over my company!
I can’t hit the road with this\nkind of loss hanging over me...
Guess I better just hit the\nroad, after a loss like that...
It’s really hard to sneak up\nwithout getting spotted...
I just like Machoke, all right!\nIt’s better than anything else!
I’m so hooked on the Royale that\nI keep snoozing through work!
I’ll keep running till I cross that\nfinish line labeled “Rank A”!
Proper breathing is important\nfor both jogging and battling.
Someday even the taxi cabs will\nprobably disappear from Lumiose...
Even if I know all the streets,\nI can’t find my way to victory.
I wish everyone would use\nAriados in their teams.
D’aw, I didn’t manage to get\nany really good bonus cards.
I pride myself on spotting\nsneak attackers, and yet...
T-terrifying!
I managed to reach Rank G,\nbut this might be it for me.
So good breeding alone can’t\ncinch a win in Pokémon battles...
Rank G is when you can start\nenjoying some real tough battles!
I may have lost, but I’m not\nfinished. I’ll still move up!
So, even my Ivysaur wasn’t\nenough to help me win!
I suppose Absol came to me\nto warn me of this defeat...
To be an ace means to remain\ncool in any situation—even defeat.
I should hurry and treat my team.\nThey all fought so hard for me.
Even if I lose, I learn something!\nI’m going to keep growing strong!
Hm, can I take my own team\nto the Pokémon Center?
You might not dress like one of us,\nbut you’re surely an Ace Trainer!
You deserve my respect for\nthat victory, and you have it.
Reaching the higher ranks means\neverybody I fight is real strong!
I may have lost, but I picked up\na few ideas to use next time!
I’ll take this hefty delivery of\ndefeat and head on home...
Might as well enjoy a postprandial\ncoffee, if you’re staying up anyway!
Enjoy that after-dinner coffee!\nIt’s quite good hot or cold.
I lost to you, but I bet I’m strong\nenough to beat my business rival!
I’ll change Lumiose City from the\nCity of Light to a City of Shadows!
I’m still ready for battle anytime!\nI keep my body and mind focused!
Putting up scaffolding all day,\nbattling all night—I’m beat!
But those two were\nmy pride and joy!
What a cold world this is...\nwhen you can’t seem to win...
I’ve got to move up the ranks\nor I’ll never get a Mega Ring!
How many different bonus cards\ndo you think there are to collect?
Being rich certainly affords me\nsome advantages—but not a win.
Whoa. Lumiose’s Trainers\nare, like, unbelievably strong!
When I become Rank A, I’m\ngoing to make myself CEO!
These dark streets...hehehe...\nthey delight me...even in defeat...
Well, I guess that’s that.\nMaybe I’ll go for a run.
I thought I saw the route that\nwould lead me to victory...
But I’d collected so many medals!\nI don’t want to start over again...
Maybe I’d be better off pulling\nsome night shifts instead...
I just want to serve coffee!\nIt’s really good—please drink it!
Having Pokémon battles at night...\nIt’s all a bit thrilling, isn’t it?
The Z-A Royale is another facet\nof Lumiose’s identity, you know.
My deliveries keep piling up, and\nnow you pile this defeat on me?
I’m collecting every\nrank I can reach!
The Z-A Royale is a whole new\nreason to come visit Lumiose!
Grass...and Ghost...\nall gone, gone, gone...
If I don’t raise my rank, my Klefki\nwill never share its keys with me!
It felt like you were totally one\nwith your Pokémon—y’know?!
But I’m the best in my class!
Tonight we may be enemies, yet\nby day I might serve you coffee.
Whether I win or lose, this makes\nfor great memories of my trip!
The nights are surprisingly\nbright here in Lumiose, huh?
Phew. The strength I’ve built up\nmaking deliveries wasn’t enough.
Seems like this battle zone was\nsuper effective against me.
Garbodor or Garbodor?\nO Garbodor do I adore!
Seriously? Here I thought Noibat\nwas perfectly suited to the night!
Being tough is supposed to be\nmy thing! But you beat me good!
I’m here to investigate whether the\nZ-A Royale is truly aboveboard.
No longer shall Lampent\nlight the dark night for me...
Up here in Rank D, it’s a real\nchallenge to accumulate points.
This is fine. I really only wanted\nan excuse to show off my Florges.
I had all the best tutors to teach\nme how to win, and yet here I am...
You’re quite the Trainer, to have\nfound your way to that victory.
I want to go up the ranks and\nbe known as a child prodigy!
Working my way up the ranks here\nis more fun than it is in the office!
Did you see how different male\nand female Meowstic appear?
I was THIS close to winning. No\none’s more aware of it than me.
You may have got the better of me\nthis time, Lumiose, but I’ll be back!
That was only two strikes!\nI didn’t strike out yet!
Victory would’ve been mine, if only\nwe’d been competing as couriers!
I’ll reach Rank A, then I’ll set up\naerial delivery services for the city!
At least the coffee drinks that\nI make are definitely Rank A!
I wanted to reach Rank A...then I\ncould make everything here free!
I’m here to investigate undercover,\nbut so far everything looks good.
I lost using the Machamp I’d got\nin a link trade with my teacher...
Our battle here\nwas true art!
I want to open up every corner\nof Lumiose for the Pokémon.
Typical Team MZ!
I will reach Rank A, then I will\ntake over the family business.
I’ll become number one, then\nI’ll get all the Mega Stones!
I work in scaffolding because\nI like reaching great heights!
I WILL pull off my big plan to make\nfurisode mandatory in Lumiose.
I will make sure the whole world\nknows the wonder of Ghost types!
My dream is to stand at the\npinnacle of all Trainers!
I want everyone to know beyond\na doubt that I’m the strongest!
Boy, I thought I’d be invincible as\nlong as I kept healing my team!
I was defeated, even after using\nMega Evolution... A mega defeat!
But it was Mega Pidgeot!\nME-GA PI-DGE-OT!
I figured I’d better at least try this\nRoyale thing to see if I’d like it.
I just figured I’d have a battle\nwhile out for my evening run.
Bug-type Pokémon are\nquick to evolve, y’know!
If you’re after Slowpoke tail,\nI’m afraid we don’t serve it.
I should take my team home and\ntreat them to something nice...
I’m a tourist! Shouldn’t you\nmake me feel welcome?!
Between the redevelopment and\nthe Royale, Lumiose is changing!
I’m completely bushed after trying\nso hard to look out for danger!
Hmm. Using the backstreets might\nbe better, even in a battle zone...
I train all my Pokémon.\nThey’re very strong.
Was it kinda obvious that I’m\na big fan of the Dragon type?
Is it already over? I wanted\nto have some more fun!
Tsk! I’ll fill you up to bursting with\ndelicious coffee for beating me!
At this point, I seem to\nbe collecting losses...
Do you think I should worry\nmore about getting spotted?
I’m really good at my job!\nBut battling...not so much.
Think I could avoid battles if\nI just kept running around?
At least I used all the experience\nI gained traveling to reach Rank U!
I wish my friends back home\ncould join the Z-A Royale too!
You all seem to be having so much\nfun chasing your little medals.
We are the colors to be spread\non the canvas of the Z-A Royale.
If you lose, you simply try again.\nNo one can leave the Z-A Royale.
I thought so hard before I evolved\none of my Scyther, and I still lost...
If I reach Rank A, I’m gonna\ntotally remake my school!
All this battling makes me want\nto get the ol’ gang back together.
Looks like all the training I did\nat Gyms can only get me so far.
I’ll be the strongest courier ever!\nThat’s my one and only dream!
I’ve battled powerhouses in every\nregion but still can’t reach the top!
I’ve gotta win to find out what that\n“No, you’re not the one” meant!
I really wanted to beat you so\nI could help out Ivor-sensei!
Oops, gotta act weak or folks could\nrealize I’m International Police...
You’ve gotta be strong to make\nfolks drink your coffee, see!
Mercy, please! Mr. Philippe’ll\nhave my head for losin’!
I guess the strongest office worker\nexcels in business, not battle...
I’m going to win this thing and\nask to double my vacation time!
Oh, how I wish I could take\npart in a Jacinthe Royale!
I’ll abolish wild zones so I can go\nzooming down the street again!
I’ll achieve Rank A in the Lumiose\nCafé Grand Prix, once and for all!
We’ve beaten so many fierce rivals\naround the world, all to lose here?
Hey, I still reached Rank B with\njust two Delibird! Wild, right?
I’ll have you drink a cup\nof victory coffee on me!
Could I get as strong as you\nare if I joined Team MZ too?
I don’t have any particular wish.\nI just want my strength recognized.
Order born out of chaos!\nVictory born out of defeat!
I’ve been battling here to become\nstrong enough to protect people...
What strength you possess—\nto shrug off Mega Medicham!
This loss won’t be the end for us!\nWe’ll keep walking this long path!
Aw, c’mon! Weren’t you shocked?\nStunfisk should’ve shocked you.
LET’S GO, DYN4MO!!!
My precious partners! They’re\nsuch great helpers to me at work!
Where can I even find a\nMega Stone for Ampharos...?
I can’t give up if we’re ever to\nsucceed in abolishing wild zones!
Ivor-sensei isn’t my sensei.\nI only study under Gwynn!
Dedenne will always be it for me!\nI proclaim it with pride, even now!
I tried to encapsulate both brains\nand brawn, but I guess I failed...
Would you say my Pumpkaboo\nis a Small Variety Pumpkaboo?
So this is the strength that took\neven Mr. Philippe by surprise...
Poison types are real toxic...\nSeriously toxic. Watch yourself.
If only I could’ve stopped you here,\nmaybe Canari could’ve won this!
Listen, because it’s simple. Power\ncomes down to being powerful.
Using Steel types is proof of how\nhard and unyielding yer spirit is.
Hmph. I get what the\nboss would see in you.
Oh no. I’ve lost... Now I’ll be locked\nin a Jacinthe zone as punishment.
But I made it this far with my\nexclusive team of Pokémon!
I can’t let down my DYN4MO crew!\nOr the construction crew either!
As I’d expect of Team MZ... You’re\na worthy rival to Ivor-sensei!
Dragon types are hard to raise,\nbut their powers are superior!
[~ 343]
Losing makes me want to run\nfrom the scene at full speed!
Looks like all the training I did\nat Gyms can only get me so far.
When you hit this level,\nwins don’t come easy.
This time I’m definitely getting my\nwish to double my vacation time!
We’ve beaten so many fierce rivals\naround the world, all to lose here?
At least I used all the experience\nI gained traveling to get this far!
Maybe I’d be better off pulling\nsome night shifts instead...
Between the redevelopment and\nthe Royale, Lumiose is changing!
Oops, I stayed up all night again.\nTomorrow morning’s gonna suck.
I’m really good at my job!\nBut battling...not so much.

Someday even the taxi cabs will\nprobably disappear from Lumiose...
I thought I saw the route that\nwould lead me to victory...
I really tried to raise\nmy bug Pokémon well...
I may have lost again to you, but\nmy team still wins for being cuter!
Even now, I still get surprised\nwhen someone sneaks up on me!
But those two were\nmy pride and joy!
The Z-A Royale is another facet\nof Lumiose’s identity, you know.
D’aw, I thought Noivern would be\neven better suited to the night!
I’ve got to rack up more wins\nor I’ll never get a Mega Ring!
In the Z-A Royale, evading your\nopponents’ notice is key!
This is fine. I really only wanted\nan excuse to show off my Florges.
I was defeated, even after using\nMega Evolution... A mega defeat!
I wanted the tower as my prize\nfor the Royale, but look at it now!
Garbodor or Garbodor?\nO Garbodor do I adore!
This loss won’t be the end for us!\nWe’ll keep walking this long path!
Hey, I still hold my own with\njust two Delibird! Wild, right?
Hmm. Using the backstreets might\nbe better, even in a battle zone...
Even if I know all the streets,\nI can’t find my way to victory.
Hm, can I take my own team\nto the Pokémon Center?
I won’t have any points to show\nfor it if I keep losing like this...
Will I need to compete directly to\nwin the Lumiose Café Grand Prix?
I suppose Absol came to me\nto warn me of this defeat...
I had all the best tutors reteach\nme how to win, and yet here I am...
I want to open up every corner\nof Lumiose for the Pokémon.
If you lose, you simply try again.\nNo one can leave the Z-A Royale.
I should hurry and treat my team.\nThey all fought so hard for me.
I’m investigating the ties between\nthe Z-A Royale and Quasartico.
Would you say my Gourgeist\nis a humble Medium Variety?
Order born out of chaos!\nVictory born out of defeat!
So this is the strength that took\neven Mr. Philippe by surprise...
Hmph. I sure get what the\nboss sees in you, kiddo.
Listen, because it’s simple. Power\ncomes down to being powerful.
Awww man. I finally decide to\nevolve it into Scizor, and for what?
I can’t let down my DYN4MO crew!\nOr the construction crew either!
I’ll abolish wild zones so I can go\nzooming down the street again!
No wonder everyone’s talkin’\nabout you, even in the Royale...
I took Haunter out of my team,\nbut don’t you mind that!
It felt like you were totally one\nwith your Pokémon—y’know?!
Whoa. Lumiose’s Trainers\nare, like, unbelievably strong!
Oops, gotta act weak or folks could\nrealize I’m International Police...
I don’t know if there’s a rank that\ntruly reflects your strength.
I don’t have any particular wish.\nI just want my strength recognized.
I’ll change Lumiose City from the\nCity of Light to a City of Shadows!
I may have lost, but I picked up\na few ideas to use next time!
I want everyone to know I’m the\nstrongest! I want to prove I lived!
Using Steel types is proof of how\nhard and unyielding yer spirit is.
Poison types are real toxic...\nSeriously toxic. Watch yourself.
Seriously! You should’ve\nbeen shocked by my Stunfisk!
I can’t give up if we’re ever to\nsucceed in abolishing wild zones!
As I’d expect of Team MZ... You’re\na worthy rival to Ivor-sensei!
But it was Mega Pidgeot!\nME-GA PI-DGE-OT!

I know well the taste of defeat...\nThat is why I long for victory.
The light of Mega Evolution\nbrought us new hope.
I must appear luminous,\neven in loss...
If only we’d been in a Jacinthe\nzone, I could have cut loose!
I much prefer Jacinthe zones\nto these gaudy battle zones!
Losing makes me want to run\nfrom the scene at full speed!
Looks like all the training I did\nat Gyms can only get me so far.

Oh no... Looks like I lost...
Since you won, I’ll admit it... I’m really happy that\nwe’re both on Team MZ.
I know I lost...but I gave you a good fight, huh,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]? Guess I’m pretty great!
Ah, but if I go home having lost, my daughter will\nbe unhappy with me...
I lost?! Dang...
All right, ya got me, I lost! Tell ya what—I’ll fix up\nyer hotel free of charge.
Defeat... How incredibly unjust!
...Seriously?
Even when you beat me, I still end up having fun.\nGuess it’s ’cause I can be myself around you.
Your talents are on par with Mr. Corbeau’s... It’s\nalmost enough to sway my loyalty.
The agony of defeat is nothing compared to the\njoy of witnessing such magnificent might!
Battling you makes me remember how sharp my\nskills used to be, back before I met Jacinthe.
It is entirely thanks to you that I’ve discovered\nhow enjoyable Pokémon battles can be.
This is ridiculous! Me, losing? Repeatedly?! This\njust doesn’t happen...
At least Pokémon battles lend some appeal to\ntrying over and over, knowing you’ll fail.
I think I’ll go take a lap around Lumiose to blow\noff some stress from this loss!
Even when I tried to get good in the Z-A Royale, I\nstill never stood out in class. Can’t catch a break...
The harmonious flavors of my Pokémon were so\nperfect, and yet...
Maybe I can’t defeat you, but I know I’m still\ngetting stronger!
Will I ever be able to defeat your Pokémon? The\nvery notion seems...inconceivable!
My Mega Evolution is simply the most marvelous\nof all, wouldn’t you agree?
The Pokémon that fought for me are so very chic.\nSo very stylish. Even in defeat!
Say, as the first person you ever battled here, isn’t\nit fair to say I set you on the path to greatness?
I’m so glad I’ve got you as a rival...especially\n’cause I know I can go all out against you!
I’m so glad I’ve got you as a rival...especially\n’cause I know I can go all out against you!
I’m so glad I’ve got you as a rival...especially\n’cause I know I can go all out against you!
I love having battles like this, thanks to\nPokémon...and to you!

All right, ya got me, I lost! Tell ya what—I’ll fix up\nyer hotel free of charge.
Defeat... How incredibly unjust!
I’ll go someplace else...and heal from this sorrow.

Maybe I can’t defeat you, but I know I’m still\ngetting stronger!
Perhaps I ought to start a fan club for your team...
Seriously? Again?!
[~ 561]
You’re a g[VAR 1100(00FF,0302)]uyirl who knows how to enjoy h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]iser salad!
You should hone your palate enough to\nappreciate truly fine dishes!
I was defeated by my insatiable hunger for a battle\nI could savor!
What an amazing technique you have!
What a brilliant victory... Congratulations...
Amazing! Absolutely amazing! You’ve shown me a\nnew world of Pokémon battling!
It’s decided! You are quite simply the best! To put\nit any other way would not do you justice...
To have polished off a full course of two-star\nbattles, you must be the true gourmet here!
Now that is how you do a restaurant battle...
Perhaps I shouldn’t say it, but I can’t hold back—\ndon’t get cocky! It’ll only get harder from here!
A perfect Pokémon battle! Much like a perfect\nblend of magnificent spices!
So this is the purpose of a restaurant battle...\nTo work up an appetite by losing spectacularly.
My well-marinated battling technique did not\nstand up to your refined palate!
I’m s-so nervous being here with everyone\nwatching that I can’t even taste a thing...
Once you’ve experienced the best of battles, you\ncome to see how little others have to offer.
I can’t believe I messed up like this! I feel as if I’ve\nbeen gutted like a fish!
Just one more win, and you’ll complete your full\ncourse—but can you stand the hunger pangs?
Wow! Le wow, indeed! What a three-star Trainer!\nYou’re a genius of battle—a true bon[VAR 1100(00FF,0A07)] vivantne vivante!

Trainer Tips
Pokémon raised by people seem to grow\nstronger than those that live in the wild.
Even Pokémon of the same species\nwill demonstrate some differences in\nstrength from one individual to another.
Taking another Trainer’s Pokémon makes\nyou a thief. Only throw Poké Balls at wild\nPokémon that you want to catch!
When you want to be sure a move will\nland or a Poké Ball will hit your target,\nremember to use [VAR BD0A(0002)]ZL to focus on it!
Wild Pokémon wander our city, even\noutside of wild zones. If one comes at\nyou with an attack, use [VAR BD0A(0004)]Sp_2 to dodge!
If you want to change your outfit, use\n[VAR BD0A(0004)]Sp_1 to open the main menu, then press\n[VAR BD0A(0005)]Minus to give yourself a fresh look.
Don’t throw away your future—throw\nPoké Balls instead! To throw a Poké Ball\nat a target, use [VAR BD0A(0002)]ZR!
If you hit a wild Pokémon with a move\nand it becomes dazed, that’s your catch\nwindow! Throw a Poké Ball!
Press [VAR BD0A(0004)]Plus to open your map. From there,\nyou’ll be able to select a spot to travel\nto and zip right over in an instant!
If you want to dash, press [VAR BD0A(0006)]Cancel!\nYou’ll keep up a brisk pace as\nlong as you don’t stop moving.
Not all Pokémon evolve by leveling\nup—some need to have specific items\nused on them in order to evolve.
Pokémon with a high Speed stat\nwon’t have to wait as long between\nusing their moves in battle.
Pokémon can learn moves by\nleveling up or by using TMs—\nshort for Technical Machines!
When a Pokémon uses one of its\nmoves as a Plus Move, it won’t need\nto wait as long as usual to use it!
While focused on a target, you can\nmove [VAR BD0A(0007)]Stick_R up, down, left, or right to\nswitch focus to another nearby target.
Pokémon Centers, cafés, and the like\nwill be registered as travel spots after\nyou visit them for the first time.
Some moves can be affected by weather.\nFor example, rain weakens Fire-type moves\nbut gives Water-type moves a small boost.
Lumiose is simply bursting with cafés!\nAnd word has it that Pokémon enjoy\nrelaxing in cafés as much as people do.
When you feel there’s no hope of winning\nin a Z-A Royale battle, choose to forfeit.\nYou can always earn more medals later.
Any Pokémon you obtain by trading with\nanother Trainer will get a small boost to\nthe Exp. Points it receives as it grows.
If you’re in the market for Mega Stones,\nconsider a visit to the Stone Emporium\nor Quasartico Inc. for all your needs!
If you use [VAR BD0A(000C)]Stick_L_Push to crouch, you can hide in\npatches of tall grass or behind objects.\nPokémon will be less likely to spot you!
Your Pokémon will grow more friendly\ntoward you if you spend time relaxing\nat cafés together.
Have your Pokémon unleash as many\nmoves as possible—it will cause that\nPokémon to build up Mega Power!
Some Pokémon only evolve during\ncertain times of the day.
A Pokémon whose Trainer is nearby will\ngain more Mega Power using moves than\na Pokémon whose Trainer is far away!
Supereffective moves deal even more\ndamage if they are used as Plus Moves!
When moves are used as Plus Moves,\ntheir power is boosted and their area\nof effect becomes larger than usual.
Visit the front desk at Quasartico Inc. to\ntrade your Mega Shards for other items!
Stop by Racine Construction to trade\nyour Colorful Screws for other items!
When battling against a wild Pokémon,\nyou’ll find you can’t do certain things—\nsuch as moving to travel spots.
If you don’t send out your own Pokémon\nwhen facing wild Pokémon, any incoming\nattacks will be directed at you instead!
Want to evolve a Pokémon? You can do\nthat while viewing your current party!
Want to give your Pokémon nicknames?\nYou can do that right from your Boxes!
Pokémon with a high Speed stat won’t\nhave to wait as long to unleash their\nmoves in battle.
If you pick up any Tiny Mushrooms or\nPretty Feathers, feel free to sell them\nat your local Pokémon Center!
If your Pokémon is poisoned, it will\nkeep on losing HP! Be sure to heal it\nup as soon as you can.
Even moves like Protect or Detect don’t\nstand a chance of blocking Plus Moves!
The heavier a Pokémon is, the harder it\nmight be to knock it back with a move.
New moves your Pokémon learn appear in\ntheir Available Moves list. You can change\ncurrent moves from your team or Boxes.
Pokémon received from other Trainers\nin trades gain Exp. Points at a slightly\nhigher rate, making them easier to raise.
This isn’t really a tip at all, but have you\ncounted how many Trainer Tips boards\nLumiose City has in total?
Making good use of Roto-Glide when\nnavigating scaffolding may help you find\nyour way up to some tricky spots.
Buy 10 Poké Balls of the same variety\nin a single purchase to receive one\nPremier Ball on the house!
Word on the street is that there are\nsome places in Lumiose you can only\nreach via the rooftops.
Rumor has it that the more Canari plush\nyou collect, the more mysterious benefits\nyou’ll reap from them!
People say that alpha Pokémon have\nbeen making their homes on the\nrooftops of our fair city.
You’ll often find Flying-type Pokémon\non the roofs of buildings.
Large outbreaks of Mega Crystals\ncan be found growing on rooftops\nat times. Keep an eye out for them!
You can’t jump to any travel spots\nwhen you’re belowground.
There are some species of Pokémon that\nnever show themselves during the day.\nTry searching for them at different times!

Temp Text: Rough Overview
A Trainer wants a Pikachu she can use a\nThunder Stone on. She’s offered to trade\nyou her Heracross in exchange.
The requester says he saw a giant Bunnelby\nin an alleyway outside of the wild zones.\nMeet the requester at the location.
The requester dropped something precious\nin the cemetery, which has now become a\nwild zone. Your job is to retrieve the item.
Distan seems to think that attacking from a\ndistance with long-range moves is the most\nstylish strategy. Take him on in a Pokémon\nbattle to see if he’s right.
The requester says Fairy-type Pokémon are\nher favorites. Take her on in battle using your\nown favorite Pokémon.
A young girl wants to see the Snake\nPokémon Ekans up close. Catch an Ekans\nand show it to her.
A young girl is training hard to become the\nstrongest Kakuna user. Let her show off her\nKakuna in battle.
You’ve been roped into chaperoning a\ngrumpy Slurpuff. Take it to Café Soleil and\nhang out there until Slurpuff is satisfied.
The requester says she is worried about her\nAudino, which is behaving strangely. Maybe\na Pokémon battle will calm Audino down...
Paralysis will slow your Pokémon down,\nwhile poison will gradually drain their HP.\nWhich is stronger? Find out for yourself!
An old gentleman has invited you to join\nwhat seems to be an event showcasing\nBudew. Bring a Budew with you to\nparticipate.
The requester says she wants to make\nperfume using Skiddo leaves. What kind of\naroma will this perfume have?
The requester says she now wants to make\nperfume using snow from Vanillite. What\naroma will the perfume have this time?
The requester has asked for an Abra to play\ntag with. He’s offered to trade you his Riolu\nin exchange.
The requester has recently started a courier\nbusiness. He says he needs an extra-large\nGogoat in order to haul bigger loads. See if\nyou can find one for him.

A strange seed was planted on its back at birth.\nThe plant sprouts and grows with this Pokémon.
There is a plant bulb on its back. When it absorbs\nnutrients, the bulb is said to blossom into a large\nflower.
After a rainy day, the flower on its back smells\nstronger. The scent attracts other Pokémon.
The flame on its tail indicates Charmander’s life\nforce. If it is healthy, the flame burns brightly.
It lashes about with its tail to knock down its foe.\nIt then tears up the fallen opponent with sharp\nclaws.
Its wings can carry this Pokémon close to an\naltitude of 4,600 feet. It blows out fire at very high\ntemperatures.
It hides in its shell to protect itself, then strikes\nback with spouts of water at every opportunity.
When tapped on its head, this Pokémon will pull\nit in, but its tail will still stick out a little bit.
It crushes its foe under its heavy body to cause\nfainting. In a pinch, it will withdraw inside its\nshell.
[~ 10]

Often found in forests and grasslands. It has a\nsharp, toxic barb of around two inches on top of\nits head.
Almost incapable of moving, this Pokémon can\nonly harden its shell to protect itself when it is in\ndanger.
They may appear in a swarm. Beedrill flies at\nviolent speeds, all the while stabbing with the\ntoxic stinger on its rear.
It is docile and prefers to avoid conflict. If\ndisturbed, however, it can ferociously strike back.
This Pokémon has a sprawling territory and will\nfiercely peck at any intruder.
It flies over water as it hunts, skimming along the\nsurface to catch Magikarp and other such prey.
