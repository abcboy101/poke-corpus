If you’re a Trainer and you want to raise your\nPokémon to grow strong, be sure to have them\r\nbattle against wild Pokémon.
The trick to actually hitting a Pokémon with a\nPoké Ball is to focus on it by holding down [VAR BD0A(0002)]ZL!
I’ve got my best buds\nright here with me! [VAR BD0A(000A)]Text_icon1
If you get attacked by wild Pokémon, you’ve got\ntwo choices: Fight back with your own Pokémon,\r\nor run like the wind! You’ll have to decide quick!
[~ 217]
So I crouch down with [VAR BD0A(000C)]Stick_L_Push...\nand then I sneak up close... [VAR BD0A(000A)]Text_icon1
Shhh! There are timid Pokémon around here\nthat’ll run away the instant they spot you.\c\nIf you want to approach Pokémon like that, crouch\nwith [VAR BD0A(000C)]Stick_L_Push and then sneak up, real gentle and quiet.
[~ 220]
Even if we’re surrounded by a wild zone now,\nwe’ve still got a business to run!\c\nSome of our customers still seek us out here, and\nplenty of Pokémon want bread too.
Dang it... My karate skills still aren’t good enough\nfor me to smash boulders.\c\nIf only I was a Pokémon—then I could learn\npowerful moves in an instant using TMs!
[~ 223]
De den.
Dede!
Help! Heeeeeeelp!\nSomebody, please! [VAR BD0A(000A)]Text_icon1
Wild zones found right in the heart of the city!\nPlaces that exist for the sake of wild Pokémon!\c\nIf that idea lights a fire in you, check ’em out and\nbattle wild Pokémon to your heart’s content!
The trick to actually hitting a Pokémon with a\nPoké Ball is to focus on it by holding down [VAR BD0A(0002)]ZL!
You’ve seen those big boulders left around town?\nYou can break ’em with the right Pokémon move.
The power of science is amazing!\c\nThat green light surrounding the wild zone is the\nlatest tech from the folks at Quasartico Inc.!
Shhh! There are timid Pokémon around here\nthat’ll run away the instant they spot you.\c\nIf you want to approach Pokémon like that, crouch\nwith [VAR BD0A(000C)]Stick_L_Push and then sneak up, real gentle and quiet.
You never know what part of town will be picked\nas the next battle zone—not till night falls!\c\nLumiose sure is one exciting city, huh?

Here lies AZ, who mastered both creation and\ndestruction, a man of beginnings and endings.\c\nFor 3,000 years he lived, finding no fellowship\nwith others as he wandered the world’s byways.\c\nBut in Lumiose he discovered faithful friends and\nwas reunited with his most beloved Pokémon.\c\nIt was in Lumiose, too, that he breathed his last.

It’s one of the standing stones that line Route 10\nall the way to the ruins in Geosenge Town.\c\nThese stones apparently behave in a mysterious\nmanner.\c\nThey usually emit energy, but when the ultimate\nweapon is activated, that reverses.\c\nThey then begin to absorb energy from Pokémon\nattached to them.
Machines for controlling vast amounts of energy\nhave been positioned around a stone.\c\nTeam Flare evidently commanded cutting-edge\ntechnology while they were still in operation.
“With the ultimate weapon, we will unleash the\npower of Kalos’s Legendary Pokémon.\c\n“The weapon will be powered by living Pokémon—\nor rather by the life energy they contain.\c\n“To obtain this life energy, we must bind Pokémon\nto the standing stones that line Route 10.”\c\nThere are also details and other plans about the\nultimate weapon written here...

Here you are: one Flamethrower Roast! Savor the\nblend of sour, bitter, and sweet notes.
Here you are: one Fire Blast Roast! This one’s less\nacidic—a nice, bitter, fragrant roast.
Here you are: one Burn Up Roast! This is the\ndarkest roast we’ve got—really rich and bitter.
All right, one Panchamomile Tea! Rich flavor and a\nnice, sweet aroma—plus it packs a real punch!
All right, one Wooloolong Tea! It’s refreshing,\neven if it does smell a bit like wet wool.
All right, one Roserade Tea! This one’s nice and\ngentle, with a great aroma. Popular in Alola, too.
All right, one Moomoo Milk! It’s bursting with\nnutritional value.
All right, one Fresh Water! Apparently ours has\nmore magnesium than in some other regions.
All right, one Sparkling Water! Enjoy a different\nexperience than you get with flat mineral water.

Think I’ll let Pokémon handle\nthe high-up deliveries...
We’ve gotta drive at a crawl around here.\nPokémon might run into the road at any second.
Should I attack from afar\nor get up close first?
If you look in different places, you’ll find different\nPokémon living there.
Are there rare Pokémon here in Lumiose?
I’ll buy as many clothes as it takes to find the\npieces that I truly love!
Boutique Couture is one of Lumiose’s fanciest\nshops, you know?
It’s no surprise hotels are pricey in\na destination city like Lumiose...
Good Pokémon battlers\nare good deal closers!
Clefairy’s strange, otherworldly charm has won it\nmany fans.
Some moves take longer\nto get ready than others.
No way could I be a backpacker without Pokémon\nI can depend on!
Of course I’m different. How could anyone not\nchange in 10 years?
Has it really been 10 years?!\nYou don’t look a bit different!
Help keep Lumiose beautiful—\nsmash every Mega Crystal you see!
Gonna take Vernal\nAvenue at a full sprint!
We should all train with the Fist of Justice. You\nnever know when being prepared might save you.
Whenever you’re heading into a wild zone, you’d\nbest be prepared. Check your items and such.
Having more Pokémon in the city\ncreates more jobs for us people!
I was hoping to go sunbathe on the roof, but\nsome Pokémon got there first.
Seeing the Stone Emporium always makes me\nthink... Why do Pokémon react to certain stones?
Our galettes are the\ntalk of Lumiose. [VAR BD0A(000A)]Text_icon1
Pokémon love our bread\nmore than any other!
Sure, it’s sad to see the city I love change...but it’s\nsweeter yet to consider what it might become!
Classes take forever!\nThey’re so boring!
With all the wild Pokémon around, it’s kinda like\nwe’re living in nature in the middle of the city!
When I’ve got my Pokémon,\nlife always feels luxurious!
Daytime’s when I train my\nPokémon for the Z-A Royale.
Where should we go the next time we all have a\nday off together?
A wild zone!
I wanna watch the Z-A Royale!
Wait, you let your Pokémon out of their Poké Balls\nat your place?
I like to let my Pokémon out of their Poké Balls,\nbut then they take over my bed...
Racine Construction\nhas a whimsical side.
A scaffolding\nobstacle course?!
Lumiose has been around a long time. A lot of the\nshops here have become pretty famous.
Trends live and die so quickly in Lumiose... Even\nthe very word “stylish” feels like a relic these days.
Ground types are weak to...\nWater, Grass, and Ice! ♪
Rumor has it that if you gather those [VAR FF00(0006)]screws[VAR FF00(0000)] lying\naround on the scaffolding and take ’em to Racine\r\nConstruction, you can trade ’em for nice things.
It’s a lucky thing when each day\nis the same as the day before.
You gotta change with the times!\nThis holo-tech stuff is fantastic!
What makes a Pokémon battle artistic? It’s a\ndifficult question...
I feel like me an’ my Pokémon\nare invincible today!
You can’t walk these streets without meeting\nsomeone or something—for better or worse.
Maybe this city—where we live in\nharmony with Pokémon—is art...
I don’t think I can take care\nof more than three Pokémon...
My arm’s itchin’ to\nthrow a Poké Ball!
Lumiose City’s always in SOME kind of trouble.\nRemember that huge blackout a few years ago?
Ohhh, Vernal Avenue...\nOhhh, Vernal Avenue... ♪
Thank goodness I’m still fit enough to enjoy\nstrolling about sampling Lumiose’s lovely food!
Press [VAR BD0A(0005)]Minus to use your camera!\nPreserve your memories in photos!
I’ve got a meeting with Quasartico\nabout the redevelopment plan.
I am afraid Boutique Couture is for none but the\ntruly stylish.
Oho! So stylish—you’re just the sort we like to see\nhere at Boutique Couture.
[~ 54]
I’m gonna be the kind of guy who\nbrings out the best in Spewpa!
Using moves with a wide attack radius to smash\na bunch of Mega Crystals at once feels great!
What’s the name for someone\nborn and raised here? Lumiosian?
You don’t have to use just one Pokémon... Isn’t\nteamwork part of battling?
When you’ve got just one Pokémon, going up\nagainst a type it’s weak to is ROUGH.
I’d like to come back here once the\nurban redevelopment work’s done.
I can’t even remember what this\nplace used to look like anymore...
I’ve got to go undercover and infiltrate this Z-A\nRoyale thing that happens at night...
It’s amazing how Pokémon can find their own\nlittle spots they like, even in the middle of the city.
When I bring out my Pokémon, wild Pokémon\nnotice and come to check it out.
I guess the Pokémon want to feel out how strong\nothers are.
Wish this urban redevelopment\nplan included fixing up my house.
Is anyone studying the impact of\nhaving more wild Pokémon here?
Parcels with Pokémon food in ’em\nattract attention—the hungry sort.
I gotta learn what moves wild\nPokémon know to protect myself!
This place feels pretty different\nfrom the last time I visited.
Some terrifying Pokémon lurk in Lumiose’s back\nalleys...
My wheels got dinged by a Pokémon move.\nWonder if insurance covers that...?
Some Pokémon will evolve as they gain\nExp. Points and level up!
I love playing tag with Pokémon!\nI’ve caught ’em seven times today!
Feels kinda like we’re all\nliving in a Safari Zone lately.
I could travel round the world\nas long as I’ve got my Pokémon!
Great Balls give you a bit of an\nedge in catching Pokémon.
Maybe I’ll have my\nPokémon hold a Berry...
I love collecting TMs, even\nif I have no use for ’em!
I wonder if Pokémon change\nphysically to adapt to urban life.
I don’t bat an eye at the\nconstant howls anymore.
Those huge Pokémon,\nthough! With the eyes!
I dress however I like and\ntrain whatever Pokémon I like.
I don’t see many punk guys\nand the like around lately.
Pokémon are the real stars.\nTrainers are just stagehands.
The most important thing is doing\nbetter than you did yesterday.
My Poké Ball broke...
The Maximizers are coming here\non tour! I simply can’t wait!
It’s getting so you almost can’t\nwalk around without a Pokémon...
If a move misses, don’t dwell on it.\nBelieve you’ll succeed next time!
How do Pokémon know what\nmove we’re telling them to use?
These Mega Crystals—are they in fashion now?\nI’ve been seeing them all over Lumiose.
To the people of Lumiose, cafés are where you\nmeet friends for furious, coffee-fueled debates!
If your moves are all one type, you’ll have no shot\nagainst Pokémon with a type advantage.
You don’t have to worry about that if you go\naround with a balanced Pokémon team.
Mega Crystals pop up faster\nthan I can smash ’em! Why?!
Are artworks with Pokémon motifs more popular\nin general?
Well, just having a Pokémon as the subject and\nnothing else is hardly new or exciting...
Isn’t it bizarre that we can throw a Poké Ball even\nwhen it’s got a 200-pound Pokémon in it?
It’s a wonder that Poké Balls can be so incredible\nand cost only 100 apiece.
Can’t anything be done about the\nnoisy Pokémon on the rooftops?
[~ 102]
An intriguing idea. Seeing as you’ve got Greninja\nprotecting you, I’d support it.
I’d like to sneak out after dark and see Pokémon\nplaying in the city streets at night!
Hmm. It’s key to consider how close to stay to\nyour Pokémon during battle.
Things just feel more right the closer I am to my\nPokémon in battle, y’know?
I bet having their Trainer right close by makes\nPokémon feel brave when they need to fight!
Wonder if I can buy Berries\nin bulk somewhere...
Should I train one Pokémon a lot\nor train up a balanced team?
You can’t win ’em all, so you\ngotta be able to lose well!
In the Z-A Royale, striking first\ncan make all the difference!
DENSOKU sneakers are\nthe best for running in!
I can’t begrudge the youths\nfor having time that I don’t.
You can think about battles twenty-four seven,\nbut that doesn’t guarantee you’ll win!
We’re both very excited to get to see the sights\nhere in Lumiose, and yet...
When you’re traveling with someone who doesn’t\nagree with any of the sights and places you want\r\nto see, it’s hard to settle on anything!
My place feels cramped now that I\nbrought home an alpha Pokémon.
I bet Pokémon would be\nshook if I mimicked their cries.
What would you do if it\nattracted a bunch of ’em?
Some people want to have pedigreed Pokémon. To\neach their own, I guess.
I don’t know my Fletchinder’s birthday, so we\ncelebrate the anniversary of when we met.
Sure, catching a Pokémon makes you its Trainer.\nBut what matters is whether you act the part!
It’s hard to tell if Pokémon are\nwild or if they’re somebody’s!
The best cure for a crushing loss is\nfine food and a good night’s sleep.
I think my Canari plush has made\nme better at catching Pokémon!
Where was that shop again?\nPassage...something or other?
If you take someone’s Pokémon,\nthat makes you a thief!
I’m different than the furisode\ngirls from the Johto region.
It’s so hard to decide when it’s\nworth risking an Ultra Ball...
I’m sure there’d be demand for a\nPokémon battle tutoring service.
Slowpoke’s Water Gun is\ngreat for cleaning the tub.
Life is like a\ntwinkling star!
My Pumpkaboo eats like a real gourmand when\nwe’re in Lumiose.
I’m with the Pokédex Research Society! If I were\nto write a Pokédex entry for Vanillish, it’d say...\c\n“Vanillish create their own energy by drinking\nwater from rivers, lakes, and the like and then\r\nusing their internal organs to produce chilled air.”
I want to be good enough at Pokémon battles to\nbe able to recover from using a wrong move.
More powerful moves tend to\ntake a bit longer to fire off.
Berries that halve damage from\nsupereffective moves are handy!
The more people there are\naround, the lonelier I feel...
I’m gonna make friends\nwith sooo many Pokémon!
If no one picks up litter, wild Pokémon will make\nan even bigger mess with it.
Supereffective moves hit with more power...and\neven more so when they’re Plus Moves!
Never try to stand in the\nway of someone’s dreams!
A ham sandwich with butter\nmakes a power-packed breakfast.
Everyone should walk more!\nYou never know what you’ll see!
I’m never sure what item I\nshould have my Litleo hold.
Oh please! Even with a full party, you always\npanic about which one to send out...
With enough Pokémon in your party, you’ll be\nable to handle whatever you run into!
Flower nectar looks tasty.\nNo wonder Pokémon drink it!
Sometimes I just wanna\nFire Blast something...
I wanna make a\nteam of six alphas!
If people miss my deliveries,\nthey gotta come pick ’em up.
I’m the type who likes to squeeze\nin a quick run during my break.
There’s no point crying if you lose.\nTears don’t water flowers, they say.
How will Prism Tower\ntransform next, I wonder?
[~ 155]
I came to see stuff about Team\nFlare, but I’m getting nowhere...
Which is cooler—Pokémon or taxis?
Well, a Skiddo can only carry one rider, but a taxi\ncan hold a few people, right?\c\nThat doesn’t mean one is better than the other.\nIt’s more about what you need!
Just imagine...a car that Pokémon\nmoves can’t smash into tiny bits...
You may think the Society of Battle Connoisseurs\nare just idle rich kids. Don’t underestimate them!\c\nWord is they’re powering up their Pokémon with\nthe best training all their money can buy.
Hit ’em with moves they’re weak to! If you can’t\ndo that, soften ’em up with moves like Tail Whip!
So...give myself a leg up, and give my opponent a\na leg down! Got it!
I catch all my Pokémon\nwith plain old Poké Balls.
It’s not like you have to battle\nevery wild Pokémon you see.
I hired a professional\nto train my Pokémon.
If you use a Plus Move that’s super effective, it\nhits even harder!
I want an alpha Pokémon\nto protect me from stuff!
Straight roads are great!\nThey beg to be sprinted on!
I want to meet all\nkinds of Pokémon!
I got woken up by my\nPokémon’s snoring.
I’ll never forget the\nfirst Pokémon I met.
People and Pokémon alike need to be able to live\nfreely and be treated the way they deserve.
We can’t see into people’s minds.\nAll we can do is see each other!
If you get too hung up on not wanting to lose, you\nstop battling altogether. That’s not the answer!
Me and my Pokémon battle over\nfood every meal, morning to night!
I’ve wanted to try a night at\nHotel Richissime my whole life.
It’s hard to explain to tourists\nwhy your city is the way it is...
If everyone started wearing a\nfurisode like me, I’d blend right in.
No amount of strength training\ncan beat Pokémon muscles!
I want a Strange Souvenir\nfrom the Alola region!
I have my Pokémon handle the\nusual stops on my delivery route.
Do Pokémon actually want to live\nalongside people in the first place?
The Pokémon within my Poké Balls...\c\nThey’re looking...at YOU!
So we’ll keep getting more wild zones, eh? Maybe\nI oughta try living in one. Guess I’d never get\r\nlonely surrounded by Pokémon.
There’s too much to see!\nI’ll just have to move here!
My partner Houndour knows\nmoves that work at a distance.
Time you choose to spend\nalone is still time well spent.
Trainers need to be trained\njust as much as Pokémon do!
What disappears is gone, and\nwhatever’s left can only remain.
Ever since I was a child, I’ve wondered...why do\ncafés flourish so in Lumiose?
I’d say we know the value of taking things slow\nand making time to enjoy a nice break in a café.
I’d love to see that exhibition\nat the Lumiose Museum!
Did people and Pokémon live\ntogether three thousand years ago?
They say Pokémon you get in trades grow a bit\nfaster than others.
Perhaps, but I simply don’t want to trade\nPokémon with anybody right now!
I forget what we learned in school,\nbut I remember Pokémon’s names!
My partners keep getting\nstronger and stronger!
Sometimes I manage a whole lap\naround Lumiose lost in thought.
My Pokémon at home comes\nand goes through the window.
[~ 200]
The perpetual flowing of water keeps it clean. I\nsuppose the city, too, needs to keep on changing.
No way! But Magikarp flop\nand splash around so much!
Magikarp are so weak, the\ncurrent sweeps ’em downriver!
[~ 204]
Maybe I’ll play tag with my\nPokémon around the tower.
Prism Tower’s enormous\nsize is right and true.
Now that I’ve made it to Centrico\nPlaza, I’ll decide where to go.
I wonder if competing to climb ranks will become\nmore mainstream than collecting badges.
This city must be getting tough for\npeople who don’t like Pokémon.
Forget living in the districts—\nI wanna live in the tower!
I wonder if Ivor from the Fist of\nJustice could smash Prism Tower?
Apparently they used to hold quizzes and\nPokémon battles inside Prism Tower.
I heard the siblings who used to rule the tower\nwere really close.\c\nThe brother was a great inventor, and the sister\nwas an absolute quiz master!
It’d be cool to glide from the\ntower with my Rotom Phone...
I heard this lady called Jacinthe\ntried to buy the tower for herself!
Wish I could fling all my parcels\nfrom the top of the tower.
So many people come here. It’s\na good place for a battle court!
I’m pretty sure I read Prism Tower is nearly one\nthousand feet tall...
The redevelopment plan should\nnever have closed the city’s symbol.
I should do some kind of street\nperformance with my Pokémon.
I’d never want to climb the tower,\nbut I still liked knowing I could...
One day I’ll be even\nbigger than Prism Tower!
People and Pokémon gather here\nsince the tower’s so easy to spot.
Are there bird Pokémon that roost on top of Prism\nTower?
Perhaps some kind of Legendary Pokémon or\nsomething might dare alight upon the tower!
I miss looking over Lumiose\nfrom the observation deck.
Check out Prism Tower!\nWhy’s it glowing like that?
This is...wild—so wild my\nvocabulary’s failing me.
We gotta make\nsure everyone’s OK.
Is all this weirdness\nQuasartico’s doing?

Well, you’re in luck, friend. I’ve had zero accidents\nor violations in my entire time as a cabbie!\c\n’Course that doesn’t mean I’ll always be accident-\nfree, but I’m gonna drive extra safe.\c\nCan’t go getting injured if I want to keep battling\nin the Z-A Royale![VAR 0114(002F)]
Did I ever tell you how I manage to stay accident-\nfree, friend?\c\nIt’s kinda hard to explain, to be honest... When\nI’m driving, it’s like I can see myself from above,\r\nyou know? I’m able to look down at my own cab\r\nand everything going on around it.\c\nSo I can stay safe around other vehicles, and I can\neven tell when a Pokémon’s gonna leap out.\r\nThat’s why I’m such a safe driver.[VAR 0114(002F)]
Say, did I ever tell you I used to be a racer?\c\nIt’s true! I used to participate in those 24-hour\nraces. You know what those are?\c\nWe’d drive around the same track over and over\nto check a car’s stability, stuff like that.\c\nIt was fun, actually—making sure the vehicle was\nsafe in extreme situations, all while trying to\r\nshave an extra 0.1 seconds off our time.\c\nStill, I figured it would be more fun driving\ncustomers to wherever they wanted to go, so I\r\nswitched jobs and became a cabbie.[VAR 0114(002F)]
Say, friend, did I ever tell you what the most\nimportant thing is for us cabbies?\c\nDon’t get me wrong, a lot of things are important,\nbut I’d say keeping track of Lumiose traffic is the\r\nhighest priority for us.\c\nMe? I’ve got it all memorized—which roads get\ncrowded at what times, the whole deal. And all\r\nthat changes if it rains, for example—right?\c\nI mean, of course it does. Some Pokémon like the\nrain and some don’t, after all.[VAR 0114(002F)]
Y’know, I had this cool encounter during my shift\nonce. Want to hear about it?\c\nWell, this story is from back when people could\nuse the Gogoat Shuttle to get around Lumiose.\c\n’Course, that service had to be discontinued, what\nwith all the new Pokémon living in town.\c\nAnyway, I had a customer who said he was an\nofficer with the International Police!\c\nAnd wouldn’t you know it, he gets in my cab and\nsays “follow that car!”\c\nI knew it was my moment to shine, you know? I\nknow Lumiose like the back of my hand, after all.\c\nWhat happened, you ask? Naturally we were able\nto catch the fleeing criminal! I even got an award\r\nfor my part in the whole thing![VAR 0114(002F)]
Say, friend, do you know the airspeed velocity of\nan unladen Skarmory?\c\nSorry, it’s a random question, isn’t it? But they do\ngo really fast—over 180 miles per hour, in fact.\r\nThat’s too fast even for my cab to catch up with.\c\nBut see, I actually had to chase one down... Yes,\nthat’s right, I had a car chase with a Pokémon!\c\nThe Skarmory was trying to get away, but I used\nmy knowledge of Lumiose and my driving skills to\r\nbring it in.\c\nI figured if it’s flying, I’d fly too! So I predicted the\nroute it’d take, launched my car off a ramp, and\r\nsnagged myself a nice catch.[VAR 0114(002F)]
By the way, do you know who keeps our cabs in\ntip-top shape?\c\nThe company mechanics, of course! Well, most of\nthe time. See, I operate as an independent cabbie,\r\nso I have to maintain my car myself.\c\nI’m more than just an excellent driver—I may not\nlook it, but I’m also a pretty decent mechanic!\c\nMy car’s never had any kind of mechanical failure.\nI get a lot of respect from my mechanic buddies, I\r\ntell you what![VAR 0114(002F)]
Hope you don’t mind listening to me ramble a bit,\nfriend, but did I tell you the first time I ever drove\r\na car was when I was three years old?\c\nWell, Rhyhorn racing’s really popular in Kalos,\nright? My old man’s a huge fan too. He wanted\r\nme to become a Rhyhorn racer!\c\nSo he let me drive around in one of those go-karts\nto get me used to the speed.\c\nAnd that’s what set me up for life! I was able to\ndrift and everything, without anyone teaching me.\c\nYou could say I’m a natural behind the wheel, but\nbeing a cabbie is only my second favorite thing in\r\nlife right now.[VAR 0114(002F)]
Say, friend, do you know the Pokémon Trainer\nLeon?\c\nHe’s quite the customer, let me tell you. Everyone\nknows how easily he gets lost, but I didn’t expect\r\nit to happen while he was in my cab!\c\nSee, I think of myself as one of the better cabbies\nin Lumiose, and I know this city inside and out.\c\nBut somehow, when Leon was my fare, things\nkept happening that’d take us farther and farther\r\naway from where we wanted to go!\c\nI did finally manage to get Leon to his destination,\nbut man, what a weird experience...[VAR 0114(002F)]
Have you ever seen a cab haul a Pokémon?\c\nOh—of course, if they’re in their Poké Balls, then\na cab could carry any number of them. I’m talking\r\nabout a wild Pangoro.\c\nI came across one that was badly injured—it\nmust’ve had a fight with another Pokémon.\c\nI couldn’t just leave it there, so I got it on the roof\nof my cab to take it to a Pokémon Center.\c\nBut the light on the car roof must’ve rubbed it in a\npainful way, because the Pangoro started\r\nthrashing around.\c\nI used my driving skills to get it to a Pokémon\nCenter as fast as I could, driving at the exact\r\nspeed limit the whole time!\c\nThat was some mighty fine driving, if I do say so\nmyself.\c\nAll these wild Pokémon in the city, though... They\ndefinitely changed how we do things here.[VAR 0114(002F)]
By the by, friend—something tells me you’re one\nof the Trainers in the Z-A Royale.\c\nIt’s so much fun, isn’t it? I’m taking part myself,\nbut I can’t win a promotion match for the life of\r\nme. Now everyone calls me Le Z Éternel.\c\nStill, it’s such an intense experience. I wouldn’t\nmiss it for the world.[VAR 0114(002F)]
Are you a Pokémon Trainer, friend? I happen to be\na Trainer too, but I can’t say I’m very good.\c\nWhen I’m driving I see everything—other cars, my\nsurroundings—as if I’m watching from above.\c\nBut in a Pokémon battle, all I can think about is\nhow to defeat the Pokémon right in front of me.\r\nWhat do you think I should do?[VAR 0114(002F)]
Are you a Pokémon Trainer, friend? I happen to be\na Trainer too.\c\nI managed to memorize all the type matchups, but\nthat’s some complicated stuff! Goes right out of\r\nmy head the minute a battle begins.[VAR 0114(002F)]
Are you taking part in the Z-A Royale? How’re the\npromotion matches treating you?\c\nMe, I can’t seem to win at all. I’ve been stuck at\nRank Z for so long, people call me Le Z Éternel.\c\nSee, I don’t mind people poking a bit of fun at me,\nbut I do take issue when they make fun of my\r\nPokémon. My critters always try their very best![VAR 0114(002F)]
Are you taking part in the Z-A Royale? I’ve been\nneck-deep in it myself.\c\nMy work used to be what kept me going, but now\nall I can think about is the Z-A Royale.\r\nIt’s almost like I’ve betrayed a loved one, actually.\c\nIt’s been forever since I even took my cab for a\nwash... I hope it’s not mad at me.[VAR 0114(002F)]
Say, friend, do you know about the detective\nnamed Emma?\c\nShe’s young but a brilliant sleuth nonetheless.\nThough she tends to rely on her physical prowess\r\nand Trainer skills over deductive reasoning to\r\nsolve cases.\c\nHer showdown with the art thieves who tried to\nrob the Lumiose Museum is still a hot topic!\c\nSee, there was this group of thieves who used\nPokémon to sneak into the museum and rob the\r\nplace. But when they tried to make their escape,\r\nEmma was right there waiting for them.\c\nIt’s as if she had used Future Sight or something!\c\nIn the end, the thieves all got caught, and since\nthen, nobody’s tried to rob the museum—though\r\nPokémon do still sneak in from time to time.[VAR 0114(002F)]
Were you around when we had that big parade,\nfriend?\c\nBack then, a lot was going on in Lumiose—in the\nwhole Kalos region, actually.\c\nThere was this group called Team Flare, and they\nactivated something called the ultimate weapon...\c\nSome actually thought it was the end of the\nworld. So then a Pokémon Professor planned a\r\nbig parade to cheer everyone up, but...\c\nWell, it didn’t really work. Folks were still scared,\nand they started leaving Lumiose.\c\nPart of the reason we have a redevelopment plan\nis to stop the exodus of people. That plan was the\r\nstart of some big changes for this city.[VAR 0114(002F)]
Say, have you heard about the ghost here in\nLumiose?\c\nThe story goes that there’s an elevator in a certain\nbuilding... Ride it up to the second floor, and as\r\nyou get off, a girl suddenly appears behind you\r\nand says, “No, you’re not the one...”\r\nThen she vanishes!\c\nUsed to be that I’d hear that story all the time, but\nme and my cabbie buddies were saying that we\r\nhaven’t heard about it since all the Pokémon\r\nstarted living here.\c\nThen again, I’ve heard another story these days...\nOne about a girl who’s somehow riding your cab\r\nwithout you ever having let her on.\c\nI hear all she says is, “You’re not the one, either...”[VAR 0114(002F)]
Have you heard the story about the first ever\nMega Evolution here in Kalos?\c\nAs it goes, a long, long time ago, a Trainer with a\nLucario came to visit the Tower of Mastery.\c\nWhile they were in the area, they found two\nstrange stones.\c\nAs it turns out, one was a Key Stone, same as the\none on a Mega Ring.\c\nThe other was a Mega Stone, just like the one\nyou’d give to your Pokémon![VAR 0114(002F)]
You know, friend, I ran into a traveling minstrel\nonce, and they told me quite the tale.\c\n“The Kalos region, now upheld as fair,\nFrom ancient days an ugly past doth bear.\c\nThe woes of war did knock on every door,\nTill man nor Pokémon could take no more,\r\nThree thousand years ago, upon this shore.\c\nSo many lives were lost—both man and ’mon.\nIt seemed a night that ne’er would bring dawn.\c\nNo beauty, no joy in those days of yore;\nOnly the pain of parting was in store\r\nFor victims of the ancient Kalos war.\c\nMan’s grief brought the end, the land did tear,\nWartime finished in a lightning flare.\c\n’Mon’s rage brought the end, a furious roar,\nLightning crackled forth to end the war—\r\nKalos’s long pain was then no more.\c\nOne man, through it all, lives ever on.\nTo a Pokémon once lost, he’s ever drawn.\c\nOne man, through it all, lives ever on.\nSearching for his heart, long lost and gone.\c\nAt last his labors brought end to his chore.\nBountiful kindness from his heart did pour,\r\nHis Pokémon to part with nevermore.”\c\nCan you imagine wandering the world for three\nthousand years? Don’t think I could ever do it...\r\nWell, maybe if I had my cab, I could.[VAR 0114(002F)]
Oh, hey, here’s your stop![VAR 0114(002F)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]We’re [VAR 01D3(0002)],\nas\r\nrequested.\c\nThat’ll be 710, if you don’t mind![VAR 0114(002F)]
Hey, now... I didn’t expect someone earning in the\nZ-A Royale to come up short on cash.[VAR 0114(002F)]
Hope to see you again soon![VAR 0114(002F)]
[~ 94]
Then here we go!
Say, boss, did you know that Prism Tower’s been\nremodeled and renovated a few times?\c\nI hear its...skeleton? Its framework? The insides,\nwhatever you call them, are pretty old.
Did you know that the Gare de Lumiose was built\nfour years ago as part of the railway connecting\r\nLumiose to the airport?\c\nFunny thing is, only Pokémon showed up to the\ngrand opening ceremony! I’m glad they like the\r\ntrain, but Pokémon aren’t paying customers...
Did you know that each Pokémon move has its\nown area of effect, boss?\c\nApparently, moves with large areas of effect can\nhit multiple opponents at once!
You know how Mega Power gets charged up each\ntime a Pokémon uses a move, right, boss?\c\nWell, here’s the thing... Word on the street is that\nPokémon don’t get as much Mega Power if their\r\nTrainer is far away!
Hey, boss, have you run into a driver named\nZach yet?\c\nHe’s a buddy of mine who also works as a cabbie,\nbut nowadays all he talks about is the Z-A Royale.\r\nBarely does any driving, you know?\c\nIn fact, folks have started saying it’s good luck to\ncatch a ride in his cab, given how rare that is.\c\nWhat’s more, I hear he’s not doing too great in\nthe Z-A Royale, either. Guess liking something\r\ndoesn’t make you good at it, eh?\c\nMaybe you’ll bump into him next time you’re\nbattling in the Z-A Royale.
By the way, boss, you know any good restaurants\nhere in Lumiose?\c\nI know, I know, you’d think a taxi driver would\nknow all about that sort of thing.\c\nBut the problem is I can just go anywhere since\nI have a car, so I always end up going to little\r\nout-of-the-way places.\c\nMy customers ask me all the time about popular\nplaces to eat around here, but really, I’m the one\r\nwho wants to know!\c\nSpeaking of—you wanna know something we\ncabbies look for when choosing a place to eat?\c\nA parking spot where wild Pokémon won’t\ndestroy our cars, that’s what!
... ... ...\n... ... ...\c\n... ... ...\n... ... ...\c\n... ... ...\n... ... ...\c\n... ... ...\n... ... ...
Hey, uh, boss, do you...\c\nNo, never mind. I’m sure it’s nothing.
Did I mention I love to make curry, boss? It’s a\nhobby of mine, actually. I even get all my spices\r\nshipped in from the Galar region.
You ever seen a Shiny Pokémon, boss? I actually\nsaw one while I was driving a customer around.\c\nBut the guy was in a hurry—I couldn’t just pull\nover to catch a Pokémon. Don’t you hate it when\r\nthat kind of thing happens?
Oh, we’re almost there! Time flies when you’re\nchatting, am I right?
Okie dokie, here we are, boss! Safe and sound\n[VAR 01D3(0002)]!\c\nThat’ll be, uhhh...710.
Hey, what’s the deal?! You don’t have enough\nmoney!
Until next time, then!
[~ 110]
Make sure you fasten your seat belt.
By the way, do you like Sushi High Roller?\c\nI eat there from time to time, but I can never resist\nordering one of their full courses. The Pokémon\r\nbattles take up my whole break!\c\nI hear Sushi High Roller has branches in other\nregions too, actually.
Did you know the Gare de Lumiose was used to\nfilm a movie? It starred a big-name actor too.\c\nPeople came from all over the place to catch a\nglimpse of her. It was pretty wild around here!
Did you know that each Pokémon move has a\nspecific range?\c\nThat means it’s possible for a move to fall short\nof the opponent if they’re far enough away!\c\nI guess the important thing when choosing a\nmove is to make sure your opponent is in range.
You know how it takes Pokémon a little time\nbefore they can use the same move again?\c\nWell, I’ve heard people say that if a Pokémon has\na high Speed stat, that time gets reduced a bit!
You probably know that there are lots of ways for\nPokémon to evolve, but did you know that some\r\nPokémon won’t evolve unless you’re really\r\nfriendly with them?\c\nIf you wanna get closer to your Pokémon, the best\nthing to do is spend time with them at a café!
Hey, have you heard about the cup of coffee that\ngoes for 100,000?\c\nI’ve never had it myself, obviously, but I have to\nwonder how it tastes...
Have you been using your Boxes to store your\nPokémon? One Box can hold up to 30 of them!\c\nYou’ll only have access to eight Boxes at first, but\ndon’t worry—the more Pokémon you deposit, the\r\nmore Boxes you’ll have.\c\nBy the way, you can also swap the positions of\nentire Boxes at once!
Say, did I mention I’m really good at making\nsandwiches? I get all my ingredients from the\r\nPaldea region, even!
This is a bit out of nowhere, but you know how\nsome people get nervous with too much quiet?\c\nWell, I had a customer like that, so I suggested a\nPokémon naming game.\c\n“Let’s name every Pokémon we can think of that\ndoesn’t evolve!” I said.\c\nWell, guess which Pokémon they named first?\nEevee.\c\n...Yeah, the ride got really awkward really quickly.
So, you’re riding by yourself today, is that right?\n...No, no, it’s nothing.\c\nUh, actually, sorry to keep asking about this, but\nyou DID get in the taxi alone, right?\c\nOh...don’t mind me. I’m probably just seeing\nthings...
Ah, here’s your destination coming up.
I hope you enjoyed your ride! We’ve now arrived\n[VAR 01D3(0002)]!\c\nThat’ll be 710, thanks.
Hey, wait a sec! You don’t have enough for the full\nfare! Goodness me...
See you around!

You again? Shocking, considering what a “Rank X”\nvibe you had back when we first met.[VAR 0114(0031)]
Being pressed into a corner is what pushes me to\nget serious! Don’t I sound cool when I say that?[VAR 0114(0031)]
I understand why you made it all the way to\nRank A.[VAR 0114(0031)]
I’m going to make Restaurant Le Nah into a three-\nstar restaurant! You wait and see![VAR 0114(0032)]
The sorrow of reaching the last course in a meal...\nThe fear of being down to your last Pokémon...[VAR 0114(0032)]
At least my restaurant can say that one of its staff\nbattled the first Trainer to ever reach Rank A.\r\nThat’s a reason to be famed as well, right?[VAR 0114(0032)]
I, Josée—probably the fifth-strongest disciple in\nthe Fist of Justice—am ready to throw down![VAR 0114(0033)]
I won’t panic, even if I seem to be on the ropes.\nI’ll prove I’ve learned from Ivor-sensei’s lessons![VAR 0114(0033)]
Thank you for the bout! Come by the dojo anytime\nyou want to work on your Plus Moves![VAR 0114(0033)]
The prodigious knowledge I have perfected as a\nquiz master will have me well-suited to win this![VAR 0114(0035)]
I am certain my knowledge is impeccable, and yet\nI am down to a single Pokémon...[VAR 0114(0035)]
I never miss a multiple-choice quiz question, yet\nchoosing a correct move is surprisingly complex.[VAR 0114(0035)]
What’s this? Will winning this battle make me\nseem even more stylish?[VAR 0114(003A)]
I’ll have my last Pokémon defeat you...with style![VAR 0114(003A)]
Don’t forget—you can become as chic as me if\nyou come shop at Boutique Couture![VAR 0114(003A)]
[~ 82]
We’re so lucky—we found strong rivals in each\nother, and we get to battle all out![VAR 0114(0006)]
I’m glad we get to battle you—it lets us break\nright through the limits we thought we had![VAR 0114(0006)]
Ugh. Losing is rough...but battling you is so\nmuch fun!\c\nMy feelings are all over the place, but one thing I\nknow for sure is...you’re the best![VAR 0114(0006)]
Lucky us, right? Not a lot of people get to have\nall-out battles with their strongest rival![VAR 0114(0005)]
I’m glad we get to battle you—it lets us break\nright through the limits we thought we had![VAR 0114(0005)]
Ugh. I can’t stand losing...but battling you is so\nmuch fun!\c\nMy feelings are all over the place, but one thing I\nknow for sure is...you’re the best![VAR 0114(0005)]
I’m here to prove my strength as the Looker\nBureau’s current head detective![VAR 0114(0008)]
I need to be strong if I want to keep my promise to\nprotect the peace in Lumiose![VAR 0114(0008)]
I hope I can count on your help when something\ncomes up, [VAR 0100(0000)].\c\nAfter all, you’re kind of an honorary assistant\naround the Looker Bureau![VAR 0114(0008)]
Funny... It wasn’t long ago at all that I helped you\nbecome Canari Quiz Whiz. How far we’ve come.[VAR 0114(000B)]
My whole party’s earned its place in Team MZ!\nScrafty, show them how you did it![VAR 0114(000B)]
Well, I can still beat you when it comes to fashion\nand sewing...and my knowledge as a Canatic![VAR 0114(000B)]
I’m gonna beat you before you can even get over\nhow amazing Mega Starmie’s dance moves are![VAR 0114(000C)]
All right, Starmie! Everyone on Team MZ’s pulling\nfor you. Show ’em your Mega Evolution steps![VAR 0114(000C)]
I don’t care how I do in the Infinite Z-A Royale. All\nI really want is for my big bro to see me dancing![VAR 0114(000C)]
I’m afraid I really must win this battle. It was a\nrequest from my adorable daughter.[VAR 0114(000E)]
Drampa, our hearts are perfectly aligned! Let us\nshow them what Mega Evolution can really do![VAR 0114(000E)]
My daughter also asked that I help make this a\ncity where we can live alongside Pokémon.\c\nOf course, I’d already been tasked with that work.\nBut I am more motivated now than ever, hearing\r\nthe request come from my baby girl.[VAR 0114(000E)]
Me and my team prefer close-range combat. Hope\nyou’re ready to lose![VAR 0114(000F)]
Me and Eelektross are gonna shock your socks\noff with our ultimate, unbeatable Mega Evolution![VAR 0114(000F)]
We gotta respect each other’s space—we might\nwanna get close, but they might wanna be far.\c\nWhether it’s Pokémon or people, everyone’s got\ntheir own comfort level.[VAR 0114(000F)]
I’m gonna rack up wins in this Infinite Z-A Royale\nso I can redesign this city to my likin’![VAR 0114(0010)]
Whether it’s course buildin’ or Mega Evolvin’, no\none can beat my Excadrill![VAR 0114(0010)]
Things’ve been pretty chaotic in this city these\npast few years. But when times get tough, that’s\r\nwhen ya learn who ya can lean on![VAR 0114(0010)]
One must be strong to claim victory in battle.\nBut...what sort of strength is needed, I wonder?[VAR 0114(0011)]
Falinks! Mega Evolve into justice incarnate![VAR 0114(0011)]
Deep down, I knew it all along. Strength of heart\nis far more important than muscular strength if\r\nyou wish to live in harmony with Pokémon...[VAR 0114(0011)]
Victory will be mine.[VAR 0114(0012)]
Chandelure... Mega Evolve for justice’s sake...[VAR 0114(0012)]
I’ll get you next time.[VAR 0114(0012)]
I only ask people to work for my organization so\nthey can gain a better appreciation for our city!\c\nAnd I’ve got a nice big list of tasks for anyone\nwho loses to me![VAR 0114(0013)]
Scolipede! Mega Evolve and show them all how\nstrong our bonds are![VAR 0114(0013)]
It’s strange the pull this city has, isn’t it? Even an\noutsider like me came to love it like I do.[VAR 0114(0013)]
I will do anything within my power to support the\nboss—that is the duty of any loyal follower.[VAR 0114(0014)]
Skarmory, let’s show them how we were before\nwe met the boss—vicious and unrelenting![VAR 0114(0014)]
I should go report the results of our battle to\nMr. Corbeau.\c\nHearing about matches against you seems to\nbring him great joy.[VAR 0114(0014)]
Improving a city means improving its inhabitants.\c\nSuch is the duty of all elites, and thus the reason\nwhy I must defeat you![VAR 0114(0015)]
Behold the apex of the SBC’s power! Prepare to\nbe dazzled by our magnificent Mega Evolution![VAR 0114(0015)]
I aim to win so that I may create something even\nmore enjoyable than either the Infinite Z-A Royale\r\nor Le Super-Tournoi de Jacinthe Infinite![VAR 0114(0015)]
Winning in the Infinite Z-A Royale will get me the\nstrength I need to break free from Jacinthe![VAR 0114(0016)]
Battles are for breaking free of your boundaries!\nDragalge, give me everythin’ you got![VAR 0114(0016)]
Deep down...I know Jacinthe cares about me.\nShe’s just got a weird way of showing it.[VAR 0114(0016)]
I may have been called Gris—gray as ash—but my\nfire has not yet burned out.\c\nThe flames of hope keep me alight! And they are\nwhy I’ll face you again and again![VAR 0114(0017)]
We’re going to burn so bright, we’ll be blinding.\nLet’s ignite with Mega Evolution, Charizard![VAR 0114(0017)]
Every time that I go all out against you in battle,\nI feel the flames raging inside me quiet a little...\r\nand burn on, steadier and stronger than before.[VAR 0114(0017)]
I’m not giving up! If I win this time, you’re totally\ncoming to work at Nouveau Café as my lackey![VAR 0114(0018)]
Nouveau is all about building a new life for\nourselves! Let’s Mega Evolve into something new![VAR 0114(0018)]
I’m still thinking bigger than Nouveau Café, you\nknow. I want to be able to save even more people![VAR 0114(0018)]
There’s something I noticed, being the amazing\ncabbie that I am...\c\nPokémon battles are like driving a car—it’s all\nabout keeping control of the situation.[VAR 0114(002F)]
Whoops! Looks like my tank is nearly empty![VAR 0114(002F)]
OK, so I may be an amazing cabbie, but it looks\nlike I’m doomed to stay a third-rate Trainer.[VAR 0114(002F)]
Let’s get this over with already.\c\nThat’s what I’d normally think, but no... I’m going\nto take my time and savor this battle![VAR 0114(0030)]
If you stop running, then you’ll never make it to\nthe goal! We’ve got to keep pressing on![VAR 0114(0030)]
My poor Lumiose City marathon...\c\nMaybe if I say that people could take part with\ntheir Pokémon, I could drum up some support?[VAR 0114(0030)]
We’ve moved beyond the age of ranks! We live in\nthe infinite now—a world of endless battle![VAR 0114(0031)]
Being doomed to lose again and again... Yes, that\nwould be one way to make battles feel endless...[VAR 0114(0031)]
Do you think you’d regret it if you spent your\nwhole life battling and never became a master?\c\nI wouldn’t. The path to becoming a master has no\nend. It is the very definition of infinite![VAR 0114(0031)]
I know I’ve said it before, but I swear I’ll make\nRestaurant Le Nah into a three-star restaurant![VAR 0114(0032)]
You’ve got to have something that’s just OK to\ncompare to, or you’ll never know what’s great![VAR 0114(0032)]
What if I were to make Restaurant Le Nah the\nabsolute best among all the one-star restaurants?\r\nWouldn’t that make it three-star quality in a way?[VAR 0114(0032)]
Do I really enjoy unlocking Plus Moves, or do I\njust love gathering Seeds of Mastery?\c\nI, Josée, will ignore these seeds of doubt to fight![VAR 0114(0033)]
I’ll battle on, for the sake of all the Pokémon who\ngave their all for me![VAR 0114(0033)]
You want to know why I like Seeds of Mastery?\nIt seems to run in my family. We all love them![VAR 0114(0033)]
I will prove my devotion to my beloved Canari\nthrough absolute domination in this battle![VAR 0114(0035)]
I must put it all on the line with this last solitary\nPokémon of mine![VAR 0114(0035)]
Did you catch that holo-meet-and-greet with\nCanari the other day?\c\nOf course I can tell when it’s Tarragon behind the\nhologram, but that doesn’t stop me from going.\c\nIf it’s for Canari, I will gladly pay good money...\neven for a free handshake with that old imposter![VAR 0114(0035)]
There’s nothing more vogue than defeating\neveryone who comes at me in the Z-A Royale![VAR 0114(003A)]
I’ll have my last Pokémon defeat you...with style![VAR 0114(003A)]
Come shop at Boutique Couture. You’ll gain a\nbetter understanding of yourself—and of battling.\c\nWe now live in an age when each of us decides\nfor ourselves what is truly stylish.[VAR 0114(003A)]
You know, trends come and go when it comes to\nbattle, as they do in fashion.\c\nEveryone has to decide their own style, whether\nthat means battling the way they prefer or chasing\r\nthe latest strategies to stay in vogue.[VAR 0114(003A)]
Even when cornered, as long as we remain chic,\nwe’re still stylish![VAR 0114(003A)]
Trop chic! Very stylish indeed!\c\nRemaining refined, yet flowing with the latest\ntrends... That flexibility is très stylish![VAR 0114(003A)]
Battling against me was the very first memory you\nmade in Lumiose, right?\c\nWell, let’s stroll down memory lane![VAR 0114(002C)]
You’re not the only one here who’s gotten strong!\nI’ll show you how different I am from back then![VAR 0114(002C)]
You can still really hold your own in battle...but\nthat doesn’t make losing to you feel any better![VAR 0114(002C)]
[~ 158]
My Pokémon and I are gonna battle you with the\nfull force of everything we’re feeling![VAR 0114(0006)]
I’m glad we get to battle you—and keep breaking\nright through the limits we thought we had![VAR 0114(0006)]

Feel all my gratitude, Scrafty! Let it fill you with\nthe power of Mega Evolution![VAR 0114(000B)]
Our days in Lumiose have been so wild, they’ve\nmade me stronger in all kinds of ways![VAR 0114(000C)]
Get ready to see where we REALLY shine! C’mon,\nStarmie—Mega Evolve and break it down![VAR 0114(000C)]
Lumiose City is a truly great metropolis. And I’ll\nmake it even greater once I’ve won![VAR 0114(000E)]
Drampa, our hearts are perfectly aligned! Let us\nshow them what Mega Evolution can really do![VAR 0114(000E)]
I’m gonna power DYN4MO up...by beatin’ ya and\nabsorbin’ Team MZ into our ranks![VAR 0114(000F)]
Me and Eelektross are gonna shock your socks\noff with our ultimate, unbeatable Mega Evolution![VAR 0114(000F)]
I’m gonna rack up wins in this Infinite Z-A Royale\nso I can redesign this city to everybody’s likin’![VAR 0114(0010)]
Do ya know how Excadrill Mega Evolves? We\nbond over how badly we wanna win![VAR 0114(0010)]
You all have taught me about kinds of strength I’d\nnever known. This battle is how I say thank you![VAR 0114(0011)]
Falinks! Mega Evolve into justice incarnate![VAR 0114(0011)]
I will win.[VAR 0114(0012)]
Chandelure... Mega Evolve for justice’s sake...[VAR 0114(0012)]
Defeating you is step one of my plan to put\neveryone to work building a better Lumiose![VAR 0114(0013)]
Our bonds have been built through thick and thin,\nso get ready for the real deal![VAR 0114(0013)]
I’m deeply grateful to you, but all that gets left on\nthe sidelines once we set foot on the battle court.[VAR 0114(0014)]
Skarmory, let’s show them how we were before\nwe met the boss—vicious and unrelenting![VAR 0114(0014)]
When you battle with all your might, you cannot\nhelp but come to admire the opposing Pokémon\r\nand Trainer... Such is the magic of battle![VAR 0114(0015)]
Behold the apex of the SBC’s power! Prepare to\nbe dazzled by our magnificent Mega Evolution![VAR 0114(0015)]
Winning in the Infinite Z-A Royale will be my way\nof memorializing how I’ve changed since we met![VAR 0114(0016)]
Battles are for breaking free of your boundaries!\nDragalge, give me everythin’ you got![VAR 0114(0016)]
Meeting you and your friends has made my inner\nflame blaze bright![VAR 0114(0017)]
We’re going to burn so bright, we’ll be blinding.\nLet’s ignite with Mega Evolution, Charizard![VAR 0114(0017)]
Get ready for a scorching wave of my gratitude![VAR 0114(0018)]
Nouveau is all about building a new life for\nourselves! Let’s Mega Evolve into something new![VAR 0114(0018)]
There’s something I noticed, being the amazing\ncabbie that I am...\c\nPokémon battles are like driving a car—it’s all\nabout keeping control of the situation.[VAR 0114(002F)]
I trained my Pokémon up by a whole level, so my\ntank is nearly empty![VAR 0114(002F)]
Let’s get this over with already.\c\nThat’s what I’d normally think, but no... I’m going\nto take my time and savor this battle![VAR 0114(0030)]

Try looking up from time to time—you might spot\nsomething interesting on the rooftops.
I’m trying to decide which Pokémon to pick as my\nmain partner, but... Argh, I just can’t choose!
You have to scramble up and down ladders to get\nhere, right? There’s no other way?
Yup! We’ve found the absolute perfect place for a\nprivate chat.
We could’ve just stayed at home instead of\ntrekking all the way here, but I guess my folks\r\nwanted to find a cool spot?
That parade five years ago\nmarked the end of an era.
We’ll all be wild Pokémon experts\nnow that there’s so many here.
If I climb this ladder...will\nI see anything interesting?
Even kids like me can beat grown-ups when we’re\nbattling with Pokémon!
That’s right! Kids can go toe-to-toe against adults\nthanks to their Pokémon partners.
[~ 10]
I’d like to know who’s behind this Z-A Royale.\nWhy only at night? What’s its purpose?
I have a sneaking suspicion it’s just that some\nfolks really want to battle in the streets...
That Fist of Justice group is a bit much, don’t you\nthink?
I don’t know about that—I actually get where\nthey’re coming from.\c\nIt’s probably true that people should train up so\nthey can stay safe around wild Pokémon.
What happens to all the Poké Balls that fail to\ncatch wild Pokémon? It’s like they disappear\r\nwhen no one’s watching...
I don’t think much of this “urban redevelopment”\ngoing on in Lumiose.\c\nEven if they manage to create a city where people\nand Pokémon coexist, how is that supposed to\r\nmake my Binacle happy?
Why did they hire a foreign firm like Quasartico to\nhandle the city’s redevelopment anyway?
It’d be great if I could just challenge people to\nbattles instead of saying “hi” or “how you doing?”
But unless you’re on a battle court, your\nPokémon’s moves might hit people nearby!
When you think about it, using moves must come\nas naturally as breathing to Pokémon.\c\nI mean, a move like Yawn is something us\nhumans do too without thinking about it!
I’m glad to see more Pokémon around the city,\nbut our daily routines sure have gotten scarier...
All I need to be happy is a Pokémon to greet me in\nthe morning when I wake up and to be there with\r\nme at night when I go to sleep. That’s all.
Have you heard about Mable’s research tasks?\c\nI’d be interested in helping out, but there’s no\nway I’m setting foot in those wild zones...
No one seems to know why Pokémon have been\nflooding into the city lately.\c\nIt’s not a problem for them to be here...as long as\nthey don’t cause trouble or disturb the peace.
Well, Pokémon are always going to stir things up\na little, aren’t they? We just need to get used to it\r\nif we’re all going to live together.
Here at Café Cyclone, we\ncause quite the stir! [VAR BD0A(000A)]Text_icon1
[~ 27]
How can you tell when a Pokémon is strong?
It’s not just about strength—you also gotta think\nabout type matchups when you’re battling.
I think that a Pokémon’s strength depends a lot\non the orders its Trainer gives.
[~ 31]
We need to learn to move forward\nwithout dwelling on our losses.
Of course Pokémon will attack you\nif you catch them by surprise!
Being on holiday should mean taking it easy, you\nknow? We don’t have to visit EVERY tourist trap.
Yeah, but when are we gonna get the chance to\ncome to Lumiose again? I wanna see the sights!
If we exhaust ourselves running around the city,\nwe won’t have the energy to do anything anyway!
Eating and drinking well is the\nmost important thing in life.
Folks around here sure\ndo have lovely Pokémon.
I always want other people’s\nPokémon for some reason.
Why are wild Pokémon coming to Lumiose?
I’ve been staring at the water so long, I’ve clean\nforgotten which direction I came from.
I’ve been pondering possible explanations for why\nwe’re seeing so many wild Pokémon these days.
Well, Lumiose is a lovely city...but I guess that\nwould be sort of a silly explanation, wouldn’t it.
I can’t help thinking things must be better on the\nother side of the water.
Take it from a wise old woman—when you’re\napproaching wild Pokémon, you should try to\r\nsneak up on them from behind.
There sure are some speedy Pokémon out there.\nBefore you even realize it, they’re all up in your\r\npersonal space, trying to make a snack out of you!
The backrests on these Lumiose benches do\nwonders for my spine.
Oh, this old husband of mine loves to plonk\nhimself down on benches all day long.
Dealing damage quickly is one area you can\nfocus on, sure. But is that an effective strategy?
When I’m battling, I tend to go for moves that you\ncan use in quick succession.
There’ll be a cooldown time after each one of your\nPokémon’s moves, so you need to make sure your\r\nchoice of move is always efficient.
It’s not all that complicated—just choose moves\nthat your opponents are weak to. Those are your\r\nbest bet for dealing hefty amounts of damage.
Could you even hazard a guess at how many cafés\nthere are in Lumiose?
n/a
n/a
I traded Pokémon for the\nfirst time the other day.
Pokémon you receive in trades\nwill grow faster, you know!
I’ve been around the block in my time, and I\nthought I had Pokémon battles figured out, but...\c\nI’ll never forget the time I chose what I thought\nwas a winning move, only for it to have no effect...
Yes, you were really down about that for a while,\nweren’t you, darling?\c\nYour Pokémon didn’t seem to mind at all, though.
Pokémon are so cute!
Pokémon are so cool!
[~ 62]
Do you think the wild Pokémon living in Lumiose\nwill start to become more, er...civilized?
Wild Pokémon appear\noutside wild zones too!
Welcome to Lumiose, the city that’s on just about\neveryone’s travel bucket list!
Huh...\c\nThis is all really interesting, but could we go sit\ndown at a café somewhere? I’m beat...
Even if Lumiose keeps changing, I bet it’ll always\nfeel like Lumiose in some way or another!
Hmm... I wonder if Pokémon ever fight over\nterritory?
Pokémon have their own happy places, just like\npeople! My happy place is in the shade.
I’ve seen some outrageously big Pokémon in this\ncity. Is it all the gourmet food they’re eating?
When I’m attacked by Pokémon, I\ndodge like my life depends on it!
Taxi drivers sometimes\nhave the wildest stories.
Living in the big city side-by-side with Pokémon,\nhuh? I wonder about that...
My Pokémon and I make quite\na striking combination, don’t we?
Do you think wild Pokémon\nenjoy living here in Lumiose?
Five years since that whole mess...\nOoh, that lousy Team Flare...
Press [VAR BD0A(0006)]Cancel to dash!
I’ve been cleaning up the, um,\ndroppings of wild Pokémon.
Do wild Pokémon get along\nwith Pokémon from the city?
I’m out looking for my new\nfavorite spot in Lumiose.
Meowstic is best known for its psychic power!
There’s nothing like enjoying a meal outside on a\nnice, unhurried day.
Bonjour! How about something light to eat?
I love this plaza. Amid all the bustle of the city, it’s\nblessedly peaceful and quiet.
Hey, all you Pokémon in the grass! Come out,\nalready—I know you’re in there!
Shhh! I’m hiding!
We’re playing hide-and-seek! Now, where did\neveryone go...?
I always get really excited when we’re playing\nhide-and-seek.
You never know what you might find at the other\nend of a ladder.
A surprising number of Pokémon are nocturnal.
I just can’t see a rooftop without wanting to climb\nup and see what I might find!
How can a flimsy hologram keep Pokémon fenced\nin? I can’t wrap my head around it...
Lumiose is like a whole different city at night.
If you lose your way in the side streets, it’s best to\nhead back to a major road to get your bearings.\c\nNot that I have any idea which direction that’d be\nfrom here...
I’m training hard so I don’t lose when my\nPokémon and I play tag... It’s not going well.
Do you think the rumors about the art thieves are\ntrue? If so, they’re smooth criminals, all right.
Surely there’re people out there who use their\nPokémon’s powers for their own evil purposes.
I keep my Pokémon inside their balls whenever\nwe travel by car.
I, er... I have a pretty serious fear of heights.\c\nI try to stay back from the edge, but it’s my job to\nwork on the scaffolding...and it’s just so scary!

Who’s gonna grow up faster—my Pokémon\nor me?
Prism Tower sits right in the middle of the city,\nalmost as if it’s watching over us all.
If you want to get by in Lumiose, you have to\nknow how to get along with Pokémon.
I think it’s great to have Pokémon in the city.
I wonder... How do the Pokémon feel about living\nwith humans here in the city?
A city where people and Pokémon coexist sounds\nnice and all, but Pokémon must also be nervous\r\nabout getting too close to humans, right?
When two people lock eyes...is that the signal for\na Pokémon battle to start?
Because of that old custom for starting Pokémon\nbattles, now I get nervous every time I make eye\r\ncontact with someone.
Pokémon are dropping so many items these days!\nOf course, I can just pick ’em up and sell them.
My partner Pokémon and I are hard at work\npatrolling the streets again today.
Skwee!\c\nSKWEEEEEE!\c\nHehe. We’re practicing our Pokémon cries! I was\na Scatterbug just now.
SKWEEEEEE!
Hop in a Lumi Cab, and you can get anywhere in\nLumiose in a flash!
This area near the station is nice and busy. You\ncan really feel the glamour of Lumiose.
n/a
Make a decision soon, OK? You can’t hem and\nhaw over this forever.
I know that!\c\nIt’s just so hard to choose between evolving my\ndarling Pokémon to make it stronger, or having\r\nit stay small and cute forever...
Prism Tower really sticks out, doesn’t it? You step\noff the train into Lumiose and BLAM! There it is.
I don’t wanna spend all my pocket money on\nPoké Balls...but I wanna be able to catch new\r\nPokémon friends whenever they pop up!
The best part about buying stuff is choosing!\c\nOnce you’ve actually bought something, you\nknow exactly what you’re getting. That’s no fun.
I always get the latest news from the magazines\nat kiosks.
You can meet new Pokémon around every corner\nin this city. What a time and place to be alive!
The first step of any successful shopping trip is to\nfind a store that tickles your fancy.
Oh geez, I need to get moving. The client meeting\ncan’t start without me!\c\nMaybe I should hop in a Lumi Cab to make sure I\nget there on time...
My kids will be setting off on their own little\nadventures outside the city soon, so I’m on the\r\nhunt for some sneakers to give them.
If you need to heal up your Pokémon, the\nPokémon Center’s the place to go!
We’re trimming the bushes! Don’t worry—I’m\nmaking sure my Pokémon’s using moves safely.
My Goomy is so adorably goopy.
I’d love to soar up into the sky like a bird Pokémon\nand look down on Lumiose from above!
Me? I love plans. Love making ’em, love following\n’em. Her, though? She likes to go with the flow.
I think the fact that we’re complete opposites\nmakes our relationship exciting!
Whether this is your first time visiting or you’re\ncoming home, welcome to Lumiose City!
Guhhh... H-hold up... Haah... I need...a break!
I can’t believe you’ve lost your breath already!\nThat’s it—we’re doing 50 laps round the city next!
This city’s so big, and there’s so many places we\nwant to go! All this wandering has gotten us lost.
Even if I get lost, it’s no big deal. Nothing bad’s\ngoing to happen as long as I have my Pokémon!
I’m on a research trip\nwith my Pokémon.
Some Pokémon and people\nprefer the shade, you know...
Catering to Pokémon as customers\ncould be a business opportunity...
I’m looking into how my sales\nare affected by the weather! [VAR BD0A(000A)]Text_icon1
All this scaffolding popping up...\nYou could call it modern art!
I came back home to Lumiose,\nbut... Wow, this city’s changed.
I wanna join the secret\nbattle tournament too!
Maybe study up on your\npartner Pokémon first?
I always let my Pokémon\npick my travel destinations.
[~ 146]
I wish there was a marathon you could run with\nyour Pokémon.
The benches in this city aren’t safe! They’re so\ncomfy to sit on, you fall asleep right away.
Is it better to team up with other\nTrainers in the Z-A Royale?
It sure is easier to battle when\nsomeone else can heal you up.
Yeah, you’re an easy target on\nthe way to the Pokémon Center!
If only I could capture the daytime and nighttime\nvisages of Lumiose in the very same painting...\r\nIt would really deepen my artistic vision!
When you’re in the middle of a staircase, you can\ngo up OR down! The possibilities are endless!\c\nI’m already late for tutoring, though, so I should\nprobably choose one and get going...
Apparently it was Quasartico who invented the\nholo-tech that fences off the wild zones.
Hotel Z has good reviews, but I’d be terrified with\nthat nine-foot-tall man looming over me...
Roughly how tall is Prism Tower, do you think?
n/a
Oof, I need to clean my place when I get back...\c\nI don’t mind a bit of mess, but my Pokémon gets\nsuper grumpy at me if I leave it.
If Pokémon are knocked out a lot in battle...they\ngrow resentful of their Trainers, you know...
You got any tips for sneaking out late at night?
We’re forming a team so we can win the\nZ-A Royale!
Problem is, we can’t leave our houses at night\nsince our parents’ Pokémon keep an eye on us...
Our Pokémon are strong and everything!
For our next project, how about we film you\nbattling against that game streamer, Canari?
Nooo, no no. There’s no way I can beat Canari in a\nbattle!
When you let your partner Pokémon out of its\nball, wild Pokémon will start attacking it.
There are too many darn Pokémon all over the\nplace! How am I supposed to enjoy a nice walk?
The Fist of Justice...? I mean, I really don’t know\nabout that Ivor guy...
If strength is what you’re after, the Fist of Justice\nis the best group to join!
[~ 170]
First, you attack a wild Pokémon, then you catch it\nwhile it’s stunned!
Some folks go around picking up\nPoké Balls people have thrown!
I get this weird feeling when I look\nat Magikarp. What could it be?
They grow food for wild Pokémon\nin fields outside the city.
Did you know there are bad people trying to bring\nmore wild Pokémon into the city?
I heard we shouldn’t use our Rotom Phones\nbefore bed. It’s better to just go to sleep!
We should learn all we can about our Pokémon\npartners so we can live and work together better.
We study Pokémon at school, too!
It’s fun learning all about Pokémon, but I wish we\ngot less homework...
[~ 180]
Lots of Trainers are Mega Evolving their Pokémon\nthese days, huh?
Oh, that’s ’cause Trainers who make it to the\nupper ranks of the Z-A Royale get Mega Rings.
You know, the Stone Emporium won’t sell you\nMega Stones unless you have a Mega Ring.
I’d love to paint Pokémon as they’re battling, but I\nreally don’t want to take a hit from their attacks...
When wild Pokémon do “bad” things, they’re\noften just trying to survive.
Weird things keep popping up ever\nsince more Pokémon came here...
Now why in the world are there\nMega Crystals on the rooftops?
Lumiose has completely changed\nsince that shocker a few years ago.
I’m not sure I could tell my partner\napart from others of its species.
Wild Pokémon tend to attack your partner\nPokémon before they come for you.
You’ll come across wild Pokémon in back alleys\nsometimes. Don’t get too close or they’ll getcha!
With Pokémon all over the city, it’s a golden\nopportunity for big business to make big bucks!
I heard that the sector numbers go up the farther\nyou get from Centrico Plaza.
How delightful it would be to be the best Pokémon\nTrainer in the city.
Do you think there’ll be more and more Pokémon\nin Lumiose, and they’ll take over the city one day?
Gosh, I had no idea that alpha Pokémon could be\nfound in Lumiose, too!
Here’s a factoid for ya—individuals of the same\nPokémon species come in lots of different sizes.\c\nMe? I love collecting Pokémon in all the myriad\nsizes they come in!
Mega Crystals really get in the way of our work.
Ambush tactics seem to\nwork well in the Z-A Royale.
n/a
[~ 201]
I wanna eat Galarian food! Mushroom Medley\nCurry is the best!
A balanced diet is important, of course, but it’s\nalso good to prioritize eating things we like.
When Trainers are nervous, their Pokémon get\nnervous too.
AZ isn’t so strange compared to\nsome of the Pokémon out there.
Wild Pokémon are quick to notice when you send\nout your partner Pokémon.
It’d be cool to make it all the way to the other\nside, but then what would I do over there?
You can think about that once you’re there!
Rainbows are pretty, but they sure disappear fast.\nIt’s no good chasing after ’em...
Is it really for the best that we now have all these\nPokémon in Lumiose?
Oh, I’m sure lots of folks are happy about it...and\njust as many folks will leave the city, afraid of\r\nsuch close contact with Pokémon.
[~ 212]
How unusual! Pokémon don’t\ntend to care about people’s stuff.
Welp. You see something\nnew every day in Lumiose.
When a Pokémon holds a Quick Claw in battle,\nit’ll sometimes use its moves faster than usual.
I loved the old Gogoat Shuttle service. But as\nmore Pokémon kept coming to the city, the\r\nGogoat got more and more skittish, you see...
Just because lots of people left the city after that\nincident five years ago doesn’t mean we should\r\nbe filling the place with wild Pokémon instead...
Hotel Z is nice enough, but I’d much rather stay at\nHotel Richissime.
How many of those rumors about the owner of\nHotel Z are true, I wonder?
If you’re looking for Hotel Z, it’s straight down\nthis alley here.
If you’re looking for Hotel Z... [VAR BD0A(000A)]Text_icon1
If your Pokémon get injured, bring them to the\nPokémon Center right away to get healed!\c\nI mean, that’s the least we should be doing after\nthey battle so bravely for us, right?
I give my Pokémon water from the water cooler\nhere when they get thirsty.
[~ 224]
It feels like Lumiose has shifted from being a city\nof tourists to being a city of Pokémon.
I don’t think our lives will change all that much\nwith a few more Pokémon in the mix, though.
It’s an extraordinary thing to be surrounded by\nPokémon from the day you’re born.
I dunno about you, but I don’t think there’s any\nsuch thing as a surefire strategy or a “correct” way\r\nto compete in Pokémon battles.
The fact that they called it Wild Zone 1 implies\nthat they knew there’d be more to come.
No guidebook gives\ntips as good as that!
The best days are\nspent idly chatting.
People must be luring all these Pokémon into the\ncity! Some die-hard Pokémon lovers, I’ll bet!
You should try having your Pokémon hold a Berry\nof some sort. Sitrus Berries are good!
I’m still in shock that these wild zones exist.
I’m having to take lots of detours thanks to all\nthese wild zones...\c\nBut I guess that’s helped me find places around\nLumiose that I never would’ve seen otherwise.
Those who strike first win!
The Pokémon in wild zones seem to notice right\naway when I send out my partner Pokémon.
Moves get more powerful when they’re the same\ntype as the Pokémon that uses ’em!
Pokémon can only remember four moves at once.\nIf they want to learn a new move, they have to\r\nforget one of their current ones first!
More wild Pokémon means more wild zones.
Battling is what makes Pokémon, well, Pokémon.\c\nOf course, keeping them around as companions\nto love and coddle is also fine.
Pokémon don’t have to battle—it’s perfectly fine\nfor them to simply exist as their adorable selves.\c\nNot that I don’t understand why others might\nwish to have their Pokémon do battle, of course.
I’m headed to Boutique Couture to find an outfit\nthat’s simply and stunningly ME.
When you exceed expectations at work, lo and\nbehold, more work gets piled on your plate...\c\nOn balance, it’s hard to tell if that’s a good or a\nbad thing.
The city is changing, and with\nit the scenery I so adored.
Walking down alleyways these days has me\nfeeling like some kind of intrepid explorer!
Wanna know how I dash real fast? I just press [VAR BD0A(0006)]Cancel!
[~ 248]
Well, it’s safe to say we should all make a habit of\ncarrying plenty of Poké Balls around.
I heard there are people out there who pick up all\nthe Poké Balls that missed their targets.
I always make sure to focus on a Pokémon and\naim carefully. I don’t want to waste my Poké Balls!
I’d love to do street performances\nwith Pokémon. I’ll be a jongleur!
[~ 253]
Use [VAR BD0A(0002)]ZL to aim well, then let those Poké Balls fly!
Sometimes being with others\nmakes you feel more alone.
I hear tangible holo-tech\nwas a Quasartico invention.
The billboards all over Lumiose\nhave been around for a century!
Some collectors can’t get\nenough of Tiny Mushrooms.
[~ 259]
We’ve got so many benches in Lumiose. I’d like to\nsit on them all...ebenchually!\c\nEvery bench has its own particular character.\nThere’s one halfway across the city that really\r\nstruck me. It’s in a secluded court shaded by\r\ntrees, with interesting people coming and going...
It takes a certain kind of talent to be able to\nblather on and on about utterly boring topics...
The best part about this\ntruck is the lovely waitress.
The Nouveau Café food truck is\nthe highlight of Centrico Plaza.
Is it the coffee that brings me\nhere every day, or the staff...?
I end up ordering the\nsame thing every time...
If there’s one thing Lumiose is\nknown for, it’s the croissants!
Nouveau Café’s croissants\nare simply sublime.
Step right up and order! [VAR BD0A(000A)]Text_icon1
We pride ourselves on\nbeing expert roasters! [VAR BD0A(000A)]Text_icon1
Try the coffee that Lumiose\nlocals can’t get enough of! [VAR BD0A(000A)]Text_icon1
You can’t go up the tower, but\nyou can enjoy a coffee instead! [VAR BD0A(000A)]Text_icon1
We’ll have to close up shop if\nwe don’t get more customers! [VAR BD0A(000A)]Text_icon1
Drink our coffee! [VAR BD0A(000A)]Text_icon1
Even if you’re stuffed, there’s\nalways room for coffee! [VAR BD0A(000A)]Text_icon1
[~ 275]
What’s all the\nhubbub about?
It looked like that Pokémon was\ncarrying a bag, of all things...
Lumiose is like a maze,\nisn’t it? I just love it!
Quasartico has been put in charge of the city’s\nredevelopment plan. It’s an admirable mission.
A city shared by humans and Pokémon...\c\nI wonder if bringing everyone even closer together\nwill really make everyone happy?
I was the one who caught this Numel, but it gets\nalong much better with my daughter...
I give my Numel lots of cuddles!
I’m the best in my family at battling with Numel.
I’d love to race a Pokémon from\nthe station to Prism Tower.
People and Pokémon sure\nlive by different rules, huh?
Do you think there are Pokémon on top of trees as\nwell?
Trash goes in the trash can, got it? And pick up\nany litter you find on the street, too.
I’ve been asking around for advice about battle\nstrategies.
Yeah, strategy is important, but I’d personally\nadvise you to start by learning type matchups.
I’m really good at picking what to put inside my\nsandwiches!
Our darling daughter always shares her\nsandwiches with her Pokémon.
I’m from Paldea, so naturally I’m a sandwich pro.
Yeah, ’cause being around Pokémon makes you\nfeel all warm inside!
When I’m sad or even just bored, all I need to do\nis bring out my Pokémon.
Life is like a flowing river, don’t you think? It’s\njust something that popped into my head.
With so many Pokémon in the city,\nwe’ll all be pro Trainers in no time.
So I received a Pokémon in a trade, but then it\ngot super strong and stopped listening to me...
Oh, you can fix that by going up the ranks in the\nZ-A Royale.
Our moms’ll get mad at us if we go ahead without\nthem. Why are adults so bossy?
Guuuh... Why do our moms always have to chat\nfor sooooooooo long?
[~ 301]
Going over the rooftops is quicker\nthan taking the streets sometimes.
Maybe I’ll grab a bite to eat\nat Restaurant Le Nah.
It’s easy to meet new people in\na city with so many tourists.
I’mma sell all my Tiny Mushrooms\nand earn heaps of pocket money!
Go buy 10 Poké Balls for me, wouldja?
No way! You just want the Premier Ball anyway!
In the city, we’re all together but\nalone. Nobody knows each other.
More Pokémon means\neveryone’s more happy!
Lumiose Galettes are easier\nto get hold of these days.
I think it’s great that more people\ncan enjoy such a tasty treat.
The contest for the best café in\nLumiose will come down to skill.
You got business with Racine Construction?
There are all kinds of folks in DYN4MO. A lot of\n’em just like watching the streams, nothing more.
I wonder when the next Canari Quiz Whiz Contest\nwill be...
I get so happy when Canari responds to one of\nmy comments.
Apparently Prism Tower came first and Lumiose\nexpanded outward from there.
I’m a fan of Canari’s as well...\c\nBut I can’t limit my fashion choices by dressing\nlike some of her superfans do.
I always dodge Pokémon attacks with beautifully\nexecuted rolls!
More wild zones means more detours...
Jogging around Lumiose is a great way to see the\nsights!
You can find Pokémon down in the sewers that\ndon’t live anywhere else.
Pokémon must find it weird walking on asphalt.
Taxi drivers are always exchanging information—\nthat’s why they know so much about Lumiose.
You see fewer folks on roller skates these days.\c\nI suppose no one wants to crash into a Pokémon\nand go flying...
It used to be that if you didn’t have enough\nmoney for your taxi fare, drivers became so angry\r\nthat they’d challenge you to battle.
I put together this scaffolding course just like\nTarragon asked.\c\nJust one last thing to add, then it’ll be ready!
Hello... Pokémon are\ngreat, aren’t they?

You get way fewer customers when they have to\ngo through a wild zone to get to your stall...
I heard that the guy in charge of the Pokémon\nResearch Lab went to some region really far away.
Would you care\nfor a sample?
We’re giving away one Lumiose Galette on the\nhouse for new customers.
Ahem. Just one sample per customer, please.
Sure wish I could use\nRock Smash! [VAR BD0A(000A)]Text_icon1
If you’re headed into the wild zone there, you’d\nbest remember Potions and such for your team.
Welcome to Lumiose—a city for both people and\nPokémon!
I hope you find plenty of Pokémon—and plenty of\ncafés—that you love here in the city!
For me, there’s nothing better than relaxing in a\ncafé with my Pokémon.
I like to enjoy coffee with my Pidgey. It’s a great\nway to become friendly with your Pokémon.
Even from a purely artistic point of view,\nPokémon are masterpieces.
Where do the wild Pokémon in Lumiose go to\nsleep?
It’s not like everyone wants to live together with\nPokémon. Some people just aren’t fond of them.
I’m afraid we can’t seat you at the moment!
n/a
Wild Pokémon won’t be stealing\nletters from me today, nuh-uh!
The power of science is amazing!\nHolo-tech keeps wild zones safe!
I’m studying Pokémon\nso I can be a professor!
I keep hearing that the redevelopment plan was\nadopted because the mayor forced it through.\r\nIf that’s true, isn’t it outrageous?
If Lumiose can become a city where people and\nPokémon live side-by-side, it’ll be such a unique\r\nplace to live!
This city has lots of old buildings.\nWe try to keep them renovated.

I’ll fix anything a Pokémon\ndamages in no time!
If you want to get to know someone, just ask\nthem what their favorite Pokémon is.
Wouldn’t it be awesome if there was a school\nwhere we only learned about Pokémon stuff?
I guess so...but wouldn’t it be even worse if you\nended up failing?
Geez, way to kill the vibe. ’Sides, maybe there’s\nsomething we could learn by losing.
Fire-type moves get weaker if it’s raining!
And Water-type moves become stronger in the\nrain... It might be worth keeping in mind.
Here I am, completely taken by the\nrecipes I was trying to steal...
I might seem fancy, but wait\nuntil you get to know me...
Pokémon are such powerful creatures, and yet for\nsome reason they listen to us in battle...
Pokémon moves are fun just\nto watch, don’t you think?
There are more and more wild zones... I wonder if\nthere’s some sort of pattern to them?
Look, I’m sorry, I really am! But I swear I told you\nthis already...
Hey, Prism Tower’s under construction! You\nshould at least do research before planning trips!
Youths have potential, old folks\nhave experience. Both are good!
[~ 15]
Could we get away with charging\n100,000 for a cup of coffee? [VAR BD0A(000A)]Text_icon1
I should help out with Mable’s research to get\nsome of those TMs she hands out.
Come ooonnn, let’s trade Pokémon! I’ll even send\nover my Weedle!
I’m happy to trade, but I dunno if giving away my\nAmpharos for a Weedle is fair...
Don’t be afraid to use a Potion\non your Pokémon during battle.
Now, which stand was it\nthat stocks those Berries...?
Trying to choose which Berry to\ngive my Pokémon unnerves me...
I don’t need to be a hero as long\nas I can help the folks in this city.
Police officers should be able to\nhave cute partners too, right?
I wonder what happens to Pokémon that are used\nby bad Trainers to do bad things?
I’d say it’s the Trainers who should get punished\nif they make their Pokémon do bad things.
I found a lost Pokémon,\nso I came to drop it off.
Policing, huh... You know, that might be the job\nfor me if I want to show off my skills as a Trainer.
Running empties your mind. It\nbrings you closer to nothingness.
I help deliver information\nabout the city!
Isn’t it a blast battling with all\nsorts of different Pokémon?
We’ll need to battle effectively no matter what\nkind of Pokémon are on our teams.\c\nOur undercover mission depends on it!
I don’t think anyone would look at\nme and guess I’m a cop.
Cafés are great for gathering info.\nI’ll be the perfect waitress!
It’s nice to see so many Pokémon roaming about,\nbut I worry we people might run out of space...
It’s tough being a cop in a city where we all live\nwith Pokémon. Rookies need to work hard.
All roads lead to Prism Tower.
What makes a Pokémon strong? Working\ntogether with its Trainer, maybe?
Bringing out your Pokémon’s full potential is a\nvital skill for a Trainer, that’s for sure.
It’s best to overdo\nthings just a little bit!
My Pikachu’s been having tummy\ntroubles recently. I’m worried...
I have my Pokémon use moves to wake me up.\nSometimes I almost end up in an eternal sleep...
Wouldn’t you like to\nvisit Shutterbug Café?
Sure, but I won’t shut up about\nphotography. You know that, right?
I accidentally come off as rude\nwhen I speak a foreign language...
If you’re in a foreign region and around people\nyou don’t know, just have a Pokémon battle.\r\nYou’ll make friends in no time.
I hear they’re cutting prices to\nkeep people from leaving the city.
I’ve got my Pokémon with me now,\nbut my parents’ll come pick me up.
“Adventure”... That word\nhas such a nice ring to it.
[~ 50]
I wanna do something big!
How about we go look for\nLegendary Pokémon?
We don’t even know\nwhere we’d find any!
Well, that’s why we need to look!\nYou gotta dream big, y’know!
I don’t know the name of the tune\nthey play around town, but I like it!
What’d happen if the wild zones broke down? It’s\ntoo terrifying to even imagine!
One minute late, one day late...\nSame difference, am I right?
Why is it we can only carry six\nPokémon with us at a time?!
Defeat me, and I’ll grant your wish. But I won’t go\neasy on you just because you’re my child!
I know your Pokémon, and that means I can plan\na way to counter them, Dad!
It’s not a bad idea to train up your Pokémon,\nwhether there are wild zones around or not.
Thanks for always helping me train my Pokémon.
Rolling lets you evade moves, but it’s slower than\ndashing!
It wasn’t that long ago we had to use PCs to\naccess the Boxes where we kept our Pokémon!
Some Pokémon need to be in\nbattle to really shine!
I want to eat my fill of food that\ngives me lots of energy!
For dinner, I’d like to go out...\nbut for this battle, I’m going all in!
Win or lose, our Pokémon\nshould still get a feast!
I won’t bet my dinner on a\nbattle, but I’ll bet my honor!
I’m more interested in the commentary than the\nbattle itself. I’m here for the play-by-play!
Well, they seem to be battling over what to have\nfor dinner. At the end of the day, though, I’d say\r\nthe mother will have the final word...
My Pokémon are too cute. I spend\nthe whole day just admiring them.
Now where did I put\nmy roller skates...?
Who’s more important—your\nloved ones or your Pokémon?
You can’t just ask\npeople that kind of thing!
It’s not that I want to win.\nI just don’t want to lose.
We’re going to take on wild zones as a family!
We’re gonna catch strong Pokémon and then\nclimb the ranks of the Z-A Royale!
Once we get to Rank A, we’re gonna go on a trip\naround the world!
I hope my friend back\nhome is doing OK...
There’ve been more Pokémon-related incidents\nlately. But that’s the cost of coexisting.
My Rotom Phone is\nalways in sleep mode.
There are actually more nocturnal\nPokémon than you’d imagine.
A lot of collectors are all about Shiny Pokémon.
Ahhh, Aromatisse...\nSuch an alluring name.
I haven’t had the Perilous Soup\nfrom the Juice Shoppe in a while...
Poké Balls let you catch Pokémon. And they’re so\ncheap!
Personally, I prefer the design of Ultra Balls.
I finish task after task, and yet\nthere’s always more work...
Lumiose Press is closing too, eh? The industry’s\ntruly in a slump.
They’re not closing, dear. The editors are just\nworking at a café around here.
[~ 92]
Five years ago, I was what\nyou’d call a punk guy.
Every time I turn a corner, I like to imagine I might\nbump into my favorite person or a Pokémon I like.
Promotion matches can happen\nat any hour of the day, I hear.
A battle in the heart of the city!\nWhat a spectacle that was!
Is there anything more worthwhile\nthan encounters with Pokémon?
I won’t get poisoned if I brush up against a\nPoison-type Pokémon, will I?
So I can only have six Pokémon\nwith me at a time, huh?
It’d be really confusing trying to\ngive orders to a whole crowd.
A Trainer needs to cherish each\nand every member of their team.
Boy, I’m beat. Today’s been as long\nas a day without bread, you know?
If they keep setting up more wild zones, this will\neventually be the Pokémon’s city—not ours.
It doesn’t matter if you mess up during practice.\nIt’s all to make sure you don’t mess up in battle!
Gosh, I’m bored... I guess it\nbeats being too busy, though. [VAR BD0A(000A)]Text_icon1
It’s so weak and yet it survives...\nMagikarp is cool like that.
Life finds a way.
I don’t want to lose to any kid!\nThere’s no deep reason why!
When you see a large Pokémon stretching, it’s\nimpossible not to say, “That’s a big stretch!”
“Hard to stay in love”?\nPlease, I make it easy.
It’s easy to fall in love,\nbut hard to stay in love.
I wanna use\nFire types!
Think I’ll go with\nWater types.
Then I’ll pick\nGrass types!
I’ll be Electric!
I wonder if Pokémon ever show up in front of\npeople because they want to be caught?
You never know! Maybe your Swirlix was thinking\njust that sort of thing when it showed up.
Poké Puffs sure\nare delicious, huh?
With Pokémon around, I’m\ntwice as happy and half as sad!
Though battling with just one\nPokémon can be tough...
Let’s head home\nright at quitting time.
Mais oui! Overworking ourselves\nsimply lets others relax more!
I really want to become Rank A in the Z-A Royale.\nMaybe I should just move here to Lumiose...
I used to be just a tourist, but then I found I really\nenjoy traveling. Now I’m a full-time backpacker!
Lumiose isn’t perfect, but it’s still a great city. It’s\nmy job to make sure it stays that way.
I’m going to live my life without\nbeing afraid of being happy!
Maybe a nice, cute Spinarak\ncould help draw in customers...
When you love someone, at first you can forgive\na lot. But then the things you can’t forgive start\r\nadding up, precisely because you care so much.
The Kalos region is famous for its circuses!\nLately, the cirque contemporain style is very in.\r\nThe performances are amazing!
During Z-A Royale matches, weak Trainers tend to\nstay near Pokémon Centers.
People, Pokémon... We’re all going to die\nsomeday, aren’t we?
That’s really sad...
Just because everyone’s doing\nsomething doesn’t make it right.
Pokémon help me stay happy\neach and every day! [VAR BD0A(000A)]Text_icon1
That furisode looks gorgeous, but it must be a\npain to take care of...
I take it to a specialist cleaner. I hear they rely on\nPokémon to help with the work.
Pokémon battles after work are the one thing I\ntruly enjoy.\c\nWait...that’s not true! I also enjoy my dear\nPokémon’s company!
Cheese sandwiched in a fresh baguette! I’ve got\nno complaints in life as long as I’ve got this!
Here’s your lunch! Try not to forget it at home\nnext time!
I’m a member of the Pokédex Research Society. If\nI were to write Sliggoo’s entry, I’d say...\c\n“This Pokémon covers itself in a membrane that\ndissolves anything. Sliggoo will even try to\r\ndissolve those it becomes friendly with.”
My partner Pokémon is with me everywhere I go,\nbut nowhere we go is actually home to us...
Want to try swapping\nplaces with me?
No way! What if Lady\nJacinthe caught me?!
A human can’t defeat a Pokémon,\nno matter how much they train.
I’m surveying the area to see if we can place a\nHolovator around here.
I heard about a tunnel with lotsa\ndangerous Pokémon deep inside.
I hear people who go in\nnever come back out...
You two should go explore!
I’ll follow my savior’s example\nand help the less fortunate.
[~ 150]
Back when I was a kid, I got into trouble trying to\ngo into tall grass without a Pokémon.
Even as an adult I’ve been told to be careful\nwhenever I enter a wild zone.
Who is La Primera...? I heard she can bring out\nthe full potential of any Pokémon...
I say what I mean. No\none can read minds.
If words elude you, there’s\nalways Pokémon battling!
It tickles the imagination when you overhear\nconversations walking around town, right?
I know what you mean. I sometimes try and\nguess what kind of Pokémon they have.
I end up eavesdropping. It’s like I get a sneak\npeek into a world I don’t know!
I came down using the ladder, but...it seems like\nI’ve hit a dead end.
Hmm... This might be a good spot for training—if\nmy Pokémon likes it, that is.
The city keeps changing over time. I just hope my\nfavorite views stay the same.
Everyone changes their thinking\nafter they’ve had a good meal.
You always flip-flop on\nyour opinions, don’t you?
[~ 164]
Oh, don’t worry. This is my first time instructing\nsomeone too!
This is my first Pokémon battle. I’m counting on\nyou to give me good instructions!
I wonder if it’s safe to drink Clauncher’s Water\nGun?
Once I sit down on a bench, I can\nhardly make myself get up!
Time passes extra fast\nwhen you’re on a bench.
I wonder what the deal\nwas with Team Flare?
I want a Pokémon that’s strong and also looks\nreally cool.
I hear the police are even busier these days\nthanks to the increase in wild Pokémon.
I make deliveries during my break.\nThat’s just how I like to work.
I may not look it, but I’m Rank Q.\nI’m in a bit of a slump, though...
Do you think Pokémon like sitting on benches?
I’m really curious about this\none regular’s Clauncher...
You can’t idolize something\nyou know nothing about.
I’m so tired during the day...\nAll ’cause of the Z-A Royale...
If I’m by myself, I ride Pokémon.\nBut a car’s the best for a crowd.
The order of the Pokémon on your team is pretty\nimportant, you know?
Even your strongest Pokémon can’t keep winning\nforever, after all.
Do you send out your ace at the beginning? Or do\nyou keep it as a finisher?
Some battles boil down to which Pokémon you\nsend out.
I want to have my Pokémon sing\nand for everyone to listen.
I feel like I could do anything with\nthe power of my Pokémon.
I’m going to add the first Pokémon\nI meet today to my team.
Who has time to be bored when you’re people\nwatching and Pokémon watching?
People will do some crazy things when they get\nhungry. So do Pokémon, actually.
Good coffee doesn’t need a\nsign to advertise itself.
[~ 190]
Mega Shards! We need to get as many Mega\nShards as we can, y’hear?
On the wrong side of the law? Just make sure you\nstay on the right side of Pokémon!
“Eyes! Aim for the eyes!” Those\nwere my brother’s last words...
If ya haven’t noticed, I’m a member of the Rust\nSyndicate. Why d’you keep buggin’ me like this?
I like how you battle with your Pokémon! I could\ntell you really care for them.
Nobody wants to start trouble\nso long as ya look tough.
It’s not like we do anythin’.\nWe just stand around.
I feel bad for Pokémon\nthat have evil Trainers...
I get a bit nervous anytime\nI see a cop strollin’ around...
You need to think carefully about which four\nmoves you’ll teach your Pokémon.
Gotta earn money so I can\nfeed my lovely Pokémon!
Some people get real arrogant just\n’cause they have strong Pokémon.
Then I’m already stronger than the Champion!
In order to become a strong Trainer, the first step\nis to really love your Pokémon.
There are a lot of different types of collectors.\nSome see it as a duty, some just like to compete...
The acting director of the research\nlab... I swear I’ve seen her before.
I’m gonna help with Mable’s\nresearch and get a TM.
Taking walks with my Pokémon\nhelps me feel energized.
Funny how our company’s woes\ngo away if the bottom line goes up.
No human could withstand\nWeedle’s Poison Sting.
I want to set up a trapeze\nbetween these buildings.
Practice helps build familiarity. Familiarity helps\nyou stay calm.
Pokémon raised by people are stronger than wild\nPokémon. I wonder if that means Pokémon use\r\npeople to become stronger?
I can’t go anywhere without\nmy Pokémon these days.
Pokémon are the ones running\nthe show at work. At home, too...
Watch us grunts wash away the rust! ♪
We clean the city of dirt and dust! ♪
Have you got business with the Rust Syndicate?\nIf not, buzz off!
Hey! Keep up the good work for Lumiose!
[~ 220]
I don’t say anything about\nmyself unless I’m asked.
Living with Pokémon does make\nme a little conscious of their smell.
There’s a local Ace Trainer who helps me out.
How do you learn about Pokémon? Me, I look up\nstuff online.
Sometimes the most precious\nmoments are during wasted time.
I wish my Pokémon could deliver\nthis, but then I’d be out of a job.
Even an ordinary meal is\nspecial if it’s in Lumiose.
I don’t have time for Pokémon battles. I’m too\nbusy with tennis!
I go to judo classes with my Pokémon. We\npractice together.
It’s better to throw everything\naway than let junk tie you down!
I can’t remember... What was my\ndream when I was younger...?
[~ 232]
Why is it my moves always seem to miss at the\nmost crucial moment?
As the Trainer, you’ve got the power to pick moves\nwith a lower chance of missing.
Some high-powered moves end up missing the\nopponent a lot of the time...\c\nIt’s hard to know when to use moves like that and\nwhen to play it safe!
My Pokémon\nran away...
Things were so bad between you\na Poké Ball wouldn’t help, huh?
I wanna use Pokémon moves! I wanna use\nFlamethrower!
A city where nobody knows me...\nChoosing to be alone is freeing.
Is it too much to ask for a spot\nof my own in this big city?!
My partner Gengar keeps looking at me like I’m\nits prey...
C’mon... You’ve gotta tell me... How in the world\ndo you get a Gengar?!\c\nIt can’t be... It’s inconceivable!\c\nYou must have a friend who will trade Pokémon\nwith you!
I don’t know how you all can tell which Pokémon\nis in which Poké Ball.
Is the Pokémon Rotom really inside my Rotom\nPhone?!
I caught my partner when it\nwandered into my home!
If I ever get lost, I know I can\njust aim for Prism Tower.
My greatest foe in the Z-A Royale\nis my lack of sleep... So drowsy...
Doing the right thing doesn’t always mean you’ll\nget the right results. Why? Because life is unfair.
Let’s battle before I paint!\nA win will surely inspire me!
All it takes to go on a journey is a pinch of\ncuriosity! Really, that’s it!
This is just everyday wear for me, but I guess it’s\npretty unusual to people from far away.
Can I take your picture?
The latest fashion of Lumiose!
People and Pokémon all have\ntheir strengths and weaknesses.
Night patrols are frightening, even for an officer.\nPokémon cries and other noises all around...
If only my dear Gogoat could\ncarry me and my packages...
Torn between a fit you love and\none that suits you? Both are good!
I tried to throw a Poké Ball,\nonly to hurt my shoulder...
Pokémon battle skills are part of what you need to\nsucceed in corporate life!
Pokémon don’t need to be strong. All they need to\ndo is keep me company when life’s hard...
I plan on booking an entire\nbeauty salon for my Pokémon.
Moves that miss a lot\nare unreliable in a pinch.
I just ate, and yet here I am\nthinking about my next meal...
I’m really good at dodging attacks!\nThough I wish I didn’t have to...
I’ve heard there’s this gang in\nLumiose that helps out Emma.
I wonder how many steps it’d\ntake to walk around Lumiose?
I totally show it on my face whenever I’m up\nagainst a type I know I can’t beat in battle...\r\nthen I get beat in no time by my opponent.
I guess part of growing up is learning to play it\ncool. For now, maybe you need a new strategy?
Do you think the benches around here can hold\neven really heavy Pokémon?
Benches are nice. Sometimes you just need to\ntake a break.
If the Pokémon really wanted to, they could\ndestroy Lumiose in no time...
Why do you work?
Don’t get me wrong, I like money.\nBut really, I just enjoy my job.
Where do Pokémon come from?\nAnd where do they go?
Just because everyone else does\nsomething doesn’t mean I have to.
Big-picture stuff is beyond me.\nI just leave it to the visionaries.
I wish I could’ve made one\nof those Trainer PR Videos...
As a Pokémon Trainer, what do I need to do to\nwin battles?
If you want to get stronger, the best thing to do is\nlevel up your Pokémon!
Would you happen to know\nof a man called Mr. Bonding?
[~ 281]
Really? I just straight up challenge them to a\nbattle so I can see whose Pokémon is stronger.
If I see someone walking around with the same\nPokémon as me, I can’t help but say hi!
Should we book rooms at\nHotel Richissime after all?
That promo video for Hotel Z\nwas...a bit cringey, wasn’t it?
It certainly had passion\nand energy, but yeah...
It’s tough finding the energy for Pokémon battles\nday after day...\c\nEspecially once you become a working adult\ntrying to hold down a job.
I see... That’s certainly something.\n(How am I supposed to respond to that...?)
Me and my partner Pokémon get along TOO well.\nI must’ve been a Pokémon in my past life!
I’m a member of the Pokédex Research Society!\c\nLet’s see... If I were to write Weedle’s entry\nmyself, I would put down something like...\c\n“If Weedle is no longer able to live in a tree where\nit has made its home, it will seek another tree to\r\nlive in, using its red nose to find one that it likes.”
There are so many Pokémon now\nthat it’s changed the city’s smell.
An installation piece!\nThe space is the art!
I always sleep better\non a tatami bed.
I deliver not just information\nabout the city, but also...love!
Someday I’m gonna take on Ingo\nand Emmet on the Multi Train!
I don’t know, but maybe someday we’ll have to\nbattle an AI Champion.
Do you think we’d win all our battles if we asked\nan AI for instructions?
If you’re too weak as a Trainer, your partner\nPokémon will get sad.
I’m an ordinary man by day, but by\nnight...I’m still an ordinary man.
Think a weakened Thunderbolt\ncould be used for a massage?
Whenever I’m lonely, I talk to\nmy Pokémon in their Poké Balls.
I’m glad to have travel recommendations, but\nshould I be finding my own experiences instead?
There are a lot more wild Pokémon around lately,\nright? I’ve heard they’ve been fighting over food.
In a city this big, I bet I could\nfind a doppelgänger of myself!
Whatever happened to that\nnews anchor lady, Malva?
The Rust Syndicate folks\nare really nice to me!
Look at how long we’ve been together... And it all\nstarted because we liked the same Pokémon.
To think, I’d never have met her at all if I didn’t\nhappen to send Meowstic into battle that day...
What’s the point of a\nday off if you don’t rest?
It’s hard to come by, but Skiddo\ncheese is quite the delicacy.
Even if you reach that point where you can’t seem\nto beat your opponents anymore, you can always\r\nhave fun with your Pokémon.
My customers are more interested in what I bring\nthem than they are in the guy bringing it.\r\nI know that. But still...
The best souvenirs to bring home from a trip are\nsurely Pokémon from the region you’re visiting!
Think I’ll grab some fruit from the\ncorner shop before I head home.
[~ 315]
Furisode have such long sleeves. It’s really\nunbe-sleeve-able!\c\n...Elesa taught me that joke herself, OK?
I’m going to find and read each\nand every Trainer Tips board!
I think I’ll try an underhand throw\nnext time I toss a Poké Ball.
Pokémon with a good sense of smell are great as\npolice Pokémon.
Iris versus Drayton? Now that’d be a match worth\nwatching!
“I don’t have the talent” is what\npeople afraid of hard work say!
No talent? You can compensate\nwith knowledge and experience!
TO BE DELETED
TO BE DELETED
When I catch a Pokémon, I become its “OT,” right?\nWhat does that mean?
That stands for Original Trainer. It just means that\nyou were the person who caught that Pokémon!
[~ 327]
There’s so much info about Pokémon! It’s easy to\nget overwhelmed unless you think for yourself.
My customers teach me all I need\nto know about cooking well. [VAR BD0A(000A)]Text_icon1
Time to Roto-Glide! That’s right!\nI’ll be soaring through the sky!
If you’re drained from work,\nmicrowave meals save time.
I wonder if it’s really a Trainer’s duty to cheer on\na battling Pokémon even when it can’t win...
You feel happy when someone’s cheering for you,\nright? I bet it’s the same for Pokémon.
The air is cleaner in high places, and it’s so quiet.\nIt’s really the best place to be.
The only drawback about spending time on the\nrooftop is that you have to go back down.
People flock to me when\nI send my Pokémon out!
They’re interested in your\nPokémon, not you...
I wanna chase the Pokémon\nflying above Lumiose!
That’s not how you do it!\nGet them to chase you!
I’ll rise through the Z-A Royale ranks and prove\nthat I’m worthy of taking over my dad’s company!
DYN4MO has plenty of female members, but the\nwhole group just seems so intense...
We’d have to get you one of those\nMega Rings from Quasartico then.
I really wanna Mega Evolve\nmy Garchomp in battle.
Then what about those rumors\nof a Floette with a black flower?
Floette can be found holding\na flower in one of five colors!
There’s red and yellow, and then\norange and blue and white, yeah?
The move Heavy Slam deals more damage the\nheavier the Pokémon using it is!
Why do Pokémon become small and go into\nPoké Balls?
The purpose of life is\nsimply to enjoy living.
With my partner Pokémon\nat my side, I feel invincible!
Hmm, we’re almost out of money... There aren’t\ntoo many people battling during the day here.
I heard you can make some decent money by\nparticipating in the Z-A Royale!
Watching you battle is always informative, Sis. I\nmay have some notes for you, though.
Well, we can discuss it over dinner, my\ndependable coach.
Ugh! I totally woke up on the\nwrong side of the bed today!
[~ 356]
I’m thinking I’ll visit all five plazas here in\nLumiose City.
One victory’s all you need to feel good, even if\nyou’ve lost a hundred times. Kinda unfair, isn’t it?
I’m going to invent a new dance\nstyle inspired by Pokémon moves!
Who designed the Rust Syndicate\nHQ? What were they thinking?
Better keep that kind\nof opinion to yourself.
The trick to not getting lost in Lumiose is using\nyour map. Not much of a secret, I know.
Pokémon don’t always listen\nto the orders you give them?
It’s for the best, really.\nSome orders are pretty bad.
The Pokémon always wake me\nup in the morning... Always...
Who needs to follow trends when you can just\ncome up with your own style?
What should we get for\nour second Pokémon?
A cool Pokémon!
Something that covers your first\nPokémon’s weaknesses, maybe?
Any kind is all right, as long\nas you take good care of it!
Hey, for Water-type moves, do you think Pokémon\nuse their sweat? Or other bodily fluids?
My Delibird and I had a fateful encounter!
I’m thinking about retiring, to be honest. I’m no\ngood to my partner if I can’t win battles...
Do what feels right to you. Just remember, you\ncan retire any time.
I really want to move,\nbut the rent is just...
I know. Goods may get cheaper,\nbut rent just doesn’t go down.
Hey, I think we should follow a\nwild Pokémon! See where it goes!
You sure? What if we end\nup in its den or something?
You gotta have people willing\nto do what others won’t.
The city’s always changing, so if\nyou see a nice sight, take a photo!
Seems like most apartments let\nyou keep Pokémon these days.
Don’t just use the same move over and over—mix\nthings up! Battle using a multitude of moves!
Lumiose used to have a lot of Skiddo. Did they all\ngo to the Baa de Mer Ranch?
Simply having Lumiose City as their backdrop\nmakes wild Pokémon look somehow stylish!
If you’re lucky! A serious attack\ncould just spell the end for you!
One bad hit, and you wake\nup in a Pokémon Center...
It’s scary running into\nwild Pokémon! Right?
I give whatever doesn’t sell to\nPokémon when I close up. [VAR BD0A(000A)]Text_icon1
Maybe it’s time you start looking to the future\ninstead of staying stuck in the past?
I can’t forget that Pokémon I failed to catch. I\nwonder if I’ll ever run into it again...
Eesh, I made my folks cry again...\njust ’cause I helped ’em out a bit!
I slept great, and now I’m gonna\nbe late. Life’s full of trade-offs.
Fluttering sleeves can\nhelp attract Pokémon.
Maybe I should try wearing\none of those furisode things.
Simply having Pokémon with me makes the\nwhole world seem a little brighter.
You’ve just gotta win!
My partner bites my butt\nwhen we lose in battles.
I guess it really\nhates losing...
I love it when I’m staring out the\nwindow and a Pokémon appears.
Running alone is rough. It’s feels way better\nwhen I call out my Pokémon to race with me.
I’m looking for Prism\nTower souvenirs!
My throwing form is perfect!\nBut my accuracy is awful...
I want to become a florist so I\ncan work alongside Pokémon.
With all these Pokémon gathering in the city, I\nwonder what they consider to be their territory?
I’m part of the Pokédex Research Society.\c\nIf I could write my own Pokédex entry for\nWatchog, I would say...\c\n“It makes its eyes light up using luminescent\nmatter contained within its body. A particular\r\nWatchog was once famed for its comedic\r\ninterjections on the ’What’s That?’ TV show.”
[~ 406]
So start now! Better\nlate than never, right?
There’s so much I wish I’d\ndone while I was young...
Some sights might look familiar,\nbut it’s not how I remember it.
The value of Pokémon doesn’t merely lie in how\nstrong they are.
My Pidgeot can’t ever seem win a battle...
I never see him around anymore.\nWhatever happened to him?
Didn’t you hear? He moved\nback to his hometown.
Sales make me a salesman.\nDo battles make me a Poké-man?
[~ 415]
I guess that’s one way to do it. But I think I’d still\nrather raise my own Pokémon myself, y’know?
That guy in class with the perfect grades says he\nhas someone raise his Pokémon for him.
Once I get home, I need to clean\nup all the fur my Pokémon sheds!
Where should I go on holiday?\nMaybe I’ll let my Pokémon decide.
Travel is best when\nyou’re young and poor.
Anything supernatural can be considered occult.\nAnd Pokémon are certainly fantastic beings.\r\nErgo, Pokémon are part of the occult!
I’ve always had Pokémon around, ever since I was\nborn. It’s crazy to me how some people don’t\r\nmeet their first Pokémon until they’re grown up.
Reflecting on your mistakes is an\nimportant part of moving forward.
I’d rather just move forward than\nkeep focusing on what’s done.
I want to discover a new me!\nI’ve got to make new art!
What brand of Pokémon\nshampoo do you buy?
My partner’s a Fire type, so I’m\nnever sure what to use on it!
No wonder your Pokémon\nare fed up with you!
I made my Pokémon keep on\nbattling without healing its HP...
When I play the piano,\nmy Pokémon dance.
Pokémon battles are just a series of choices!\c\nSometimes you make the wrong choice, but you\njust gotta make a better one next time!
I’ve heard there are these stupidly big Pokémon\ncalled “alpha Pokémon” around!
Apparently if you send out your partner Pokémon,\nthen wild Pokémon will target it instead of you.
I’ve got to hurry home to wipe\ndown my sweaty Pokémon...
I just want to be a good\nTrainer to my Pokémon.
My teacher is a Machamp! He knows a lot of\nsecrets, but it can be tricky to understand him...
What d’you mean you’re learning how to battle\nfrom Pokémon?
You’ll just have to make it work. You know you’ve\ngot to win!
A citywide hide-and-seek game,\nthey said... I can’t find anyone!
n/a
When you want a thing,\nthat’s the time to buy it.
[~ 442]
You know, Pokémon get friendlier toward their\nTrainer the more they level up!
Which wild zone should we hit today?
I wanna level up my Pokémon some more before\nwe head into any wild zone...
If your Pokémon’s been poisoned, you’d better\ntake it to the Pokémon Center to get healed!
Speaking the same language is\nno guarantee of understanding...
Every day is pretty similar,\nyet every day is full of fun!
I’m not letting any Pokémon get\nmy packages from me today!
I train so that I’ll be ready to immediately send out\nmy team in those times when it really counts.
Is there a Pokémon somewhere\nthat’ll do my homework for me?
My Pokémon just won’t\nstop gazing at me lovingly!
My Pokémon refuses to\ngo back in its Poké Ball.
My Cleffa is positively dauntless! It goes right\nafter the Pokémon it finds in wild zones.
Ah, Lumiose, great jewel of the Kalos region...\nWill I ever be able to plumb your full depths?
I simply never get tired of\nwatching Pokémon at play.
I just wanna find that one café—\nfrom that old film with Diantha!
Looking down on Lumiose from\nthe rooftops is pretty sweet.
I want to do sightseeing\nhere after dark too!
I can sense it clearly...\nThe aura of defeat...
Some alleys have Pokémon in ’em.\nYou might get hit with a move...
How can anyone call the\nZ-A Royale their job?
I love the sound of shoes\nslapping on the pavement.
Gosh, I miss chasing after those\nGogoat that went around town.
If I get lost in Lumiose City,\nI’m just grabbing a taxi!
I have my Pokémon express the\nfeelings I keep pent up inside.
I just check out anything that catches my eye\nwhile I’m out doing the regular big grocery run.
Half the fun of shopping is waffling over all the\nenticing options you find before you!
I say it’s best to decide what you mean to buy\nbefore you head out to the shops.
Winning the Z-A Royale\nwould be life-changing.
It sucks when all you see\nout the window is scaffolding.
Just strolling the streets makes\nme feel like a part of Lumiose!
I wonder if Pokémon like all the\nhustle and bustle of the city.
I’m going shopping at\nNaptime on my next day off!
Some say Pokémon take orders\nbecause they want to use moves.
It’s just no fair! Us kids can’t take part in the Z-A\nRoyale just because it’s always at night!
I get that you want to join the Z-A Royale, but I\nstill think we’re too young...
I don’t think they’re trying to be mean. It’s just\n’cause you keep falling asleep in class!
Man, the grown-ups just keep treating us all like\nlittle kids!
I always aim to finish my\ndeliveries before nightfall!
It’s fun watching\nthe Z-A Royale.
[~ 482]
Vert? You know this is the Bleu District, right?
Can you tell me how to get to Vert Sector 5?
I hear some people use fake\nnames to join the Z-A Royale.
I don’t get this Z-A Royale...\nDo people just want to brawl?
I’ve been a Pokémon Trainer for 20 years now, but\nI’ve never gotten any stronger...
But you must love being a Trainer, right? After all,\nyou’ve stuck with it for 20 years already!
I witnessed a fierce showdown\nbetween tea- and coffee-lovers.
Some schoolkids have\nPokémon as bodyguards.
I want to take the backstreets,\nbut I’m also a little afraid to...
I’ll break any rule for my art...as\nlong as I don’t hurt anyone.
We should battle!\nIt’s been forever!
We could battle, but I’ll win.\nI’ve been training nonstop.
TMs...\nTMs...
You can use Rotom Phones\neven in other regions!
No matter what comes at me,\nmy Pokémon will fight it back.
If you hope to win even when you’re down to just\none Pokémon, you’ve got to focus on moves that\r\ncan boost both your offense and defense.
I keep on dishing out attacks, but I can’t win if\nthe other Pokémon keep on dodging them!
What do you think is most important when it\ncomes to Pokémon battles?
You’ve gotta use moves that get out before your\nopponent’s. Even better if they cause status\r\nconditions too.
I can’t wait for\nmy next day off...
Grandma, teach me\nabout Pokémon battles!
You still need to master\nthose type matchups!
Best to learn by doing!\nNow, who should I send out...
A backpacker can be a Pokémon Trainer too! Not\nthat I am, but I could be!
Just like people, Pokémon vary widely. Their\ngender can be male, female, or unknown.
Lunch is the time for talking with your colleagues.\nWe love to chat about which Pokémon we like.\r\nThough it can get so heated we end up battling!
I’m running low\non Poké Balls...
She pretends to vent about her\nboyfriend, but it’s really bragging...
What street is this?
If only Gengar could chill my blood for me... For\nnow, I’m stuck finding shade to rest under.
Trubbish, little lady.
What was your first-ever partner Pokémon,\nGrampa?
An alpha in the back alley?!\nNo way, that’d be disastrous!
I often find myself here without\neven meaning to come.
City Pokémon, wild Pokémon—\nthey just keep on increasing!
Listen, you get me, right?\nRunning is about speed!

Get your Lumiose Galettes here!\nLoved by man and ’mon alike! [VAR BD0A(000A)]Text_icon1
Make sure you’re ready for the\nPokémon in the back alleys! [VAR BD0A(000A)]Text_icon1
You know, a good ambiance really\naffects the flavor of your meal! [VAR BD0A(000A)]Text_icon1
It’s a big shock when an opponent\nsends out a big Pokémon in battle!
I’ll get a bunch of Mega Shards\nand trade them for Mega Stones!
The battle zones that activate at night are scary!\nI’ll stick to battle courts during the day, thank you.
When you fall in love with someone, you fall in\nlove with their voice, the sound of their footsteps,\r\neven the sounds they make when they eat!
My absolute favorite brand is Valerie Kawaguchi!
I need a new place, but it’s gotta\nbe big enough for my Pokémon...
I heard there’s a Poké Ball that never fails to catch\nPokémon. It’s called a Master Ball!
Everyone keeps talking about coexisting with\nPokémon, but I can’t help but wonder if anyone’s\r\nasked the Pokémon what THEY want.
Some directors shoot footage on\ntheir Rotom Phones, don’t they?
Thanks to safe landing mode,\nthey can even film up on cliffs!
I think it’d be nice to live in a\ntent up on a roof somewhere...
Wild Pokémon should be able\nto live freely on our rooftops.
You gotta enjoy whatever comes\nat you if you want a carefree life.
That incident caused by Team Flare five years ago\nset a lot of things in motion here in Lumiose.
I should buy Berries\nfor my Pokémon...
People just love our baguettes,\nbutter, and rustic boule loaves.
Mix oil, vinegar, and mustard,\nand you’ve got dressing! [VAR BD0A(000A)]Text_icon1
I had some real satisfying wins in\nmy Z-A Royale matches last night.
Gah. My shortest route goes over a\nroof that’s crawling with Pokémon.
Is feeding wild Pokémon bad?
The teacher said we should let wild Pokémon find\nfood on their own, like in nature.
Riolu uses its aura to\nsense what’s around it.
We furisode girls are known for battling with\nAudino as our partner Pokémon!
I like to spend my days standing outside wild\nzones, watching all the wild Pokémon inside.
Just running the same old\nroute at my usual pace.
I’d like to try out the Z-A Royale, but my vacation\nisn’t long enough for me to climb up the ranks.
I’m gathering Colorful Screws so I can keep\nexpanding my collection of Canari plush.
By night, I patrol the streets for the Z-A Royale.\nBy day...I pray the city stays quiet.
Yes! I’m a rich boy!
Physical walls, I can smash. Walls\nholding me back in life, though...
On our next test, we’ve gotta spell\nevery single Pokémon name right!
Well, I know what type\nevery Pokémon is.
I’d rather learn by battling...
If you want to be like a Trainer you\nadmire, study up on them!
Don’t sink too many hours into work, or your\npartner Pokémon will get lonely!
I vent all my stress in my Z-A Royale matches. My\nPokémon do, too!
[~ 39]
People used to be able to take a quiz inside Prism\nTower a few years ago. It was pretty fun...
My thoughts always get muddled\nwhen I try to put them into words.
Maybe I should’ve waited until\nit could learn more moves...?
I know traveling won’t change my\nlife...but I can’t stop doing it!
No one can see our inner selves,\nso I make my outer self look great!
You know, Spritzee give\noff a wonderful aroma.
How are Pokémon able\nto learn moves, anyway?
Pokémon are so smart—they can\nunderstand their Trainer’s orders!
The strongest Trainers are those who can use\nMega Evolution.\c\nI hear the top ranks of the Z-A Royale are filled\nwith Trainers who Mega Evolve their Pokémon.
Let’s go to Café Gallant and get\nourselves a Gallant Dark Roast!
Didn’t we go\nthere yesterday?
Well, my vote goes\nto Café Triste!
No one can beat my Pinsir!
My Heracross is the strongest!
C’mon, let’s do Paldea next.
I’d really rather go to Galar...
Learning moves of various types means you’ll be\nable to handle all sorts of opponents.
I wanna go\nsee a movie!
We’re not going anywhere\nuntil you two agree...
I wanna go\nshopping!
Nouveau Café is sort of\nlike a self-help group. [VAR BD0A(000A)]Text_icon1
I heard that this real strong Trainer called Leon\ngot completely lost when he visited Lumiose!
I wanna make my Pokémon strong so grown-ups\ncan’t tell me what to do anymore!
That’s what’s great about Pokémon battles, right?\nEven kids like us can win against adults.
I love chatting with old friends at our usual café,\nenjoying the same food we always order.
I think things are going good,\nbut I still feel uneasy somehow...
Huh. I just remembered that huge\nblackout we had five years ago.
Nothing says “Z-A Royale life” like rousing yourself\nwith a hot cup of coffee as you watch the sunrise.
Lumiose is the city\nof gourmet cuisine!
Ahh, my phone’s out of battery...\nGuess I used it too much today.
Remember to recharge your own\nbatteries, too, once we’re home!
Going on walks is more fun when\nyou can name the flowers you see!
I thought working for Nouveau\nwould be more exciting than this...
[~ 73]
I want to battle opponents I can beat!\c\nBut I can’t go around asking people what\nPokémon they use before I battle them...
Want to win battles even when the type matchup\nisn’t in your favor? Then you gotta level up!
What happens in Lumiose stays in Lumiose...so it\ndoesn’t matter if I lose all my battles here!
We should have a contest to\ncrown Lumiose’s best café! [VAR BD0A(000A)]Text_icon1
I just watch films I like—I never\npay attention to the reviews.
I can’t wait to see that\nnew film Diantha’s in!
Attack or defend? It depends\non your position on the field.
Don’t you get scared climbing ladders? And being\nhigh up?
Naw, it’s fine if I have my Rotom Phone. Even if I\nfall, it’ll catch me!
Battle courts... They’re where Trainers and their\nPokémon should be putting it all on the line!
I’m terrible at battles, but I like\ngiving commentary on them.
What a narrow alley... Hope I don’t\nget ambushed by wild Pokémon.
Wouldn’t it be great if we had a gizmo that works\nlike a TM, but for human use? We’d be able to\r\nmemorize all sorts of things at the drop of a hat!
You can’t change the nickname of\na Pokémon you got in a trade.
Urk. I’m so sorry for giving a weird\nname to the Pokémon I traded you.
Nothing can attack you from\nbehind if your back’s to the wall.
My backpack contains everything I need for travel.\nAnd my Poké Balls contain my precious partners!
Holovators and ladders are used for similar\npurposes, but they’re pretty different!
What a gorgeous kimono. I wonder if it’s a\nvintage piece?
This particular furisode is worth about 200\nBig Nuggets.
[~ 94]
Trubbish is cute, but you gotta be\ncareful of the toxic gas it belches.
Apparently all the bamboo at the Rust Syndicate\noffice was planted for their Pangoro to use.
I only listen to electronic music.
I hate that the Z-A Royale only happens at night.\nThey should do it during the day sometimes so\r\nkids can join in, too!
Surprise attacks are allowed in the Z-A Royale\nsince all the participating Trainers agreed to it.
That’s right. It’s important to obey the rules—even\nmore so to make them in the first place.
I wish I could have a clever\nPokémon do my job for me...
Emma found my lost Patrat when I asked her\nfor help!
Emma’s super strong, isn’t she?
She wore that cool suit, too!
I can’t help but wonder what was\ngoing on in Lysandre’s head...
Where are all the people\nfrom Team Flare now?
I just want to go to a wild zone and\ndodge Pokémon’s attacks! [VAR BD0A(000A)]Text_icon1
I wonder if there are any\nPokémon that like coffee... [VAR BD0A(000A)]Text_icon1
I fight with my Pokémon over\nBerries when I’m hungry... [VAR BD0A(000A)]Text_icon1
Everyone has a different Pokémon\nthat they think is the strongest.
I’ve battled like a maniac over the\nyears. Lost every time, but still. [VAR BD0A(000A)]Text_icon1
What does “coexistence”\neven mean, really? [VAR BD0A(000A)]Text_icon1
I slave away at work during the day, then battle it\nout in the Z-A Royale at night...\c\nWhen am I supposed to sleep?
I can’t wait to go home\nand dote on my Pokémon!
It’s great up on the rooftops, huh?\c\nYou’ll sometimes even find rare Pokémon and\nhuge clusters of Mega Crystals up here.
I love being up high. If only I\ncould climb Prism Tower...
Yes, people visit cafés for the food.\nBut mostly, they just want to talk.
I gotta stop moping about that\ntime I chose the wrong move.
Sure, Pokémon are amazing for being able to\nbattle. But so are Trainers!\c\nThey need to make split-second calls in high-\nstress situations, after all.
When I think about how Pokémon are able to\nunderstand and act on their Trainer’s orders,\r\nI’m like...wow. Pokémon are amazing!
Should I polish my strong points\nor cover my weak points...?
Ooh, that pesky Galarian... Was he\navenging his ancestors or what?
I took a different route today...\nand I’m now completely lost.
I just... I just wanted to battle\nthat Trainer one more time...
Ohmygosh! I forgot to snap a\npic at the café for my socials.
I don’t care about which café is\ntrending online. I go where I like!
Lumiose City is enormous...
[~ 128]
Rule one: no mishaps! Rule two: read the\nsituation and act accordingly!
One second of carelessness\ncan lead to a lifetime of regret.
Yesterday was incident-free, but\nthat doesn’t mean today will be!
Safety first!
Work equipment: checked!\nBag items: double-checked!
Chasing off wild Pokémon is part of our job, too.
There are more wild Pokémon\nstealing our electricity lately.
[~ 136]
I want to do a job that lets me test my skills\nagainst people from all over the world.
You know what lets you take on the world?\nPokémon battling!
Rooftops are THE place to\nspend your breaks, am I right?
There are always the same people sitting at the\nsame tables at the same café at the same time...\r\nbut I’ve never talked with any of them.
The secret to winning battles?\nJust keep trying till you win.
Diantha’s focusing on her\nacting career right now.
You should just keep\nusing strong moves!
No, you should keep\nusing fast moves!
When the urban redevelopment plan wraps up,\nit’ll be tough finding work in construction...
We leave the heavy lifting on-site to Pokémon. It\nmakes sense, since they’re better at it.
We Canatics need to keep the chat\npopping during Canari’s streams!
What are you thinking for this year’s vacation?
Hm... Maybe a Treasure Hunt in Paldea?
My next delivery is to a top-floor\napartment? All those stairs...
When I die, I’d like to be buried in\nthe same grave as my Pokémon.
I wish I could put my whole\nbackpack in a Poké Ball, too.
I wonder what I could get for winning the whole\nZ-A Royale?
Mega Evolution is so crazy powerful, it could end\nup hurting Pokémon...
Siebold left the Elite Four\nto polish his culinary skills.
Sometimes I have to make deliveries while\nPokémon are attacking or chasing me...
You have to wear a furisode if you want to work at\nSushi High Roller.
That mayor, outsourcing our urban\ndevelopment to some foreign firm!
It’s Team Flare’s fault for\ncausing that huge incident!
I hear Mega Stones and Mega\nCrystals are made of similar stuff.
How do I get my Pokémon\nto grow up strong?
I owe my life to the\nRust Syndicate...
[~ 163]
I hate waking up in the mornings,\nand I hate falling asleep at night!
I love pretty much\nanything I get to eat!
It’s strange being on a rooftop and looking down\nat people below or at Pokémon in the wild zones.
Have you ever taken a relaxing sip of hot coffee,\nthen spat it out because it’s too hot?
On days off work, it’s nice to bring food over to\nyour friend or family’s house, then spend the day\r\nrelaxing and chatting together.
I can tell if a Pokémon gets\non well with its Trainer! [VAR BD0A(000A)]Text_icon1
Showers seem to be more\npopular than baths in Lumiose.
You can’t sweat the small stuff\nif you want to live a happy life.
So what if I wear the same outfit\nevery day? I’m expressing myself.
No one’s ever actually seen a lost Poké Ball\ncollector picking up people’s Poké Balls...
Being the Champion is cool, but being in the top\nrank of the Z-A Royale would be cool too.
It’s wonderful that we can encounter wild\nPokémon right here in the city without having\r\nto travel far away.
Whatever happened to Professor Sycamore’s\nassistants? Dexio and Sina, weren’t they?
Whenever I mess up, I make sure\nto send my partner a bouquet...
I just want things to calm down...\nI need some rest and relaxation!
When I get tired, I like to go to the\nrooftop and just scream out loud!
I came here to catch Pokémon\nyou can only find in Lumiose!
Faster than yesterday! More than yesterday!\c\nI always try to beat my performance from the day\nbefore.
One of the best battles I ever saw was between\nLeon and Raihan in the Galar region.
The joy of living with Pokémon only increases as\nthe years go by.
I wish Pokémon class\nwas just about battling.
My bed’s nice and soft, so I let my Pokémon sleep\non it. I get the hard sofa.
A traveling carnival used to come here when I was\na little girl. I adored the carousel—it always felt\r\nlike I was riding a Pokémon!
Standing in the sun gets\nme heated up for battle!
I’m picking up fallen\nfeathers again today.
Do you think a Pokémon\ncould be mayor someday?
It’s just not possible to see\neverything in Lumiose!
Anyone who has a Pokémon is a Trainer, but it’s\nnot as if they all want to be the very best.
Seeing paw prints left by Pokémon in wet\nconcrete fills me with joy.
My Pichu may not look like it, but it’s my\nbodyguard!
My friend once said: “If I turn into a lousy\ngrown-up, promise me you’ll punch me!”\c\nI wonder where he is now...
Won’t all of Lumiose be covered in wild zones at\nthis rate?
You know Lebanne from the SBC? The one who’s\nalways following around after Jacinthe?\c\nWell, I heard she used to be big in some kind of\nfighting scene, but I wonder if that’s true...
I only want to eat tasty food. Who\nknows how many meals I got left?
I always feel great when\nthe weather’s nice!
Trainers need to keep switching the best\nPokémon into battle as the situation changes.
The number of wild Pokémon\naround the city is soaring.
*sigh* Another day without being\nreincarnated as a Pokémon...
[~ 202]
I wanna play soccer with the\nPokémon in the wild zones!
I wanna run all around\nLumiose and play tag!
I’d rather play hide-and-seek,\nbut I don’t think it’d ever end.
I’ve been changing my daily\nroutines to match my Pokémon’s.
Isn’t it great? You can sleep\nwhenever you feel tired!
It really makes you feel alive.
When a Pokémon’s type matches the type of the\nmove it uses, that move gets a power boost!
Still, it comes in handy to teach your Pokémon all\nsorts of moves—even if a move’s type doesn’t\r\nmatch your Pokémon’s type.
I could chat about that book for\nhours! Hope my friends read it too.
I’m gonna spend my entire life answering the\nquestion of how Mega Stones are made!
More and more people are using food delivery\nservices these days. We’re as busy as anything!
I’ll live my very best life and\nbecome the me I want to be!
When you think about how much time you’ll be\nspending with the Pokémon you catch, it makes\r\nyou consider carefully before throwing the ball.
Lumiose is changing real fast. I wonder what it’ll\nbe like here by the time I’m grown up.
When Banette looked at me, I felt\nlike I heard it say, “Not this one.”
I felt something following me, so\nI turned and...it was a Haunter!
This one time when I was in bed,\nI saw a Spinarak on the ceiling.
I don’t collect Pokémon just for the sake of it—it’s\nmy obsession! I think that’s a certain kind of love.
That’s right... My fixation on Ghost-type Pokémon\nis simply love in a different form...
Why do people wonder why I’ve got Simisage as\nmy partner? I just really developed a liking for it.
Picking a backstreet like this as a meetup spot is\njust asking for both parties to get horribly lost.
Think, THINK! What souvenir\ncan I only get here in Lumiose?
No time for sightseeing—I want to\nbattle! It’s the Z-A Royale for me!
So as you go out from Centrico\nPlaza, it’s Sector 1...then 2...
My bed’s super effective at making\nme drowsy. Mornings are tough!
Lumiose is a chic city, sure, but it’s tough living\nhere. Holding down a job, dealing with rent...\r\nand don’t even get me started on the people!
I’m glad there’ll be more Pokémon around the\ncity, but we should first make sure that the needs\r\nof all the humans who live here are being met.
It seems that sales of Poké Balls and other goods\nfor Pokémon are booming all over the city.
[~ 231]
My dad works for Quasartico, so I’m allowed to\nuse their battle court too.
Vinnie is teaching me a lot about battling!
I hear a lot of Quasartico’s employees are talented\nbattlers. It’s probably because the company deals\r\nin Pokémon goods.
Lots of people are buying\nthings for Pokémon lately. [VAR BD0A(000A)]Text_icon1
If Pokémon join the workforce,\nwhat’ll happen to human workers?
I wonder why Pokémon\ncome here to the city?
Everyone wants to become\nstronger than their past self!
I found it hard fitting in\nwhen I first moved here.
Thinking is my job. And to\ndo that well, I need to relax.
If you practice something a lot, it\nsimply becomes muscle memory!
One day I’m gonna be a big company boss and\nhave a big building like this one!
Quasartico’s president is so dignified and cool.
What a huge building...
How in the world is the holo-tech\nyou see in wild zones even made?
We get a lot of Quasartico\nemployees as customers.
Quasartico recruits Trainers\nwho show potential in battle.
Hunger is the very best\nseasoning for a tasty dinner!
I usually work remote, but I had\nto come in for a battle today.
Should I have a bento for lunch?\nThat’d be the nice, healthy option.
I heard they found Mega Stones when they were\ndigging for the urban redevelopment plan.
Vinnie may look scary, but he\nreally dotes on that kid of his.
This urban redevelopment plan\nmeans there’s never a slow day...
People say that the first Pokémon in Kalos to\nundergo Mega Evolution was a Lucario.
I wanted to soak in the sights and sounds of\nLumiose my way, so I tossed the guidebook!
Don’t you think the stylists here in Lumiose are\nunbelievably good at dyeing hair?
The incident with Team Flare five years ago sent\nshock waves through the whole of Kalos.
Running helps me release all the stress I get from\nlosing battles.
Pokémon living in the city may be able to form\nnew kinds of relationships with humans.
All day, it’s deliveries to Quasartico\nand pickups from Quasartico...
I won’t let myself be outshone\nby those Dedenne guards...
We need regulations to manage\nthe rise in Pokémon numbers.
I wish someone would research\nthe Pokémon living in the city.
With more Pokémon around, will\nthere be less room for people?
[~ 265]
What’s going to happen\nto Prism Tower?
There’s no escaping from wild Pokémon if you\nrun into them on scaffolding.
Nuh-uh! If you have a Rotom Phone, you can just\njump off like “look out belooow!”
Racine Construction’s scaffolding is good and\nsturdy, but you still shouldn’t play around on it.
You meet many good people in\nlife, but lots of bad ones too.
Nothing better than a fresh-baked\nbaguette with heaps of butter!
Huh?! You can’t poison a\nPoison-type Pokémon?
Valerie is from a far-off region called Johto.
A wild Pokémon ran off with my packages in one\nof the back alleys near here.\c\nI chased after it and got them back, but I couldn’t\nhave done it without my partner Pokémon.
In the Z-A Royale, I’d recommend sneaking up on\nyour opponents and their Pokémon, then catching\r\nthem off guard with a surprise attack!
I’ll help you\nhowever I can!
Today’s the day I find my\ndream partner Pokémon!
It’s love that brings people and\nPokémon together, not Poké Balls.
I feel like I was destined to meet\nall the Pokémon I’ve caught. [VAR BD0A(000A)]Text_icon1
You gotta throw lots of Poké Balls\nto earn a Pokémon’s respect!
Pokémon and their\nTrainers are like family.
I heard that some people leave Potions lying\naround to help injured Pokémon.
My luggage was stolen right after I arrived in\nLumiose...\c\nLuckily, it was just a prank and I was able to get\nall my stuff back.
[~ 284]
Your Houndoom is an impressive specimen—it’s\njust as fearsome as it is adorable!
Your Gabite is similarly delightful. You don’t see\nthat species too often, so I approve of the choice.
Rumor has it a darkly colored\nPokémon appears at night.
Oh yes—it’s been seen with\nsome shady-looking man, right?
There’s all kinds of Pokémon around the world.\nThey use all sorts of moves, battle in different\r\nways, and all have their own way of living!
Go where you want,\ndie where you must.
Tonight I’m getting a ticket\nin the Z-A Royale for sure!
The very best way to start your day is with the\naroma of fresh bread and coffee!
I bet we’ll soon see a restaurant that caters only\nto Pokémon.
My Delibird keeps dropping\nBerries all over the place...
Mega Crystals showed up after\nurban redevelopment started.
The wild zones have apparently drawn even more\ntourists to come visit Lumiose.
Bridges are the best spots to pick when meeting\nup with friends in Lumiose. The area around\r\nPrism Tower is way too big to find anyone.
Corbeau from the Rust\nSyndicate is so cool!
Ivor from the Fist of Justice\nis super-duper strong!
No two days are the same, even if\nthey do feel repetitive sometimes.
I’m so good at sleeping, I can\ndo it with my eyes closed.
I can’t tell you how helpful it is that Pokémon\ncarry building materials up the scaffolding for us.
A city as big as Lumiose is going\nto have its fair share of drifters.
I’m a peerless Pokémon Trainer! Literally, in fact!\c\nNo one takes me up on my battle challenges...
Training your Pokémon isn’t the same as loving\nthem. You need to do other things together, too.
I love my Pokémon! They come and rub their fur\nagainst me when I’m feeling sad.
I heard that some of the Trainers competing in the\nZ-A Royale are gaining tons of fans lately.
I’m not a battler myself, but I like hearing about\nstrong Trainers and their Pokémon.
I never think about the past or future. Instead, I\ntreasure each moment of the present.
[~ 310]
Folks in Lumiose spend more time chatting after\nbattles than they do actually battling.
If you want to make your Pokémon strong, you\nyourself must first be strong.
No point having a huge place to\nyourself. A cozy room is just fine.
Even Pokémon of the same species all have\ndifferent strengths.
Pokémon raised by people will grow stronger than\nwild Pokémon, you know.
Wrinkles around the eyes are proof\nyou’ve spent a lifetime laughing.
Even if I don’t know what a move\ndoes, I teach it to my Pokémon.
The clerk at the Stone Emporium\nhas a weird laugh—like “Po-ho-ho!”
Pokémon resent their Trainers if\nthey’re knocked out often in battle.
Do you have your Pokémon hold items in battle?\nI’d recommend a Quick Claw, myself.
You know Sushi High Roller? Well, I heard the\nowner’s parents also run a sushi restaurant.\r\nI wonder what region they’re from...
I’m so grateful to my Pokémon for\nshaking up my monotonous life.
Humans can’t beat Pokémon in a\nfight, no matter how hard they try.
I remember playing pétanque\nin the plaza when I was little.
Pokémon can eat Berries on their\nown, but they can’t use Potions.
How about we join the Z-A Royale together? If we\nwatch each other’s backs, we’ll have a leg up over\r\nall the other Trainers!
I don’t hate the idea, but it’d reduce our mobility\na fair amount.
The world is vast! Boundless, even! There must be\nso many Pokémon out there no one’s ever seen!
I feel like Pokémon get me. Even\nif I’m just imagining it, it’s nice.
But still the only thing I can do is\nsing—sing my humble song. ♪
Maybe I can’t cheer someone on\njust with the tunes I play. ♪
Piers writes great\nmusic, doesn’t he?
I don’t know what this thing is, but when I look at\nit, it’s like my heart kinda squeezes.
I think it’s called an obelisk? It’s like a monument\nfor people to remember something.
I say Pokémon count as family. We make so many\nmemories together across the course of our lives.
My first memory is of Meowstic levitating me.
Life is wonderful when Pokémon are around to\nmake you laugh every day.
Feel free to browse our menu,\neven just out of curiosity.
During my travels in Paldea, I saw sculptures by\nan artist named Brassius. They were pretty good!
The Lumiose Museum should put some of them\ninto a special exhibition! I’d love to see them.
The water in Kalos is natural spring water—it’s\nbursting with minerals.
Different regions have different water, huh? Still,\nthey’re all called Fresh Water when bottled.
Keeping quiet won’t do you any\nfavors in life. Just talk, talk, talk!
Am I still a courier even when\nI’m not out making deliveries?
I’ve been battling for 50 years...\nThese old bones are tired of it.
You should save up your Mega Power so you can\nuse Plus Moves in battle.
I didn’t know that the Pokémon\nCenter staff works in shifts!
Cooking isn’t important for me—\nI just want to eat food I like.
I bet I could get in about a hundred steps with\none lap around Magenta Plaza.
The Ember Roast they serve at\nNouveau Café is sooo good!
I feel so relaxed when I have a\nFire-type Pokémon next to me.
What is it that makes\narthouse films artsy?
I wonder if battling comes instinctively to\nPokémon?
Use your days off for resting up.\nPlay with your Pokémon, OK?
Do Pokémon even want to coexist with humans in\nthe first place?
Art isn’t about understanding. It’s about wanting\nto paint, draw, and create!
So you’re working out to prepare\nfor going into the wild zones?
I haven’t jogged in a while, and...\nhoo boy, am I ever out of shape!
Didn’t Battle Tests\nuse to be a thing?
I like using Pokémon that people think are weak!\nIt really throws off opponents, and it feels great\r\nto win that way.
I...I can’t believe it.\nMy Pokémon lost?
Kalos has Mega Evolution, and\nPaldea has Terastallization...
Which would win: a Tera Pokémon\nor a Mega-Evolved Pokémon?
If a Pokémon’s Speed increases,\nit’ll be able to use its moves faster!
[~ 365]
When push comes to shove,\npeople show their true colors.
I could beat my manager in a\nbattle any day! It’s just not fair!
Folks in Lumiose love their\ncomic books, don’t they?
They say that Lumiose is called the City of Light\nbecause everyone comes here with their hopes\r\nand dreams, making the city sparkle.
I don’t wanna battle if that means watching my\nPokémon get hurt.
But what’s worse for the Pokémon, hm? Losing a\nbattle or two, or being weak forever?
The only thing Pokémon need in order to grow\nstrong is lots of love from their Trainer.
I get told a lot that I should pick\na strong Pokémon for my partner.
If you don’t say what you mean,\npeople will never understand you.
Pokémon use the moves their\nTrainers tell them to. Incredible!
Eating until I’m full makes me so happy!\c\n...Though I guess it also makes me unhappy since\nI can’t enjoy any more food after that.
The only furniture that fits in my\ntiny apartment is an old bed...
I need to finish my deliveries while it’s still light\nout, or I’ll get caught up in the Z-A Royale.
My room gets crowded if I let my\nPokémon loose, but I love it!
If you see a chance to take down your opponent,\nuse a fast move rather than a supereffective one!
[~ 381]
How many steps would it take\nto do one full lap of Lumiose?
Just another day humming\none of my unfinished songs.
I keep having this dream where I’m competing in\na Pokémon race that loops around Lumiose.\c\nI know a race like that probably isn’t possible\nbecause of all the wild zones, but still...
Magikarp are so weak, they can’t\neven swim against the current.
In Lumiose, no one bats an eye at\ngiant men or kids rolling around.
There’s a famous dancer named Tierno who’s\napparently making waves in Unova right now.
We police officers all had to pass a Pokémon\nbattle test to get this job, you know.
Folks were terrified of Pokémon\nlong ago, but now we coexist...
All these boats sitting quietly on\nthe canal... Where are they going?
The Saison Canal’s waters\nflow on as they always do...
Time passes in the blink of an eye\nwhen I’m deciding what to eat...
I like to sit on a bench and\nread when the weather’s nice.
Just like humans, Pokémon grow\neven more charming with age.
If there’s something you want to do, do it. Saving\nthings for later just means you might lose your\r\nmotivation and never get around to it.
“Formal” and “professional” don’t come easily to\nme. I like battling since I can just be myself.
The Society of Battle Connoisseurs makes its\nmembers learn how to battle elegantly.
The Lumiose Sewers were\nbuilt over a century ago.
You know Mable from the Pokémon Research\nLab?\c\nI wonder where she got all her Pokémon\nknowledge from.
Lumiose attracts folks from lots of different\nregions, so you can experience and enjoy all sorts\r\nof cultures here!
I’m out making deliveries, but I got myself lost.\nSeems I was looking at the map upside down...
I’ve met a bunch of friends\nthrough Pokémon battles.
C’est la vie, I suppose!
That dress Jacinthe likes to wear is the finest\nhaute couture—a one-of-a-kind piece.
That’s riiight. She has her own full-time designer,\ndoesn’t she?
There are plenty of restaurants in Lumiose I could\nrecommend, but I’d advise you to follow your gut.\c\nEven if you strike out, that’s a worthy experience\nin itself!
But I don’t want to waste my hard-earned\nvacation eating substandard food!
If you register your birthday at the Pokémon\nCenter, they’ll celebrate with you on the big day!
What seems strange to one person might not\nseem strange to another. I, for example, am\r\nutterly fixated on finding small-sized Pokémon.
My Pokémon is such a greedy\nthing! It just eats and eats...
How about some tasty Berries\nfor your Pokémon? [VAR BD0A(000A)]Text_icon1
A Pokémon holding a Berry in battle can eat it\nwithout you telling them to!
With all these Pokémon in the city, you have to be\nso careful when driving.
Hey, I know Lumiose doesn’t run on cars—it runs\non Pokémon. And I’m fine with that.
If you want to know things that only a cab driver\nwould know, then you should hail a cab!
So many strange things happen when you live\naround Pokémon that meeting a guy over nine\r\nfeet tall starts to feel like nothing special.
The soup comes with bread. We\nrecommend dipping generously.
Life’s about sleeping and eating—\nfor people and Pokémon both.
[~ 419]
People say Team Flare was a bunch of villains,\nbut their leader, Lysandre, did also help people\r\nwho were in need.
You’ll never know if you have an aptitude for\nsomething if you don’t try doing it.
When you abbreviate South\nBoulevard, you get “SoBo.”
Yes, fine, but you need to get\nthings done at some point!
Take things gently in the morning\nand without hurry in the evening.
I don’t have time\nto play around.
How about you battle with a different Pokémon\nfor a while? It’s important to learn new things.
I feel like I haven’t been getting the best out of my\nSimipour lately.
I’m just mad for that tense feeling\nas you watch a Poké Ball wobble!
You think it’s safe to eat this Tiny\nMushroom I found on the ground?
Lately, I’ve been finding that people’s Pokémon\nwill answer the door to take deliveries from me.
To understand yourself, you\nneed to talk to other people.
When you’ve shared countless battles with your\nPokémon, you start to intuit which moves they’d\r\nmost like to use.
A few years ago now, I learned a roller-skating\ntrick called the drift-and-dash from someone in\r\nVert Plaza.
Lumiose is a marvelous city, but the journey to\nget here also had some amazing moments.
Taking the long way round makes\nlife feel nice and unhurried.
I love my Pokémon and my car—\nI take great care of them both!
Maybe it’s because Pokémon can’t engage you in\nfriendly conversation, but a taxi driver can?
You gotta wonder... Why do people take taxis\ninstead of riding around on Pokémon?
Finding yourself through\ntraveling isn’t a real thing.
This city is full of people...and\nnone of them are people I know!
If a police officer started waving her arms around\nand running off somewhere, folks would panic!\r\nWe need to stay calm no matter the situation.
Don’t be put off if someone starts talking to you.\nYou might just learn something good from them.
If a couple wants their love to last forever, they\nhave to put in the effort to keep the magic going!
Flowers that grow from cracks\nin concrete are such fighters!
How about a drink? [VAR BD0A(000A)]Text_icon1
I always make sure to carry\nat least a few Super Potions.
If my client wins our next battle,\nmy balance sheet takes a big hit...
[~ 448]
People start to lose their minds\nwhen they work too hard...
Try our signature treat! [VAR BD0A(000A)]Text_icon1
That dark, bitter manna...\c\nEspresso is the oil that keeps our gears running\nsmoothly!
Getting greedy makes you lose sight of what’s\nimportant. Simple is best, in my opinion.
We only get showers here in Kalos.\nThey pass before you know it.
I want to hear more about this\nSuper Lumiose Galette thing.
It seems Professor Sycamore and Trevor are in\nsome far-off region carrying out research.
Now hear me out here—if the holo-tech around\nthe wild zones were to suddenly stop working...\r\nwould wild Pokémon overrun the city?
If you hold onto the things you like and the things\nthat are important to you, the rest of life will sort\r\nitself out in the end.
What will happen to my\nPokémon when I’m gone?
So what if I’m lost? I never\nknow where I’m going in life!
I want to let my Pokémon out of\ntheir balls and pet them for ages.
I don’t care if jogging’s healthy for you. I just run\nbecause I feel like it!
If there’s something you want\nto try, just take the plunge!
I can never decide which Pokémon is my favorite,\nbut I’m real interested in Poison types.
I feel like you can get a pretty good idea of\nsomeone just by knowing their favorite Pokémon.
For me, Clauncher will always be king! My first\npartner Pokémon was a Clauncher.
Who orders...gallons of water...?\nI’m so beat... Hah...man...
I hear the Multi Trains in Unova\nare back up and running!
Hmm. But I don’t particularly want to make my\nPokémon stronger. I don’t know about this...
Want to trade with me? Pokémon you get in a\ntrade grow strong faster than others, you know!
How does Eevee evolve\ninto Sylveon again?
The more you learn, the more you realize how\nlittle we know! Take Pokémon for example—\r\nthey’re still mostly a mystery to us!
The Trainers you face will grow stronger and\nstronger as you climb the ranks of the Z-A Royale.\r\nI can’t wait to dive in!
The folks managing the bonus cards and other\nparts of the Z-A Royale must have access to a\r\ntremendous amount of funding.
I’d rather climb the ranks of\nthe SBC than the Z-A Royale.
If I were taller, I’d fool people into\nthinking I’m an alpha Pokémon!
Buildings with ghosts inside must have great\nhistorical value.
Surround yourself only with things\nyou love for a rosy, rather dull life.
I used to be a roller\nskater, but it was tough!
Maybe I should take my girlfriend\nout on a date to the Parfum Palace.
Didn’t Mega Evolution first start\nfar away in the Hoenn region?
Hrmm... Which ball should I get\nfrom the Poké Ball Boutique...?

I aim to be the kind of Trainer who can support\nPokémon that want to get stronger.
Practically everyone has a Pokémon now. Means\nyou’ve gotta step up your game to get noticed.
It’s rough living out of a hotel for a long time, so\nI want to pick a nice one. But those nightly rates\r\nat Hotel Richissime are no joke...
I’m so glad I have my Pokémon. My life would be\nempty without them.
That way of talking is quite popular these days.
I watched one of those Canari videos. My word,\nwhat a sharp tongue!
The Rouge District feels like the true crème de la\ncrème of Lumiose, wouldn’t you say?
I’m searching for stragglers from a no-good\norganization called Team Flare.
Once I win the Z-A Royale, I’ll make everyone in\nthis city wear a furisode like me!
I’m very particular about my jogging shoes.\nFashion starts from the feet, you know!
Sir, please refrain from\nbodybuilding out here.
But how else am I gonna\nget as buff as Machoke?
This city’s like a maze at night,\nso I stick to daytime deliveries.
All you gotta do in the Z-A\nRoyale is win, win, win!
Wonder if we could\nget Mega Rings...
It’s too darn hard for kids\nto join the Z-A Royale!
Fifty years isn’t that old for\na building in Lumiose! [VAR BD0A(000A)]Text_icon1
Pain au chocolat?\nOr chocolatine?
I wonder who decided what\neach flower symbolizes... [VAR BD0A(000A)]Text_icon1
I think some Pokémon have\nbeen snacking on my wares... [VAR BD0A(000A)]Text_icon1
I wonder which flowers are the\nmost popular among Pokémon. [VAR BD0A(000A)]Text_icon1
Tell people you appreciate\nthem before they’re gone. [VAR BD0A(000A)]Text_icon1
You can withstand any hardship\nas long as you have some bread!
A lot more people are buying fruit\nfor their Pokémon these days. [VAR BD0A(000A)]Text_icon1
If Florges had a favorite flower\nshop, it would be this one! [VAR BD0A(000A)]Text_icon1
One of my regulars has a\nleft-handed Pokémon. [VAR BD0A(000A)]Text_icon1
It’s said Kalos’s history spans\nover three thousand years! [VAR BD0A(000A)]Text_icon1
I’m going to bake bread that\nevery Pokémon will want to try.
Crêpes came from\ngalettes, you know. [VAR BD0A(000A)]Text_icon1
Flowers wither as\nsoon as they bloom... [VAR BD0A(000A)]Text_icon1
Do Pokémon make their own\ntrails in Lumiose City, I wonder?
It must be so comfy\ninside a Poké Ball!
Surely Pokémon like being\nby their Trainer’s side best!
Can I let you in on a little secret? The truth is that\nI’m the strongest Trainer in town...\c\nBut I don’t battle, so no one will ever know!
[~ 34]
I’m not fussed about exchanging my Mega\nShards, but I do like collecting them.
If you can’t give 100 percent during practice, how\ncan you expect to give 110 percent in a battle?
I tell my Pokémon all the\nthings I can’t say to her.
In the end, we hash things\nout through Pokémon battles.
Some things are the right thing to\ndo, even if they’re not normal.
I’ll knock out a ton of Mable’s\nresearch tasks while I sightsee!
TMs can’t be used\non people...right?
I bring my best Pokémon with me so everyone will\nknow what a big shot I am.
That way of thinking only reveals just how small-\nminded he is.
I wanna be Detective Emma’s apprentice.
We could be the Lumiose Junior Detectives!
That Espurr, Mimi, won’t make it easy, though...
I don’t have time to waste on\nthings I don’t want to do!
The folks living here always\norder the same things.
We eat and drink, then battle\nour ideas and our Pokémon.
Living in this city could get difficult for folks who\ndon’t like Pokémon.
I’m on litter pickup duty every\nday. Rust Syndicate’s orders.
[~ 52]
So a “passage” over here\nmeans a shopping mall?
If I put clothes on my Fire-type\nPokémon, would they burn off?
The Rouge District passage has the best selection\nwhen it comes to clothing!
Buying out the whole store is an option, but then\nI’d still have to choose what to wear.
I’m shopping for clothes that will complement\nmy Pokémon when we go out strolling together.
I’m here looking for clothes that will make me\nlook like a tougher opponent.
Perhaps I’ll go with a simple silhouette and dress\nit up with accessories.
Everyone’s got secrets.\nPokémon and people, too.
Even if you don’t need anything,\nit’s fun going around the shops.
It’s hard to pick clothes that’ll\nlook good on others, isn’t it?
I want to get my Pokémon\nsomething cute to wear.
Online shoppers depend on folks\nlike us to bring fashion to them!
With so many options, it’s hard to know what\nwould look good on me...
I’m looking for inconspicuous clothing to wear for\nthe Z-A Royale.
After countless Z-A Royale losses, I’ve decided to\ntreat myself to some retail therapy.
Seriously?! I can’t believe I got\nleft behind in this battle zone...
[~ 69]
My big sis is so close with her Pokémon.\nHonestly, I’m pretty jealous...
It’s natural to grow close to your Pokémon when\nyou sit on a bench and hang out with them.
I play the kindly old man by day, but I show my\ntrue face at night as a Trainer in the Z-A Royale!
While making deliveries, I try to pick up feathers\nand stuff on the ground to keep Lumiose pristine.
I can’t throw a battle, no matter what’s at stake!\nClient, business partner—it doesn’t matter!
For our next destination, how about heading to\nGalar to do some Dynamaxing?
Nice idea! We can go\nto the Battle Tower!
When I’m given two options,\nI always want to choose both.
I still go out and catch Pokémon—\nmy age is no good reason not to!
The rooftops on either side of us are a bit higher\nthan here...but anyone can climb up to ’em!\c\nAll you gotta do is hold [VAR BD0A(0007)]Stick_L in the direction you\nwanna go!
Hey, you climbed up to that rooftop no problem!\nMy bro’s a parkour pro—I bet he was impressed!
Climb on up here! [VAR BD0A(000A)]Text_icon1
I saw how nimble you were, climbing up here...\nExtraordinary! I can tell you’re something special!\c\nThanks for showing me some great climbing.\nHere, take these as a little show of appreciation!
The trick to climbing up onto more rooftops is to\nmake your way through the scaffolding courses!
[~ 84]
There’s too much tasty food here!\nI dunno if I’ll ever leave Lumiose!
We tend to pick our favorite\nPokémon to be our partners.
Do you ever wonder if the Berries found on the\nground all over town are leftovers from Pokémon?
I saw a video of this special curry they serve at\nHotel Z that looks totally insane.
People only ever come talk to me\nbecause they like my Pokémon.
If you’re here for a battle, I’ll have to pass. I don’t\nwanna mess up my partner’s fur.
The better the people and Pokémon in a town are\ndoing, the more interesting it is to stroll around.
Just having my Pokémon\naround me lifts my spirits!
Scraping by on Pokémon\nbattling alone is a tough life.
I always just panic and throw the first ball I grab,\nso I keep on using regular old Poké Balls.
I’ve been working on my dashing so I can always\noutrun Pokémon!
Diantha’s debut performance on the silver screen\nas a young girl was truly wonderful.
To be seen as refined, one must dine in a refined\nmanner and speak with a refined vocabulary.
Is it safe to try petting\nPoison-type Pokémon?
Aw, gotta find another way to\nschool ’cause of Pokémon...
One day, I’m gonna become a\nTrainer worthy of my Pokémon!
Maybe the reason Pokémon can’t use a move as\nsoon as they’re sent into battle is because they\r\nneed a moment to check their surroundings.
I wonder if the different kinds of Poké Balls are\nmore or less comfortable for Pokémon to be in?
[~ 103]
Do you think wild Pokémon\never hope they’ll get caught?
I go jogging to explore the city and look for spots\nthat I can use to my advantage in the Z-A Royale.
Why not just go\nright in and ask?
I’ll check my Rotom Phone to see\nif we can make a reservation here.
Looking up all the time just makes my neck hurt.\c\nThough looking to the side makes me wonder if\nI’m falling behind my peers...
Sometimes forfeiting is the\nright call in the Z-A Royale.
Certain Pokémon only\nappear at night, of course.
Detective Emma is incredible.\nHow does she do all of that?
Lumiose is in the center of Kalos\nand has a tower at its own center.
The Lumiose Gang is\nalways there for Emma!
Emma’s partner can use\nsome crazy cool telepathy!
Another day of being woken by\na Pokémon move to the face...
I’m a member of the Pokédex Research Society.\nIf I could write Helioptile’s Pokédex entry, I’d say:\c\n“Since Helioptile can change light from the sun\ninto electrical energy, it can function just fine\r\neven without eating food.”
I heard once that Ivor lost to a certain girl when\nhe was young. Apparently that defeat is what led\r\nhim to start learning martial arts.
What kinds of dreams do you think our Pokémon\nhave, all tucked away in their Poké Balls?
We couriers train our partner Pokémon so we can\nprotect our deliveries while we’re out and about!
I’m a warrior on a journey of growth, traveling the\nworld in the guise of a common tourist.
We’ve visited many different places in our travels.\nAnd mostly just lost to many different Trainers...
Watching videos of others battling\nis a good way to learn the basics.
I lost to my Pokémon\nin an eating contest!
Do you think Pokémon remember their own\nEvolution?
Whether it’s in art or in Pokémon battles, we all\nstart out as novices.
Emma’s mentor was a detective\nwho went by the name of Looker.
[~ 127]
The Rock type is strong against Fire types, right?
The Fire type is strong against Steel types.
And the Steel type is strong against Rock types...\nIt’s vital that you build yourself a balanced team!
I don’t actually like to join battles,\nbut I sure do like watching them!
I just can’t catch up with some\nof these Trainers who go all out.
My favorite type is the good ol’\nNormal type! So few weaknesses!
Ground types may have a lot of\nweaknesses, but I like them best.
Meditite gives off megapowerful vibes, right?
More like meditative vibes, no?
I love dishes with Slowpoke tail!\nIt’s really sweet—did you know?
Cheese made from Skiddo\nmilk is suuuper yummy!
I heard Emma was mentored by an\nofficer of the International Police.
There’s a kid in my class\nbattling in the Z-A Royale!
Lock on, and then go on the attack!\c\nThrow a ball as soon as that catch window opens!\c\nIt’s helpful to imagine it all playing out in your\nhead before doing the real thing, right?
Messing about in wild zones may be fine for you,\nbut are you sure your Pokémon feel the same?
I know there are things to be gained from defeat...\c\nBut I still don’t want to lose to another Trainer!\nAnd I don’t want to see my Pokémon lose either!
How can I win?\nIs it all about levels?!
And what’s a\n“base point”?
All you need to get strong is to\nkeep on loving your Pokémon!
Do you hafta know\nthe popular moves?
Have you ever seen the exact moment a Mega\nCrystal forms?
What’re those Mega Crystals even made of?
Growing up alongside Pokémon...\nIt’s not as common as you’d think.
My partner Pokémon’s been in\nmy family longer than I have!
I’d like to set up some classrooms\nwhere we can send out Pokémon...
The poor Pokémon are stuck\nin their balls all schoolday!
But if we sent ’em out,\nI’d just wanna battle.
I’ve got my Pokémon with me! And I’m one of the\nstrongest in my class!
I’m not letting you walk back home alone until\nyou can defeat me in a battle.
I’ve got after-school activities with\nmy Pokémon once I get home.
Pokémon battles are all I\nthink about, day or night.
Pokémon are life, that’s for sure.\nBut life’s also full of surprises.
I think I know what you mean—\nbut I’m also pretty sure I don’t.
[~ 161]

Hard bread! Get your\nreal hard bread here!
I wanna eat everything! Please, please, can’t I\nhave some more pocket money?
I suppose so, since we’re here to shop anyway.\nBut get something for your Pokémon too!
Please have a look! [VAR BD0A(000A)]Text_icon1
I simply adore une\nmarché traditionnel!
I travel all around the world’s regions and write\nup posts on the great food I find in each.
Do you call the end of a baguette “le croûton” or\n“le quignon”? My friend and I can’t agree!
They’re delicious!
My job’s to gently shoo away the Pokémon that\ncome sniffing around for something to eat.
Even if the Pokémon I shoo away keep coming\nback, I just gently shoo them away again.
The only thing that’s changed recently that I can\nthink of is all this “urban redevelopment” bunk...
Lumiose is surrounded by so much nature! Why\ndo these Pokémon keep gathering in our streets?
When I send out my partner Pokémon, wild\nPokémon are more likely to react...\c\nBut that also means they’re more likely to attack\nmy partner...
I wanna play tag using all of Lumiose City as the\nbounds! Whaddya say?!
Maybe Pokémon are also gathering here in\nLumiose to decide who’s the strongest?
An increase in wild Pokémon...and Mega Stones\nyet to be discovered...
[~ 180]
A graveyard is really not so different from a park.\c\nIt’s probably a fine place to relax a bit as long as\nyou keep an eye out for wild Pokémon attacks.
You can spend time with the spirits of departed\nPokémon and people at graveyards.
With so many Pokémon about, I suppose the\npeople at rest here mustn’t feel lonely.
Here, I can converse with those\nwhose memories live on in me.
For some reason, visiting graveyards perks me\nright up...which is SO out of character for me!
There are some Pokémon that make their habitat\nin graveyards.\c\nCan’t say I know what they like so much about\nthis kind of atmosphere.
[~ 187]
How do they know which move\nto use just by hearing the name?
If Pokémon make a mess in the\ncity, do they have to clean it up?
It’s so satisfying smashing a\nbunch of Mega Crystals in a row!
It really bugs me how some people\nare bugged by Pokémon smells.
I’ve been taking food into the wild zones to feed\nthe Pokémon there.\c\nI don’t want them to have to steal from people.
I happen to be with the Pokédex Research\nSociety. If I could write an entry for Whirlipede...\c\n“They are often seen stationary because they are\npreserving their energy for Evolution. But upon\r\nspotting prey, they will spin furiously toward the\r\nprey to do battle.” Yes, that’s what I’d write.
My five different colored Flabébé are what get me\nthrough the day. I wonder if they feel the same...
What do alphas eat\nto get so darn big?
Have you noticed how really big\nMega Crystals form on rooftops?
I know my Pokémon love me\nbecause they stay by my side.
It’s best not to assume\nthings that are unsaid.
What kinda place d’you think Pokémon like to\nlive in?
I guess someplace where they have enough to\neat, a safe place to sleep...and people nearby?
I actually like those Hotel Z promo\nvideos, but no one else seems to...
Today I’ve gotta work with the guy\nI battled in last night’s Royale?!
Don’t you feel awfully low when a party ends?\nThe cure for that is to hold another party!
Everything that lives must die. It’s an immutable\nrule—and straying from it can only bring pain.
[~ 205]
You see that? Those Pokémon way up in the sky\nhave been watching us this whole time!
M-maybe...they think this is their territory, and\nwe’re encroaching on it?
Don’t you think we should just let the Pokémon\nrun free here in the plazas? I mean, why not?
If you go to all five plazas,\nsomething good happens!
That sounds\ntotally bogus.
I guess you’ll register\nmore travel spots...
What do people mean when they say they want to\nlive with Pokémon? After all, people are so weak!
You can get around faster if you cut straight\nthrough the plaza.
I’m here to observe wild\nPokémon in the plaza!
Wild Pokémon are kind of scary,\nbut I still want to see ’em up close.
There’s no way anyone could\nhave a bad time with Pokémon!
It’s all the same, whether I’m\nhaving a good time or bad.
The more you run, the closer\nyou get to your final goal.
Someone I know told me that if you catch all the\nPokémon that appear in that wild zone once,\r\nthen some outrageous Pokémon will appear.
They just have to be strong enough to battle at\nyour side reliably.
Well, there’s certainly no Pokémon out there\nstrong enough to be truly invincible.
What’s it mean for a\nPokémon to be strong?
How strong a partner would\nI need to really feel safe?
If it’s way too strong,\nit won’t listen to you.
Lumiose is a constant delight.\nIt never stops changing, does it?
What kind of Pokémon should I get for my first\npartner?
You shouldn’t listen to other people’s ideas. Fate\nwill lead you to the right Pokémon.
I wonder how many Pokémon\nthere are living in Lumiose?
No one ever truly knows\nwhat the future will bring.
Pokémon sure have it good.\nI wish I could use moves too.
[~ 231]
Oh, you know how it is! Here in\nLumiose we just love to gab!
Looks like I’m going to lose\nanother whole day chatting.
Part of our duty is cleaning up\ndamage from wild Pokémon.
I started raising a Venipede of my own because I\nwanna be as cool as Corbeau someday!
I wonder if my sweet Furfrou should go for a\nLa Reine Trim next time?
Getting slapped with Buneary’s ears stings so bad\nit’ll make you cry.
[~ 238]
When someone springs a battle on you in the Z-A\nRoyale, it’s so surprising you freeze up for a sec!
I’ve got an autograph from the famous Rhyhorn\nracer Grace!
Know how you seem to see couriers that look like\nme all over the place? It’s actually always just me!
I came all the way to Lumiose,\nso tell me where the locals eat!
But I don’t want my favorite spots\nto all get overrun by tourists...
I wonder what would happen if every Trainer in\nLumiose sent out their Pokémon at once.
Boy, if I could get away with it, I’d love to go\nracing down this street on a Rhyhorn...
[~ 246]
I wonder if Pokémon also feel more at ease if their\nTrainers stay close to them in battle...
I’m a member of the Pokédex Research Society. If\nI could do my own entry for Fletchinder, I’d say...\c\n“It scatters sparks from its beak to set grass\naflame. When bug Pokémon come leaping out\r\nin a panic, it swoops down upon them.”
I used to be able to pick up all kinds of part-time\nwork at Hotel Richissime.\c\nTaking room service orders, making beds, finding\nlost items... It was tough!
Remember, my young friend:\ncomparison is the thief of joy.
I can feel my Pokémon jostling in\ntheir balls when it’s time to battle!
I can’t afford a stay at Richissime,\nbut I can take a selfie in front of it!
Knowing how to dodge\nincoming attacks is vital!
When a Pokémon uses Dig, how\ndoes it know where to surface?
I saw a Pokémon with glowing eyes when I went\nup to the rooftops. I was out of there like a shot!
I imagine it’s the Pokémon themselves who feel\nmost unnerved by being here in our city.
Whenever I find people laid out by wild Pokémon,\nI haul ’em over to a nearby Pokémon Center.
What a broad street! So how about\ngiving me some breathing space?
I wanna see Pokémon\nall playing together!
Anybody else remember using\nPidgey Mail way back when?
I love my old apartment, but\nI’d love an elevator even more...
They say the portions are as small as they are so\nthat you can focus on the flavors. But I just feel\r\nlike I’m getting ripped off!
Oh, just let it go already, would you! We’ll find a\nshop that has great flavor and great portions!
I couldn’t sleep a wink with\nSpewpa snoring away all night!
I’m nothing like the furisode\ngirls you might find in Johto.
I wanna try a Poké Puff too!\nAfter all, Pokémon love them!
[~ 267]
The Lumiose Museum is doing a\nspecial exhibition about Hisui!
Just seeing the Lumiose Museum\nfrom the outside is enough for me!
Come on, even if we don’t get the\nart, we should at least go inside!
I requested permission to sketch a\ncopy of “Golurk and the Knight.”
Roselia’s blooms give off an aroma with a lovely\nrelaxing effect.
That curved roof on the museum... Am I the only\none who thinks it just looks like a giant slide?
I know my Rotom Phone should catch me, but I’m\nstill too scared to cross that narrow scaffolding...
Pokémon learned a new move?\nGo ahead and give it a try!
I just want to beat that Trainer and\nhis darn Pokémon before I go.
The Lumiose Society of Battle Connoisseurs...\nQuite intimidating to approach, aren’t they?
You should frequently take stock of the moves\navailable for your Pokémon to use.
I just like to wander the streets\nand leave my office far behind.
If Pokémon do my work for me,\nthen do they get my salary?
Whatever people say, the SBC isn’t just some rich\nkid club—we’re here to make Lumiose better!
Lady Jacinthe’s grand aspiration is a beautiful\nharmony between people and Pokémon.\c\nShe takes on the mantle of leader only so she can\nhelp guide the city toward a better future.
There’s nothing I enjoy more than\npartying with my Pokémon party!
Lady Jacinthe scolds us terribly if\nwe lose due to careless blunders.
Lebanne must always\nhave her hands full...
I’ve heard some people say Lady Jacinthe wants\nto have all the Clefable for herself!
The holo-tech they use to enclose\nwild zones is really something.
The SBC Trainers are frightfully strong, even if it’s\nthanks to constantly fighting among themselves.
If we have to, my Pokémon and\nme will protect my grandma!
Just like parents, Trainers mustn’t\nstifle their Pokémon’s freedom.
I’ve memorized a bunch\nof people’s names! [VAR BD0A(000A)]Text_icon1

You gotta hide so wild\nPokémon don’t spot you.
I wanna catch a Pokémon!\nGot any tips for me?
Isn’t it cute when Pokémon\nperch on streetlights?
The Number One Committee is in session! Today’s\ntopic: What’s the strongest Pokémon in Lumiose?
The same Pokémon can be stronger or weaker\ndepending on the Trainer, right?
Maybe the strongest Pokémon’s the one that the\nbest Trainer in the Z-A Royale uses most?
Nice of the Pokémon Center\nto celebrate my birthday!
I’m happy to talk, but can we\ndo it somewhere more level?
We’re trying to track down a group that uses\nPokémon to do bad stuff. Seen anything fishy?
Pokémon belong at their Trainer’s side, and\nTrainers belong at their Pokémon’s side.
Some people age like good cheese!\nBut most age like...bad cheese.
You don’t see many apartment\nbuildings with elevators here.
I’m really good with numbers!\nBut only if they’re about Pokémon.
[~ 13]
Look at the nice view you get from up here! Even\nPokémon come to see it sometimes.
Tarragon might be a bit\ntoo into his scaffolding.
My Pokémon respect me as their Trainer! That’s\nmy proof I’m a good person.
I wonder if that young Gym Leader\nhas been inventing anything new...
Even losing just once can\nbring you down for a long time.
Between all the urban redevelopment work and\nthe Z-A Royale, things never settle down here.
Those cards you get in the Z-A\nRoyale are holo-tech, I hear!
Our family really can’t handle\nkeeping any more Pokémon.
Please, I really want this\nPokémon! It’s just one more!
Y’know something? Rest is\nmore important than work.
Why’s some foreign company being trusted\nwith a big deal like redeveloping Lumiose?
If we could speak with our Pokémon, I wonder if\nwe’d grow closer with them or end up fighting.
You were the one who challenged\nme to a battle way back then, love.
No, no—you challenged me!\nAnd I fell for you when you won!
Someday this scaffolding all over Lumiose will go\naway and we’ll forget it ever existed.
[~ 29]
Chilling with my\nPokémon is the best!
Pay attention to how big an area a move can hit!\nYou might think of some new battle ideas.
There’s so many things I wanna do together with\nmy Pokémon. I wish I could live forever!
I wonder if I’ll live long enough to make friends\nwith all the Pokémon in the world...
I want to try and battle all the strongest Trainers\nin every last region there is!
Whether I’m productive or manage\nnothing at all, the days slip on by...
If you have a Pokémon, then every\nday is one shared with a partner!
Gah! No matter where I go,\nI can’t escape my work!
All you actually have to do to be\nan artist is declare yourself one.
I want to collect Kurt’s Poké Balls\nand put them on display together!
I’m planning to do my own\nTreasure Hunt in Lumiose!
[~ 41]
Folks here sure do talk\nto themselves a lot.
If I keep battling, I’m\nbound to win sometime!
When Meowstic’s ears unfold, it...it... Aaagh!\nI get the heebie-jeebies just thinking about it!
They say DYN4MO got started when people from\nRacine Construction formed a group to act as\r\nbodyguards for Canari.
I can only hold it together\nthanks to my Pokémon!
If I’m upset, giving my partner’s\nPoké Ball a little squeeze helps.
It’s hard to keep winning forever. Even the\n“unbeatable” Leon was eventually defeated.
I bet it’d be fun to have some kinda contest to\nfind each district’s strongest grade-schooler!
If I hope to understand how my Pokémon feel in\nbattle, first I’ve got to train and do battle myself!
“One must never stop reflecting.” That’s what my\nmaster always used to say.
Let’s play office!
OK, then I’ll be the\none who gets paid!
Even if I win today,\nI may lose tomorrow.
[~ 55]
Let’s find lots of hidden treasure here in Lumiose\nso we can make our fortune!
Treasure? You mean those Mega Stones? It’s true\nthat they do seem to be found all over lately.
I heard those Quasartico people have been findin’\nMega Stones during their construction work.
Whenever your Pokémon evolve, don’t forget to\ncheck whether they’ve learned any new moves.
You can have your Pokémon learn moves of just\none type or a wide variety—it’s totally up to you.
You only live once, whether\nyou’re a person or a Pokémon!
Every café has its\nown specialty. [VAR BD0A(000A)]Text_icon1
All these winding little streets...\nLumiose sure ain’t made for cars.
I’m completely beat... I wish\nI could rest in a Poké Ball...
I simply spent my life enjoying every day to the\nfullest, and before I knew it, I’d reached this age.
I know! Enjoying time with my friends and my\nPokémon caused me to evolve into an old woman!
Picking the right bonus cards is key if you want to\nwin in the Z-A Royale.
Teach your Pokémon plenty of different moves,\nand you’ll be able to use any kind of bonus card.
Look, bonus cards are all well and good, but I’d\nfocus on getting in those surprise attacks!
My Staryu fell down from space!
Hmph, gotta stop thinking...\nCrud! That’s a thought, too...
Whenever I meet a new Pokémon, I’m just like\n“AHHH!” and “NO WAY!” and “GYAAAH!” Y’know?
I wonder what Pokémon we might meet just by\nwandering around the city?
When my grampa died,\nhe left me his Garchomp.
W-wow, really?\nWill it listen to you?
“I’m gonna Overheat on life!”\nNo? Hm, catchphrases are tough.
Do you think Pokémon enjoy the alone time they\nget inside their Poké Balls?
When I got so sick I could hardly move, my sweet\nAudino took such good care of me.
I get the feeling way more rocks and brambles\nand things are appearing around town.\c\nIt’s getting to the point that you can hardly walk\nthe streets...
Well, they’re hardly insurmountable. Just have\nyour Pokémon use a move to clear them away.
This rooftop here is where\nme and Krokorok camp out.
Don’t let others’ moods hold sway\nover your own. They come and go.
Boy, every single place we’ve\nvisited so far has been great.
And every place we’ve got\ncoming up looks great too!
I tried eating a Berry that my\nPokémon was holding. Bad idea.
A nice swig of fresh water can\neven make Pokémon feel better!
Oh, Pichu, you blessed thing.\nShocked yourself again, did you?
Just because the Z-A Royale exists doesn’t mean\nall us adults are aiming to be the strongest.
Just like there are all kinds of Pokémon, there are\nall kinds of things you can do when you grow up.
Is it tough to be a grown-up if you’re not good at\nbattling?
[~ 91]
A lifetime wouldn’t be enough\nto truly master Pokémon battles.
I don’t care how weak\nit might be! I still love it!
Numel takes quadruple damage\nfrom Water-type moves, right?
I got some e-books on sale...\nStill haven’t read ’em, though.
How about a little competition to see who can\ncatch the biggest Pokémon?
I’m game, as long as you don’t care about how\nbig of a mess they’ll make in our tiny apartment.
I’ve just gotta get an alpha! That’s my ticket to\ntotal victory!
OK, so base points are...\nNope! I still don’t get it!
I think...more base points\nmeans you get higher stats?
I’ll tell you the truth, but only you. If you go\naround to every one of Lumiose’s plazas in turn...\r\nnothing at all will happen...
I think I’m finally getting used to the smell of all\nthe Pokémon around here.\c\nIt’s weird, but now I sort of feel reassured when I\nget a nice, strong whiff of them.
Perhaps someday people will fight directly against\nPokémon.
If a thing can be fixed, it’s worth thinking about.\nBut if it’s not going to get fixed, simply let it go.
I want a suuuper cute Pokémon\nthat’s also shockingly strong!
I want a really cool-looking\nPokémon as my partner!
I bet they’d make bank if they\nbrought back Super Training now!
I’m a genius at drawing portraits\nthat look nothing like their subject.
That Lebanne lady is preeetty darn tough!
Some Trainers look like they’d be even scarier in a\nfight than their Pokémon!
I’d say that Ivor from the Fist of Justice would be\na prime example.
Tyranitar and Excadrill, no doubt.\nI had the BEST Sandstorm team.
What Pokémon were your\nfavorite when you were young?
If only I had an undefeatable\nPokémon. I’d never worry then!
Imagine if all the Pokémon went\nwild and attacked at once... Scary!
I saw this squishy green...well,\nsomething when I was in Alola.
Do you think maybe\nit was a Pokémon?
Aren’t there any apps that list up\nall the moves a Pokémon learns?
My long years of experience have\nleft me peerless in the Z-A Royale.
Maybe I should start stunning my\ntargets with unexpected moves.
Geez, am I ever sick of getting dragged into\nPokémon battles when I’m trying to do my job!\c\nHave you been hearing the same from the other\ncouriers you meet?
As the Zen masters try to teach us, “Every day is a\ngood day if you make it so.” I want to make it so.
The number of wild Pokémon keeps on increasing\nin this city. Doesn’t that seem strange to you?\c\nAnd yet everyone’s acting like it’s a great thing!\nAre they all just off their rockers or what?
I buy the finest ingredients for my Pokémon’s\nmeals, but they’re the ones that do the cooking.
What kind of items do you have your Pokémon\nhold? I suppose Berries are tried-and-true...
You don’t have to battle in order\nto enjoy time with your Pokémon!
Now that there are more Pokémon around, we’ve\ngotta cover even more kinds of Pokémon in class!
How do TMs\nactually work?
Some kids even memorize\nall the Pokédex numbers!
It’s important to think about\nhow far away a move can hit!
The Jaune District has a lot\nmore stairs than other areas.
I’m not getting anywhere\nwith filling my Pokédex!
Do you think the Pokémon I’ve\nsent to my Boxes are all right?
Feelings can’t be seen by anyone.\nYou’ve got to put them into words.
Vive le mode photo!\nI just love it! [VAR BD0A(000A)]Text_icon1
[~ 136]
They say that Absol is a Pokémon that can live an\nincredibly long time—like one hundred years long!
You need a special stone to evolve a Clefairy. Did\nyou know that?
People seem to get it in their head\nthat coffee will wake them up.
The city, people, Pokémon...\nEverything keeps changing.
I’m conducting research on how\nthe weather affects drink sales.
Oh, well, I simply apprenticed under a Pokémon\nProfessor by the name of Rowan long ago.
My gram-gram knows all about Pokémon! She\nteaches me about every last one we see in town.
I’ve been training here in secret to improve my\nrank in the Z-A Royale.
I forget—how tall\nis Prism Tower?
I think it was...nearly\none thousand feet?
If people could become as strong as Pokémon,\nI might not feel so uneasy living alongside them.\r\nBut I suppose that’s too much to ask, huh?
Well, they say might makes right, after all!\c\nI don’t think it’s a bad thing to do a little training\nso you can defend yourself from Pokémon.
I want to go train in the wild!\nStupid wild zones don’t count!
I’m a ninth-degree black belt\nin Pokémon! I just forgot my gi.
I just want to be as strong as Ivor-sensei!
Ivor-sensei may be strong, but he’s not invincible!
Doing martial arts helps me\nunderstand my Pokémon!
Trainers should know the\npain their Pokémon face.
This is the Justice Dojo, training grounds for the\nFist of Justice.
Plus Moves\nare the best!
Seeds of mastery!\nI’ve gotta get some!
Pokémon are terrifying creatures.
I’m gonna take down the Fist of Justice! Then I’ll\nbe known far and wide as Lumiose’s strongest!
If you can master our Justice Punch technique,\nyou should be able to pulverize all sorts of things![VAR 0114(0011)]
I love the serenity of a quiet night...but I also love\nthe Z-A Royale.[VAR 0114(0012)]
It’s great how training lets me\nchange myself for the better!
Ghost types grow more powerful\nat night...at least, I think they do.
It’s so exciting to\npull an all-nighter!
Ivor-sensei’s rigid might... Gwynn’s light touch\nand adaptability... They make a balanced team!
There are cardboard boxes stuffed haphazardly\nwith Fist of Justice equipment.
These Trevenant-themed training dummies are\nhandy for practicing strikes and kicks.
It’s an incline bench for doing sit-ups. A note on\nit says “Off-limits for Ivor!” in small writing.
It’s a flag for the Fist of Justice with their logo\nprinted on it—almost like the Team MZ flag.
It’s a sandbag for practicing strikes. A note on it\nsays “Off-limits for Ivor!” in small writing.
[~ 171]
What’d happen if the holo-tech\naround the wild zones ever broke?
Your Pokémon are really fantastic.\nThey must love you raising them.
You sure are giving my Pokémon\nan uncanny amount of attention...
I like buildings that face\nout onto a Y junction.
If wild Pokémon never attacked innocent\nbystanders, we wouldn’t need wild zones.
I get lonely sleeping by myself when I’m traveling,\nso I always let my partner out of its Poké Ball.
Sableye is pretty unusual for having the Fairy type\nas its only weakness.
The floor above my place is vacant,\nyet I keep hearing this odd noise...
Maybe a Pokémon found a way\nin and made itself at home?
If a Magikarp came flopping out,\nI’d toss it right back in the river!
[~ 182]
This old wives’ tale says that a Sharpedo tooth\nwill protect you from ever getting shipwrecked.
My Delibird sometimes gives me bug Pokémon as\nlittle presents...
At some point while I was training Machop, I\nrealized that I love martial arts as well!
Your first-ever partner is\na pretty big choice, huh?
The Pokémon battles in that\nrestaurant had a real kick.
Furisode take a whole lot of work!\nBut they’re still all I want to wear!
Simply putting on a pair of specs\nwon’t help you see the truth.
I reckon even Pokémon must be taken by surprise\nwhen the weather suddenly changes.
I want to make it snow for my Ice-type Pokémon\non superhot summer days!
Now that there are more Pokémon around, I hope\nwe’ll see even more mysterious things happen!
When night falls, my Lampent...\npulls double duty as my lamp.
Ending each day grooming my\nPokémon is all I could ever want.
Humans could learn a thing or two from Pokémon\nabout communication. We’re always running our\r\nmouths when we should stick to the essentials.
Think of a type that your first Pokémon is weak to,\nthen get a Pokémon strong against that type.\c\nNext, identify one of that Pokémon’s weaknesses\nand get a third Pokémon to counter it, and so on.\r\nThat’s the real trick to building up your party.
How come we can’t just send packages to people\nthe same way we send Pokémon to Boxes?
La fin justifie les moyens.
Me and Buneary’s dream is\nto pull off Mega Evolution!
I’ve got to recapture the wonder\nfrom when I first became a Trainer.
Be their playmate\nforever and ever!
What should I do to make\nmy Pokémon happy?
I’ll give your Furfrou\na real stylish trim! [VAR BD0A(000A)]Text_icon1
[~ 204]
Those heated gazes in the Z-A Royale... They reek\nof danger.
People ride on Pokémon in some\nregions but not others. It’s tricky.
Get lost on purpose!\nYou’ll discover new things.
If one person loses something,\nanother person gets to find it.
Ahhh, I can’t wait to eat.\nI’m gonna stuff my face!
The city smells different now after it rains. Is it\nsomething to do with all the new Pokémon?
Even if you don’t know the first thing about art,\nanyone’s free to say what they do or don’t like.
I wonder if my first-ever Pokémon\nwill be with me to the very end.
I dress like this to match how\nsplendid my Pokémon are.
People can’t help showing off how\nhigh-level their Pokémon is.
Remember, you’re free to do—\nor not do—whatever you want!
Officer, you WILL be able to find my stolen\nbelongings, won’t you?
Our search Pokémon have a keen sense of smell,\nbut there’s a decent chance that a wild Pokémon\r\nalready made off with the missing property.
The four of us are gonna\nget strong with Pokémon!
We’re gonna be the\nElite Four someday!
Ugh, how’d I get\ndragged into this...
But you two both\nlike the same type!
This life is too much some days...\nI need my Pokémon to comfort me.
Think I’ll get my 15 minutes of\nfame through the Z-A Royale?
Gramps... I’ve never even seen\nyou stay up past nine o’clock!
I like Pokémon battles, and yet the minute one\nstarts up, I feel so awfully stressed...
I’m not sure I want to hear that from someone\nwho joins the Z-A Royale with a smile every night.
I can’t get a wink of sleep after losing a battle.\nAnd on the nights when I win my battles...?\c\nWell, I can’t sleep, because I’m too pumped up!
It’s fun to grab a taxi just to hear the stories the\ndrivers have to tell.
I’m real strong in Pokémon battles!\nI’m just also real weak in business!
It always seems to be one thing\nafter another in Lumiose City...
What should I play\nwith my Pidgey?
I wish I could just manage a\nnatural smile in front of her...
How may couriers would you say you’ve met since\nyou arrived in Lumiose City?
I work to fund my hobby—and I live for my hobby!\c\nWhat’s my hobby, you ask? Why, strolling with my\nPokémon while eating tasty food!
Perhaps for my next holiday I’ll go over the\nmountains and visit the Paldea region.
It’s really just luck that I live such a good life. So\nmuch of it is thanks to the people around me.
I just told her about some\nmemories from my travels.
I’m fascinated by\ntales of Unova!
What a profound mystery it is...\nThe disappearance of O-Powers...
There sure are a lot of\nteams here in Lumiose.
I myself am a member\nof the Lumiose SBC.
I’m part of an occult fan club.\nThough I’m the only member...
I’ll win my way to the top of the Z-A Royale with\nmy Beldum, then I’ll revive the Pokémon Fan Club!
They have those Z-Move things in Alola, right?\nAnd Zygarde was there too...
Verily am I a member of the Pokédex Research\nSociety. If I could describe Carbink in an entry of\r\nmy own devising, I would write...\c\n“Carbink that sleep deep underground are forced\nby geological forces such as volcanic eruptions or\r\nearthquakes to rise to the surface, where they\r\nawaken from their slumber.”
[~ 246]
We were having a little game of naming 10 things\nwe each like about one another’s Pokémon.
Please, I was a member of the Pokémon Fan Club!\nI could easily name a hundred things!
It’s nice to take a little\nstroll around the hotel.
Bunnelby digs holes to hide\nfrom other Pokémon, you know.
Oh, Mom. It was just an overnight stay at the\nhospital. You’re not about to die tomorrow!
But your Drampa doesn’t like anybody but you,\nGrandma!
When I’m gone, can I count on you two to take\ncare of my partner for me?
Wait till I teach my\nPokémon that move!
You’re nowhere near\nready to beat me!
Boy, 100 for a Casteliacone\nwas such a great bargain!
Not letting your guard slip\nshows you respect an opponent.
I don’t know what’ll happen\nin the future, so why worry!
I lost over and over yesterday...\nbut I feel like today I might win.
We ventured into one\nof those wild zones...
Being swarmed by wild\nPokémon is truly frightful!
I guess I just go with whatever feels right when I\nfirst meet them...?
Do you find out what your Pokémon will evolve\ninto before you give them a nickname?
If you want to train your Pokémon, you won’t get\nfar unless you take on tough foes.
Just keep walking. Eventually\nyou’re sure to get somewhere.
I heard it cost 5,000,000 just to\njoin Team Flare back in the day.
Ahh, I can’t help but melt when\nI smell Victreebel’s sweet scent!
[~ 268]
I’m pretty sure I saw a Hawlucha-\nthemed manhole somewhere...
Me too! I’m sure I did!\nOr at least I think I did.
Catering to Pokémon as customers\ncould be a business opportunity...
I wonder if Pokémon settle in\nplaces people don’t tend to go. [VAR BD0A(000A)]Text_icon1
I’m a member of the Pokédex Research Society!\c\nIf I could write my own entry for Lairon, it’d say...\c\n“Lairon is super cool! And super hard! Because\nLairon eats up iron ore!”
It’s good to stay young at heart, but you also need\nto be able to act like an adult when you start\r\nraising Pokémon of your own.
Do you think some Pokémon let\nthemselves be caught on purpose?
I just love couriers!\nSo I dress up like one!
Starmie’s category is the Mysterious Pokémon!\c\nSeems kinda...dissatisfying, doesn’t it?
Everywhere I go becomes a splendid stage thanks\nto my dazzling presence!
[~ 279]
That summer I spent with my\nPokémon... Those days are gone.
Our complaints about all the\nredevelopment go nowhere.
Have you heard that the sewers connect to all\nkinds of different places in Lumiose?
Some of those sewers have been around for, like,\nforever...
But there are lots of Pokémon that live down in\nthe sewers! Only strong Trainers can face them.
I’m just enjoying an elegant moment here on the\nrooftop, buffeted by Pidgeotto’s moves.\c\nNothing to see here. Do carry on, commoner.
Look, different strokes for different folks and all,\nbut I think you’ll probably need a Pokémon Center\r\nif you keep on taking that many hits in a row...
The stronger the move you use,\nthe longer it will tend to take.
I have to win big in the Z-A Royale\nso I can afford my Pokémon’s food!
I don’t just deliver packages.\nI deliver wishes and feelings.
I’m hoping that martial arts will\nteach me how to quiet my mind.
Not everyone has an easy time\nwalking about—we still need cars!
If you like lots of things,\nyou enjoy lots of things!
I’ll put my name on my Poké Balls\nso the collectors see they’re mine.
All the redevelopment in the world isn’t going to\nbring back the people who have left Lumiose.
Yeah, the Trainer’s level of\nexperience is important, too!
Just ’cause someone has a strong\nteam doesn’t mean they’ll win.
What do you think an ideal meal would look like\nfor a Pokémon?
I suppose it would vary by species. You’d have to\nconsider their different dietary needs too.
What do you think a Pokémon\nwould consider an ideal meal?
[~ 300]
I wish my Pokémon could\nshare some vitality with me!
I’m gonna play with the Pokémon\nI’d been keeping in my Boxes! [VAR BD0A(000A)]Text_icon1
I still have my roller skates\ntucked away somewhere... [VAR BD0A(000A)]Text_icon1
The girls and I like to get together\nand brag about our Pokémon. [VAR BD0A(000A)]Text_icon1
If only I could sleep\nwhile standing up... [VAR BD0A(000A)]Text_icon1
What should I do for that Pokémon research\nassignment?
Maybe something about how they evolve?
See if you can find out why they can only\nremember four moves at a time?
How they can become small enough to fit into a\nPoké Ball?
Stealing travel bags is just the\nsort of mischief Pokémon like.
It’s easiest to appreciate a city\nlike Lumiose when you leave it.
Life’s all about listening to tunes\nI love and doing things I love. [VAR BD0A(000A)]Text_icon1
The only choice Pokémon have in battle is to trust\nin their Trainer and use the moves they’re told to.
Yes, I think it’s SO important to have a trusting\nrelationship with your Pokémon when battling!
With all this construction, all our\nworking Pokémon are pitching in!
Even a single lap around the\nplaza is a fair bit of exercise!
We don’t hafta come every day,\njust ’cause it’s your favorite!
But they have the\nBEST coffee here!
Standing all shift is rough.\nMy poor, swollen legs...
Losing and thinking about why is probably better\nthan winning by luck and not learning a thing.
I’m taking snapshots of everything I see so I can\npost it all online!
Do you suppose really big\nPokémon have to eat a lot?
Shops around here don’t earn a\nlot—everyone packs their lunch! [VAR BD0A(000A)]Text_icon1
If you’re here for the daily\nspecial, it’s already sold out.
There’s no better way to spend\na day off than with a picnic.
We’ve come here to enjoy the sun\nsince we were little girls, huh?
Two cups of coffee per day.\nThat’s my personal style.
No matter what happens,\nI’ll never leave Jaune Plaza. [VAR BD0A(000A)]Text_icon1
I wish they’d transfer me\nto a different district...
My friend always comes bragging to me ’bout\nhow many Pokémon he’s caught!
Don’t listen to him. All you need is a couple\nPokémon, if they’re ones you really love!
The people of Lumiose always gather in the plazas\nwhen something is going on.\c\nI suppose it’s the same for the Pokémon now.
I just like to sit here on the bench when I don’t\nhave plans and watch what happens in the plaza.
Behold! I’m the man who collected\none thousand coins in Paldea! [VAR BD0A(000A)]Text_icon1
Origami is pretty popular in\nLumiose too—did you know?
Anyone can become an Ace Trainer if\nthey’ve got a deep love for Pokémon!
I want to style my outfit\nto match my Pokémon!
Get chased down by a terrifying\nPokémon, and it’ll traumatize you.
Our coffee is loved by Pokémon—\nand hated by all the people.
I wonder what our Pokémon think about the\nincrease in wild Pokémon around here?
Even my battle-hardened Sharpedo seems on\nedge with all these wild Pokémon about.
We should always be kind to\nPokémon as well as people.
I want to work in an office that has Pokémon in it.\nIt sounds so relaxing, right?
Yeah, that’d be great... Pokémon don’t care about\nwhat time you show up or sign off...
So, who do we all think will\nwin big in the Z-A Royale?
Just tracking the rankings in\nthe Z-A app is fun enough.
My money’s definitely on\nJacinthe. Hands down.
If we’re going by who looks\ntough, then it’s gotta be Ivor!
Sometimes you’re just too tired to\nget mad—it’s not about being nice.
Trading with someone from a faraway region will\nget you a Pokémon that’s a bit easier to raise!
If it looks like I’ll lose, I just run away! Gotta live to\nfight another day and complete my collection!
I trained for a while with the Fist of Justice, but I\nstill don’t think I could beat a wild Pokémon.
When Pokémon unleash their\nmoves—now THAT is art!
I often pass by other couriers when I’m out\nworking. How many of us are there in this city?
Getting lost in this city is nothing!\nI’m thoroughly lost in my life! [VAR BD0A(000A)]Text_icon1

Do you rush your opponent with moves you can\nreuse rapidly again and again?\c\nOr do you bet it all on one big move, even if it\ntakes a long time to fire off?
I’m gonna become a strong Trainer and help\neveryone in Lumiose get along with Pokémon.
Did she know any good cafés?\nI’ve been looking for a new spot.
I spoke with this girl Lida\nat a café the other day...
It seems everyone’s finally ready to\nforget that Team Flare awfulness.
I tried to deliver the package, but there was this\nscary Pokémon standing guard at the door!
Well, you can’t go battling Pokémon you find in\nother people’s homes...\c\nMaybe have your partner Pokémon draw it away,\nthen yeet the package inside while it’s distracted?
A Shiny alpha...\nI’ve gotta get one...
I really can’t handle being around\nPokémon... I might have to move.
[~ 366]
My Inkay is...\nwell, it’s mm-kay.
A plaza for us and a\nplaza for Pokémon. [VAR BD0A(000A)]Text_icon1
Matching outfits\nare the greatest!
Matching outfits\nare the coolest!
I can’t decide what I’ll wish for if I manage to\nreach Rank A in the Z-A Royale...
You’d probably be better off giving some serious\nthought first to what Pokémon you’ll battle with.
I was totally stalking this one guy in the Z-A\nRoyale so I could beat him and go up a rank!
I... Yeah, there’s just no good way to respond to\nthat. Can we talk about something else?
Use any items you find, sure,\nbut use them at your own risk!
Slurpuff’s fluffy fur is\nthe best thing ever!
Living produces waste—and\nsomeone’s gotta clean it up.
Climbing stairs is hard work, but going down\nstairs also puts a lot of strain on the legs!
If Pokémon keep multiplying, maybe in the future\nit’ll be the humans who are made to battle...
The Klefki I inherited from my grandpa keeps my\nkeys safe for me.
Do you think I could use Slowpoke’s Water Gun in\nplace of a shower?
Gahhh, I don’t wanna work!\nThere’re Pokémon out there!
What about when I’m lost\nabout which move to use?
When you’re lost, find a travel spot\nnear your destination on your map!
Should I go left or right?\nOr maybe even straight?
[~ 386]
You’ve got to be on point if you’re gonna avoid\ntaking any hits!\c\nTrainers still have a part to play in battles here in\nLumiose!
You know how you start collecting something and\nthen you can’t get enough of it?\c\nI can’t get enough of that feeling.
Everyone has their own thoughts\nabout how best to raise Pokémon.
Mm, yes, and copying someone\nelse is no guarantee of success.
All these people, and there are still\ndays I don’t speak to another soul.
How are you supposed to get\nrid of Pokémon droppings?
Will throwing out more food\nscraps attract more Pokémon?
It’s her dream simply to breathe the same air as\nCanari.
I came here hoping to catch a glimpse of Canari\nfrom DYN4MO!
Hey, how about we both try\nraising the same Pokémon?
OK, but I’ll be sure\nto raise mine better!
I wonder what Lumiose was like\nwhen I was still a young girl?
This little feller used to pour his heart into his\nwork for the Gogoat Shuttle.
Historians say that Gogoat have been laboring for\nhumans for five thousand years, at least.
Scary looks are the best deterrent for bad deeds!\nBut my Krookodile is actually terribly nice.
When I know I won’t make a delivery on time, I\nsometimes have to get Manectric to help.
I’m sick and tired of this life.\nI just want to smell Pokémon!
Obsessing over beauty in art or\nvictory in battle will drive you mad.
I suppose every region’s got its good points and\nits bad points.
Hippopotas have different coloring depending on\ntheir gender.\c\nCan you tell if this one here is male or female?
Huh, so wild Pokémon\nsometimes drop things?
[~ 408]
It’s a good idea to keep up a brisk\npace when attacking in battles.
Exp. Points from battles\nmake Pokémon stronger!
You’ll always want a good stock of\nPoké Balls for when it matters.
All these wild Pokémon have\nthis old Trainer’s heart racing!
Going to a new region and seeing all kinds of\nPokémon for the first time...\c\nThat’s the best kind of trip I can think of!
My partner is reliable as anything—ready for any\nPokémon, no matter how wild they get.
My Pokémon seem to like it when\nI give ’em different feathers I find.
If we were to move to Lumiose,\nwhich district would we live in?
It’s tough to pick, but I suppose\nwhichever has the most Pokémon?
The books all say it likes to sit on people’s heads,\nyet it still hasn’t sat on mine even once!
Well, Swablu is pretty picky about cleanliness. It\neven wipes off dirty things it finds with its wings.
Walking a dead-end path knowing\nwhere it leads? That is curiosity.
Speed is vital!
There’s no point to even\nattacking if you don’t aim!
Why does shopping feel\nso satisfying, I wonder.
One item could be the difference\nbetween victory and defeat.
People and Pokémon both\nhelp each other, in the end.
Victory is thanks to the Pokémon—\ndefeat is the fault of the Trainer.
Wow, everyone’s got Pokémon around here! It\nmakes it fun just to look around as you explore.
Are there Pokémon coming to Lumiose now that\ncouldn’t even be found in Kalos a few years ago?
Shopping is the act of\nbuying things you need.
It’s become a real hassle to\nget around Lumiose by car.
If you don’t buy things, your\nwallet never gets lighter!
You’ve got to be careful to check\nfor Pokémon behind cars lately.
Circular roads are nice, yeah?\nNo beginning and no end.
I feel a bit on edge just walking\nthe town with all these Pokémon.
Strong Pokémon can simply\npark it wherever they like.
Lumiose is now redolent with Pokémon aromas.\nTruly a city after my own heart.
With wild Pokémon around every corner, us\nhumans have gotta get stronger, huh?
Those pretty feathers look so nice even after\nthey’ve been molted... I wonder how they must\r\nlook before they fall?
If I kept walking around this outer road, do you\nthink I’d discover something new each circuit?
Crisis can strike at any moment. THAT is why we\nmust train![VAR 0114(0011)]
Practice one thousand Justice Punches per day,\nand you will gain the power to pulverize anything![VAR 0114(0011)]
Following my defeat in the Z-A Royale and in\nJacinthe’s tournament, I have keenly felt just\r\nhow much I have yet to learn in this world.[VAR 0114(0011)]
I train so that my power may be of use in times of\ncrisis, but times of peace are far preferable...[VAR 0114(0011)]
Would you be interested in learning our Justice\nPunch technique, [VAR 0100(0000)]?\c\nI can give you a special discount on the dojo’s\nmonthly tuition fee![VAR 0114(0011)]
A place that can’t be found...
You need to beat Ivor.[VAR 0114(0012)]
Nighttime is when the Fist of Justice truly shines.[VAR 0114(0012)]
I haven’t gone back to city hall since that day...[VAR 0114(0012)]
I was glad to see Canari at Jacinthe’s tournament.[VAR 0114(0012)]
My Chandelure says that the city’s Pokémon are\nafraid...[VAR 0114(0012)]
Even more people have joined the Fist of Justice...\nIt’s bewildering.[VAR 0114(0012)]

         Welcome to Lumiose City, where people\n                and Pokémon flourish together.
                     My name is Jett, and I am\n                     the CEO of Quasartico Inc.
                  Pokémon are mysterious and\n                  wholly magnificent creatures.
   They thrive abundantly, right here in our midst.
         In fact, so many Pokémon now grace us\n                         with their presence...

                  These diverse creatures wield\n                      many marvelous powers.
            It’s up to all of us to work with them\n                    so we can live in harmony.
            In hopes of strengthening the bonds\n                between people and Pokémon...
        we’re imagining a new future for this city\n          through our urban redevelopment plan.
     We’ve now employed our patented holo-tech\n                    in all corners of Lumiose...
     so our interactive guides can teach you more\n                     about your surroundings.
          A city even more beautiful than before\n                              awaits all of us.
               We hope you’ll bear that in mind\n              and pardon our construction work.

Well, hello! You’re Emma’s new helper, I take it?[VAR 0114(0125)]
OK, then—let me get right to my request![VAR 0114(0125)]
You see, I’m terribly interested in Pokémon\nEvolution.[VAR 0114(0125)]
You’re familiar with how Pokémon evolve, yes?\c\nThey transform and grow strong by gaining\nExp. Points in battle, becoming close to their\r\nTrainers... All sorts of ways![VAR 0114(0125)]
Out of all the Evolution methods out there, I’m\nmost taken by those that require items to induce...[VAR 0114(0125)]
So I went to all sorts of effort to get myself such\nan item—in this case, a Thunder Stone![VAR 0114(0125)]
But there’s just one unfortunate problem...[VAR 0114(0125)]
I don’t have a single Pokémon that requires a\nThunder Stone to evolve![VAR 0114(0125)]
I did a little research, and it seems a Pokémon\ncalled Pikachu would be just what I need.[VAR 0114(0125)]
So here’s my request—please give me a Pikachu![VAR 0114(0125)]
You won’t walk away empty-handed, of course.\nI’d be happy to trade you my Heracross![VAR 0114(0125)]
If you get a Pikachu for me, I’ll give you my\nHeracross in return!\c\nI hear Pikachu can be found in Wild Zone 3.[VAR 0114(0125)]
Oh! Could it be that you already have a Pikachu\nfor me?\c\nI’d love to trade you my Heracross and take that\nPikachu off your hands, if you wouldn’t mind.[VAR 0114(0125)]
Sure thing!
Hang on a moment
So you were happy to hear out my request, but\nyou draw the line at trading with me?\c\nWhat, did you just want to show off your Pikachu\nor something?[VAR 0114(0125)]
Wonderful! Let’s get trading, then![VAR 0114(0125)]
Welcome to the family, Pikachu![VAR 0114(0125)]
As a little nice-to-meet-you gift, please allow me\nto use this Thunder Stone![VAR 0114(0125)]
Goodness me! Pikachu evolved into Raichu![VAR 0114(0125)]
Let’s see what sort of Pokémon Raichu is, shall\nwe? According to my Pokédex...\c\nit stores up electricity inside itself, then turns so\naggressive that it may attack its Trainer...[VAR 0114(0125)]
G-gosh... Well, I know the Thunder Stone isn’t the\nonly stone that makes Pokémon evolve.\c\nThere are plenty of others out there to find![VAR 0114(0125)]
Anyway, thanks ever so much for your help.[VAR 0114(0125)]
Do give Emma my regards, won’t you?[VAR 0114(0125)]
Heraaa!

So you’re a detective, are you?[VAR 0114(0126)]
That’s correct, sir
I’m just standing in
Well, if Emma’s trusted you with my request,\nthat’s gotta be good enough for me.[VAR 0114(0126)]
Because we have a situation!!!\c\nThere’s a menace on the loose in Lumiose![VAR 0114(0126)]
And that menace is none other than...[VAR 0114(0126)]
A GREAT...BIG...[VAR 0114(0126)]
BUNNELBY!!![VAR 0114(0126)]
It was massive—over twice the size of my own\nBunnelby. And its eyes had this real evil glow![VAR 0114(0126)]
When that thing locked eyes with me, I bolted\noutta there before I had the chance to think.\c\nI’ve been places and I’ve seen things...but I’ve\nnever been that scared in my life![VAR 0114(0126)]
And the worst part? It’s where I saw the thing!\c\nIt was in a plain old alleyway—not in any of the\nwild zones!!![VAR 0114(0126)]
We can’t let that Bunnelby run wild! I’ll go back\nand stake out the spot where I saw it!\c\nMake sure you [VAR FF00(0006)]turn on guidance[VAR FF00(0000)] for my request\nso you can find the right place as well![VAR 0114(0126)]
[~ 12]
That giant Bunnelby was somewhere around\nhere...\c\nHaha... Just being here makes my legs want to\nwobble right out from under me.[VAR 0114(0126)]
Bunuuu?!
What is it, bud?! Don’t tell me...it’s here already?![VAR 0114(0126)]
BUNNAAAAAA!!!
It’s HUGE![VAR 0114(0126)]
And TERRIFYING![VAR 0114(0126)]
And AWESOME!!![VAR 0114(0126)]
This is the Bunnelby! No doubt about it![VAR 0114(0126)]
BUNAAARRRGH!!!
[~ 22]
I can’t believe you took on that big ol’ Bunnelby![VAR 0114(0126)]
Watching you in action reminded me of\nsomething, actually...[VAR 0114(0126)]
A long time ago, in some region whose name I\nforgot, people used to live in fear of these giant,\r\nferocious Pokémon with glowing eyes...\c\nI hear those Pokémon were called [VAR FF00(0006)]alphas[VAR FF00(0000)].[VAR 0114(0126)]
I wonder how it is that a Pokémon like that\nshowed up in modern-day Lumiose.\c\nI couldn’t begin to guess...[VAR 0114(0126)]
What do you think, bud? Ominous or what?[VAR 0114(0126)]
Bununuuu...
Welp, either way, you really came through. Emma\nclearly has an eye for hiring help!\c\nWith someone like you looking out for Lumiose,\nwe’ll be fine even if more alphas show up, eh?[VAR 0114(0126)]

Ooh... My back...\c\nOh, pardon me, dear. Are you here to help with my\nrequest?[VAR 0114(0127)]
I lost my ring here in the Dormez Bien Cemetery,\nyou see, and it’s very important that I get it back.\c\nOoh... Gosh, my poor back...[VAR 0114(0127)]
I was visiting a loved one’s grave when a wild\nPokémon, of all things, jumped out of nowhere!\c\nOoh, did it ever give me a fright! I took a tumble\nfrom the shock, and—my! What a mess it was![VAR 0114(0127)]
Wild Pokémon running all over Lumiose, the\ncemetery turning into a wild zone... Why, I would\r\nnever have lost my ring if not for this nonsense![VAR 0114(0127)]
At any rate, it was a Pokémon called Sableye that\njumped out and gave me such an awful fright.\c\nAs I recall, that particular species is weak only to\nthe Fairy type, so mind yourself if you run into it.[VAR 0114(0127)]
I dropped my ring around the far end of the\ncemetery. I’d start searching there, dear![VAR 0114(0127)]
[~ 6]
It’s a Sableye... And it looks like it’s holding the\nring you’re searching for!
Will you battle Sableye to get the ring back?
I’ll take it on!
Not right now
BLEEEIII!!!
Sableye ran off somewhere and left behind the\nCherished Ring.[VAR 0114(0127)]
Sableye was holding the Cherished Ring.[VAR 0114(0127)]
You should return the ring to your client![VAR 0114(0127)]
[~ 15]
Hello again, dear. May I ask how the search is\ncoming along?\c\nI do hope a wild Pokémon hasn’t gobbled up my\npoor ring or done anything strange to it...[VAR 0114(0127)]
Oh! That’s it—that’s my ring![VAR 0114(0127)]
You gave the client her Cherished Ring.
What? So that Sableye was carrying my ring\naround, was it?[VAR 0114(0127)]
I didn’t think a wild Pokémon would have such\ngood taste in jewelry.[VAR 0114(0127)]
But now that I have it back, I won’t let go of this\nring again anytime soon.\c\nIt’s the wedding ring my wonderful husband gave\nme, after all.[VAR 0114(0127)]
Thank you, dear. Truly. And please, take this for\nyour troubles.[VAR 0114(0127)]
You know, perhaps I’ll ask someone to place this\nring atop my grave after I’ve passed on.[VAR 0114(0127)]
Who knows? Maybe a Sableye will make off with\nit again.[VAR 0114(0127)]
If so, I hope it brings the Sableye some happiness.\c\nIt’s the least I could do to reward its good taste—\nwhether it’s a wild Pokémon or not![VAR 0114(0127)]
After I pass on, I would be honored if a Sableye\ntook care of my ring for me.\c\nIt holds so very many cherished memories...[VAR 0114(0127)]

Hm? Do you want something from me?\c\nIf it’s a Pokémon battle you’re after, I’d be happy\nto oblige.[VAR 0114(0128)]
Heh. I bet you’re one of those uncouth Trainers\nwho uses close-range attacks, aren’t you?[VAR 0114(0128)]
I love battling Trainers like you. My long-range\nmoves always finish your sort off with style.[VAR 0114(0128)]
I simply lead my Pokémon where I want it to go,\nthen pummel opponents from a safe distance.[VAR 0114(0128)]
Though it is a shame that the cooldown time for\nlong-range attacks takes quite... Oop![VAR 0114(0128)]
Silly me. I’ll stop there before I give too much\naway. You’ll have to figure out the rest in battle![VAR 0114(0128)]
Let me know when you’re ready to learn an\nimportant lesson in tactics.[VAR 0114(0128)]
[~ 8]
So, how about it? Feeling ready to lose?[VAR 0114(0128)]
I’m ready...to win!
Hang on a moment
I don’t have all day, you know...[VAR 0114(0128)]
My favorite thing to do is launch attacks from\nafar. It truly makes for a stylish victory![VAR 0114(0128)]
[~ 14]
Y-you’re surprisingly good.[VAR 0114(0128)]
Perhaps you figured out that long-range attacks\ntake longer to execute...[VAR 0114(0128)]
But close-range attacks aren’t perfect, either.\nYou need to get right up close to your opponent\r\nbefore you can launch them.[VAR 0114(0128)]
If you’re already near your opponent, though,\nclose-range attacks are certainly the smart choice.[VAR 0114(0128)]
Not that I plan to deviate from my preferred long-\nrange attacks anytime soon.[VAR 0114(0128)]
I mean, battles are terrifying! Who would want to\nwade into the middle of all that?[VAR 0114(0128)]
[~ 21]
Long-range attacks take time to fire off, while\nclose-range attacks can be executed rapidly.\c\nIt’s all about using the right sort of move at the\nright time.[VAR 0114(0128)]

Tell me—which Pokémon type has captured your\nheart above all others?[VAR 0114(0129)]
For me, it’s the Fairy type—no doubt about it![VAR 0114(0129)]
See this furisode I’m wearing? It was designed by\na famous Trainer who specializes in Fairy types.[VAR 0114(0129)]
Turns out she and I have the same taste in\nPokémon AND fashion![VAR 0114(0129)]
Anyway, here’s an idea... Let’s have a battle where\neach of us uses our favorite Pokémon![VAR 0114(0129)]
If you’d like to test your favorite Pokémon or your\nfavorite type against mine, come talk to me again![VAR 0114(0129)]
[~ 7]
I’m a huge fan of the Fairy type! Would you like to\ntake on my wonderful Fairy-type team?[VAR 0114(0129)]
Sure, I’ll take you on!
Let me prepare...
You should try making a team that shares your\nfavorite type! Or not—a diverse team is fine, too![VAR 0114(0129)]
Then let’s get started![VAR 0114(0129)]
Moves of a certain type will have no effect against\nmy beloved Fairy-type Pokémon.\c\nI wonder if you know which type that is?[VAR 0114(0129)]
[~ 14]
Ahhh... Not the outcome I’d hoped for.[VAR 0114(0129)]
Still, don’t you think Fairy types are amazing?\c\nI mean, Dragon-type moves have absolutely no\neffect on them![VAR 0114(0129)]
Though I’m well aware that Fairy types have their\nweaknesses, too...[VAR 0114(0129)]
And when you specialize in a certain type, your\nwhole team shares the same vulnerabilities.[VAR 0114(0129)]

Budi!
Oh yes, lovely. Its posture exudes dignity and\nstrength in spades. Very nice indeed.[VAR 0114(0193)]
Its cry is...passable, I suppose.[VAR 0114(0130)]
Hrm... The lack of color in its complexion is hardly\nideal, though. This Budew needs more sunlight.[VAR 0114(0194)]

Bubu!!!
Well, look at that! What a large specimen! It\ncertainly won’t be lacking in pollen.[VAR 0114(0194)]

Now that’s a huge Gogoat if I ever saw one! It’s\nan extra helping of extra-large greatness![VAR 0114(0133)]
GAH?! It’s gargantuan! Way bigger than I’d ever\nimagined![VAR 0114(0133)]
With a beaut like this helping us out, we’ll be able\nto carry bigger packages, no problem!\c\nLooking forward to working with you, Gogoat![VAR 0114(0133)]
Gogooo!!!
Geeeh...
Aw, don’t you worry, my little helpers! I haven’t\nforgotten about you![VAR 0114(0133)]
Your experience with the Gogoat Shuttle taught\nyou everything there is to know about Lumiose!\c\nI’ll be counting on you to share your know-how\nwith our newbie here, OK? I believe in you![VAR 0114(0133)]
[~ 18]
We used to run a transit service called the Gogoat\nShuttle up until a few years ago.\c\nBut, you know, Lumiose changed, so it was time\nfor a new start for both me and my Pokémon![VAR 0114(0133)]

Lumiose is hardly short on cafés, as I’m sure\nyou’ve seen. The competition is fierce![VAR 0114(0134)]
That’s why we’re creating a new menu item to\nhelp us stand out. And what we’ve landed on is...[VAR 0114(0134)]
Pansage! Pansear! And Panpour![VAR 0114(0134)]
These three similar-seeming Pokémon have some\nrather exciting and unique traits, you see.[VAR 0114(0134)]
The leaves on Pansage’s head can relieve fatigue![VAR 0114(0134)]
The tuft on Pansear’s head contains a flame that\nburns at around 600 degrees Fahrenheit![VAR 0114(0134)]
And the water stored in the tuft on Panpour’s\nhead is packed full of nutrients![VAR 0114(0134)]
In short: revitalizing leaves, nutrient-rich water,\nand flames at an ideal temperature, yes?[VAR 0114(0134)]
If we combine each of these Pokémon’s special\ntraits, we should achieve the perfect cup of tea![VAR 0114(0134)]
Please, could you catch these three Pokémon so I\ncan briefly borrow their services?[VAR 0114(0134)]
In return, I’ll treat you to the very first cup of the\nperfect tea we’ll make![VAR 0114(0134)]
[~ 12]
Pansage, Pansear, and Panpour love high places,\nlike the trees you find lining the roads of the city.\c\nAdd all three to your party and bring them here,\nthen I’ll do the rest.[VAR 0114(0134)]
[~ 14]
Ohoho! You brought a Pansage, a Pansear, and a\nPanpour—just as I requested![VAR 0114(0134)]
Thank you so much! I’ll get right to making the\ntea, so do take a seat and settle in.[VAR 0114(0134)]
Thank you for your patience![VAR 0114(0134)]
I’m happy to report that with the aid of Pansage,\nPansear, and Panpour, I’ve created...Pantrio Tea!\c\nI thought about calling it Pansagesearpour Tea,\nbut that’s rather a mouthful...[VAR 0114(0134)]
And now, dear customer, please enjoy a cup of\nour special new brew...[VAR 0114(0134)]
Well...? What did you think? The fragrance, taste,\nand nutritional value are all top-notch, no?[VAR 0114(0134)]
Ah! But I mustn’t forget to return your dear\nPokémon to you.[VAR 0114(0134)]
Thanks to their invaluable help, we’ve now added\nPantrio Tea as a permanent menu item![VAR 0114(0134)]

Gooomaaa!
Hey, kid![VAR 0114(0004)]
Mind if I ask you a few questions?[VAR 0114(0004)]
[~ 4]
Is that your Pokémon there?[VAR 0114(002B)]
It sure isn’t, ma’am
Never seen it before
Look, I’ve got a bench covered in goo, a Goomy on\nthat bench, and then you standing right by it.[VAR 0114(002B)]
I need to figure out what happened here and how\nto keep it from happening again, and I don’t see\r\nanyone else to ask.[VAR 0114(002B)]
Do you know who this Goomy belongs to, if it’s\nnot yours?[VAR 0114(002B)]
No idea
Someone who isn’t me
No comment
I see...[VAR 0114(002B)]
Hm...[VAR 0114(002B)]
And what brings you by this particular bench\ntonight, if this isn’t your Goomy?[VAR 0114(002B)]
I wanted to pet the Goomy
I just wanted to sit down...
No comment
I guess that’s fair...[VAR 0114(002B)]
Hmm...[VAR 0114(002B)]
Are you from around here? Maybe you can point\nme to someone else who might know this Goomy.[VAR 0114(002B)]
I’m only here on vacation
No comment
Is that so...?[VAR 0114(002B)]
Hmmm...[VAR 0114(002B)]
You’re SURE this Goomy isn’t your Pokémon?[VAR 0114(002B)]
It honestly isn’t, ma’am
I do not know this Goomy
You know it’s not a big deal if it is your Goomy,\nright? I just need to get to the bottom of this.[VAR 0114(002B)]
Gooomaaa!
I can’t help but notice this Goomy is real friendly\nwith you, considering it’s not yours...[VAR 0114(002B)]
OK, how about this. If this really isn’t your Goomy,\nyou won’t mind showing me the Pokémon you’re\r\nactually here with, will you?[VAR 0114(002B)]
To be clear—I’m challenging you to a battle, kid.\nLet’s see your team up close![VAR 0114(002B)]
[~ 35]
You certainly put up a good fight. I’ll give you that.[VAR 0114(002B)]
Right, then. NOW will you admit that this Goomy\nis actually yours?[VAR 0114(002B)]
Goomy! I told you not to wander off![VAR 0114(0021)]
Gooomaaa!
You got that bench all sticky, too...[VAR 0114(0021)]
There! All cleaned up. Come on, Goomy—let’s\nhead home![VAR 0114(0021)]
That, er...that wasn’t your Goomy after all, then.[VAR 0114(002B)]
I’m sorry, kid. There are so many wild Pokémon\naround Lumiose these days—I’m feeling the\r\npressure to head off trouble when I see it.[VAR 0114(002B)]
Let me share a tip with you to make up for all\nthe trouble.\c\nTo evolve Goomy into its final Evolution, you’ll\nneed to make use of rain![VAR 0114(002B)]
With that, I’ll take my leave. Thanks for bearing\nwith me today, kid![VAR 0114(002B)]

Bingo! I smell a Lumiose local...[VAR 0114(0136)]
I mean, er, bonjour!\c\nSorry to bother you, mate, but you wouldn’t\nhappen to have a Slowpoke, would you?[VAR 0114(0136)]
The Slowpoke back home in Galar have a yellow\nhead and tail, like this dapper chap here.[VAR 0114(0136)]
But I hear they look different in other regions![VAR 0114(0136)]
And, lucky for me, I also hear that wild Slowpoke\nhave started popping up in Lumiose lately![VAR 0114(0136)]
I’m only here on holiday for a little while, so I’m\nkeen to get hold of a local Slowpoke while I can![VAR 0114(0136)]
If you have one on you, would you trade it for my\nGalarian Slowpoke?[VAR 0114(0136)]
[~ 8]
If you have a Slowpoke like the ones you can\ncatch here in Lumiose, please trade it to me![VAR 0114(0136)]
[~ 10]
You up to trade your local Slowpoke for my\nGalarian Slowpoke?[VAR 0114(0136)]
Of course!
I’d rather not
Nice! Let’s hop to it, then.[VAR 0114(0136)]
Galarian Slowpoke are pretty rare around here,\nyou know. Just saying.[VAR 0114(0136)]
I’m looking for a Slowpoke that can’t be found in\nGalar. Don’t let me down![VAR 0114(0136)]
Whoa! This Slowpoke even SMELLS different to\nthe Slowpoke from back home![VAR 0114(0136)]
And—my days—look at the size of it! Is it all right\nfor a Slowpoke to get this big?![VAR 0114(0136)]
I figured it’d look different, but this beefiness is\nentirely unexpected![VAR 0114(0136)]
Poooke?
Oh, but there’s that same old Slowpoke face.\nSome things never change, eh?[VAR 0114(0136)]
Thanks for trading me this special Slowpoke. I\nalready love it to bits![VAR 0114(0136)]
I hear it’ll look even less like its Galarian\ncounterpart when it evolves into Slowbro...[VAR 0114(0136)]
See, Galarian Slowbro are Poison types, so they—[VAR 0114(0136)]
Oop! Actually, I’ll let you find out what happens\nfor yourself. Wouldn’t want to spoil the fun![VAR 0114(0136)]
Take care of my Galarian Slowpoke, yeah?[VAR 0114(0136)]
[~ 27]
Thanks for the brilliant Slowpoke. Take care of my\nGalarian Slowpoke, yeah?[VAR 0114(0136)]

Oh, excellent timing! I can tell you’re a Trainer—\nand a talented one at that![VAR 0114(0138)]
We’ve got a knack for battling, ourselves.\c\nEspecially since we switched up our battle tactics.\nWe’ve been on a crazy winning streak![VAR 0114(0137)]
What’s the secret to our success, you ask?\c\nWhy, status moves, of course![VAR 0114(0138)]
Status moves boost your Pokémon’s strength![VAR 0114(0137)]
And they can weaken your opponents, too![VAR 0114(0138)]
Expert battlers like us know better than to just\ndish out damage nonstop![VAR 0114(0137)]
You’ll see what we mean soon enough![VAR 0114(0138)]
If you’re fool—I mean—brave enough to take on\nour status moves, we’ll gladly battle you![VAR 0114(0137)]
Let me know when you’re ready.[VAR 0114(0137)]
[~ 10]
Are you all limbered up and ready to run—er, I\nmean—battle?[VAR 0114(0137)]
Let’s go, go, go!
I need to prep
No worries—us status move masters know how\nto pace ourselves. We’ll wait for the right time.[VAR 0114(0137)]
My Pokémon specialize in status moves that\nboost their stats![VAR 0114(0137)]
The longer our battle lasts, the more we’ll drive\nyour team into a corner![VAR 0114(0137)]
[~ 17]
The two of us are on a roll! Be a dear and help us\nset an even higher record for our winning streak![VAR 0114(0138)]
[~ 19]
Argh! You totally wrecked our winning streak![VAR 0114(0137)]
Hold on—we’re not out of the game yet! If I win,\nthat means our streak is still unbroken![VAR 0114(0138)]
It’s my turn now. I won’t let you put an end to our\nperfect string of victories![VAR 0114(0138)]
[~ 23]
If I beat you, our winning streak can keep going!\nAre you ready to begin?[VAR 0114(0138)]
Let’s go, go, go!
I need to prep
Really? Or are you nervous about having your\nPokémon weakened by mine?[VAR 0114(0138)]
My Pokémon specialize in status moves that lower\nthe opponent’s stats![VAR 0114(0138)]
That’s right—get ready to watch your Pokémon’s\nusual power go flying out the window![VAR 0114(0138)]
[~ 30]
Our streak isn’t over until we’re both down. It\ndoesn’t count if you beat only one of us![VAR 0114(0137)]
[~ 32]
I...I can’t believe our status moves weren’t\nenough to beat you...[VAR 0114(0138)]
My Pokémon powered themselves up and\neverything...[VAR 0114(0137)]
And my Pokémon powered yours down...[VAR 0114(0138)]
Why wasn’t that enough to win?![VAR 0114(0137)]
Could you give us some advice? What should we\ndo to be better Trainers?[VAR 0114(0138)]
Believe in your Pokémon
Train your Pokémon well
Hmph. Well said![VAR 0114(0137)]
Raising and lowering stats are valid strategies, but\nthey’re not surefire ways to win, I suppose.[VAR 0114(0138)]
Thanks for the valuable lesson. There’s so much\nwe still have to learn about Pokémon battles.[VAR 0114(0137)]
Agreed! Thank you so much, mystery Trainer. I’m\nso glad we could battle you![VAR 0114(0138)]

Lumiose City is just bursting with Pokémon!\nDon’t you think it’s wonderful?[VAR 0114(0139)]
After hearing how folks here live in harmony with\nPokémon, I just had to visit and see for myself.\r\nAnd I’m so, so glad I did![VAR 0114(0139)]
When it comes to getting along with Pokémon,\nthough, I could give the city a run for its money![VAR 0114(0139)]
See my two cuties here? They were a Cleffa and a\nBuneary when I first became their Trainer.[VAR 0114(0139)]
We’ve been traveling together ever since—and\nthanks to that, they were able to evolve into\r\nClefairy and Lopunny![VAR 0114(0139)]
See, these Pokémon don’t evolve unless they’re\nreally friendly with their Trainer![VAR 0114(0139)]
Ah! But here’s an idea: Why don’t we have a\nbattle?\c\nThat way, I can show you just how close I am with\nmy dear Pokémon![VAR 0114(0139)]
Let me know when you’re in the mood for a\nbattle, all right?[VAR 0114(0139)]
[~ 9]
How about a battle, then? Clefairy and Lopunny\nare keen to show you just how close we all are![VAR 0114(0139)]
Let’s do it!
No, thanks
Oh, that’s no fun![VAR 0114(0139)]
Great! Let’s keep it nice and friendly, shall we?[VAR 0114(0139)]
[~ 15]
Dear me. It looks like we lost![VAR 0114(0139)]
You and your Pokémon were really working as a\nperfect team![VAR 0114(0139)]
You might even be just as friendly with your\nPokémon as I am with mine![VAR 0114(0139)]
Oh, but speaking of my Pokémon...[VAR 0114(0139)]
my two cuties must be feeling pretty down after\nlosing to you.[VAR 0114(0139)]
But some quality relaxation time here at the café\nshould cheer them up in no time![VAR 0114(0139)]
You know that’s a great thing to do, right?[VAR 0114(0139)]
Spending time at cafés with your Pokémon helps\nyou deepen your bonds and become close friends![VAR 0114(0139)]
Make sure to try it out with your own darling\nPokémon, won’t you?[VAR 0114(0139)]

No one does cozy time at cafés better than me\nand my cuties. We’re unbeatable friends![VAR 0114(0139)]

Pokémon battles are nuanced. You can’t expect to\nwin just by using strong moves all the time![VAR 0114(013A)]
Spreading that message is why I battle.[VAR 0114(013A)]
If you really want to become stronger, then let me\nteach you about barriers—moves that reduce the\r\ndamage your Pokémon take.[VAR 0114(013A)]
Talk to me if you want to battle.[VAR 0114(013A)]
[~ 5]
I’ll show you what barriers can do. Are you ready\nto face me?[VAR 0114(013A)]
I’m ready!
Not yet
I get why you’re dragging your feet. Nobody likes\nlosing, I guess.[VAR 0114(013A)]
My Pokémon use moves that reduce the incoming\ndamage from opponents’ attacks.\c\nSome of us call these moves “barriers”![VAR 0114(013A)]
[~ 11]
You’re way stronger than I expected! I don’t think\nyou need me to teach you about barriers...[VAR 0114(013A)]
Still, a promise is a promise. Let me explain the\nmoves my Pokémon used.[VAR 0114(013A)]
The move Reflect reduces the damage the user’s\nteam takes from physical moves for a while.[VAR 0114(013A)]
Light Screen is similar, but it reduces the damage\ntaken from special moves instead.[VAR 0114(013A)]
You’ll have a lot more opportunities in battle if\nyour Pokémon are taking less damage.[VAR 0114(013A)]
I gotta admit, it feels kinda embarrassing to\nlecture someone who beat me.\c\nI’m sure you’ll have no problem combining moves\nto get all sorts of effects.[VAR 0114(013A)]
[~ 18]
It’s super important to combine the effects of\ndifferent moves if you want to win![VAR 0114(013A)]

The problem, you see, is that I can’t get a hot\nenough flame in my kitchen.\c\nLitleo here provides our firepower, but it can’t\nburn at max heat until it lets loose in battle![VAR 0114(013B)]
So I must ask for your help, kind stranger!\c\nWould you have a sizzling battle with me and my\nLitleo to get it nice and fired up?[VAR 0114(013B)]
Let me know when you’re ready to have a sizzling\nhot Pokémon battle![VAR 0114(013B)]
[~ 6]
Will you battle my Litleo so it can crank up the\nheat in my kitchen?[VAR 0114(013B)]
I’ll light its fire!
Not my vibe
Oof, the cold shoulder... And at this rate, my\ncustomers will be getting cold food too...[VAR 0114(013B)]
Give us a battle so hot it feels like being roasted\nby a Flare Blitz![VAR 0114(013B)]
[~ 12]
What an intense battle! I almost caught fire\nmyself![VAR 0114(013B)]
How about it, Litleo?\c\nAfter a battle like that, I bet you can show me the\nhottest flames you can make, eh?[VAR 0114(013B)]
Graa-raowr!
That’s the spirit, Litleo!\c\nWe’ll need your hottest flames if we want to grill\ntoday’s steaks just right![VAR 0114(013B)]
Thank you so much! Here’s something for that\nfine battle. Use it on a Pokémon that’s burned.[VAR 0114(013B)]
Back to the kitchen for us, Litleo.\c\nMy customers today are in luck! They’ll be dining\non steaks with the absolute perfect sear![VAR 0114(013B)]

Wild Weedle have been devouring the plants in\nthis beautiful garden recently...[VAR 0114(013C)]
To make matters worse, there’s a big one too...\nIt’s an alpha Weedle, I think.\c\nI’ve chased the pests away so many times, but\nthey keep coming back.[VAR 0114(013C)]
I suppose it’s a testament to how healthy and\nbeautiful I’ve kept the greenery here. But still.[VAR 0114(013C)]
Maybe if someone could catch the alpha Weedle\ninstead of chasing it away, the other Weedle\r\nwould stop coming back as well.[VAR 0114(013C)]
I beg you! Please catch that alpha Weedle while\nit’s around here during the day![VAR 0114(013C)]
[~ 6]
Wreee!
[~ 8]
Please—catch that alpha Weedle![VAR 0114(013C)]

My dear plants should be safe now...[VAR 0114(013C)]
I’m relieved, and yet...I feel a little empty inside.\c\nCould it be that those Weedle wormed their way\ninto my heart?[VAR 0114(013C)]
Say, young Trainer...I don’t suppose you’d let me\nhave that alpha Weedle?[VAR 0114(013C)]
Sure, it’s yours!
Nope, it’s mine
Ahhh... I never appreciated it before, but this\nWeedle has such a magnificent poison stinger![VAR 0114(013C)]
We may have fought over it eating my plants, but\nthat’s just proof of my green thumb![VAR 0114(013C)]
From now on, I’ll have this Weedle guard my\nplants, and I’ll feed it choice leaves in return.\r\nThank you for all your help, young Trainer![VAR 0114(013C)]
Hmm... I suppose a Trainer is better equipped to\nhandle that Weedle than a gardener like me...\r\nWell, do take good care of it![VAR 0114(013C)]
[~ 21]
The alpha Weedle helps me keep all the other\nWeedle away![VAR 0114(013C)]

Wild zones are great, aren’t they? I get to spend\nmy days catching Magikarp.[VAR 0114(013D)]
Have a look! I was able to catch an extra-large\nMagikarp! It said XL in its summary, so I know\r\nfor sure it’s a big one.[VAR 0114(013D)]
It’s extra large and extra splashy![VAR 0114(013D)]
Y’know, I daresay there isn’t a single Magikarp\nout there that’s bigger than mine![VAR 0114(013D)]
Why, if you DO manage to catch a Magikarp that’s\nbigger than XL, I’d love to see it.[VAR 0114(013D)]
S’pose I have heard there’s an unusually large\nMagikarp in Wild Zone 2.\c\nBut that’s just a rumor, mind you.[VAR 0114(013D)]
[~ 7]
I dare you to show me a Magikarp that’s bigger\nthan mine![VAR 0114(013D)]
There’s no way any Magikarp out there is bigger\nthan mine.[VAR 0114(013D)]
It seems so tiny compared to my Magikarp![VAR 0114(013D)]
I knew you couldn’t find a bigger Magikarp!\nHahaha![VAR 0114(013D)]
What’s this? That Magikarp of yours...[VAR 0114(013D)]
Whew! You had me worried for a moment, but my\nMagikarp is sliiightly bigger![VAR 0114(013D)]
H-how in the world did it get so HUGE?![VAR 0114(013D)]
It’s...it’s an alpha?[VAR 0114(013D)]
What do you mean it’s an alpha?! That’s cheating![VAR 0114(013D)]
Besides, I’m not accepting defeat just yet![VAR 0114(013D)]
Everyone knows the true sign of a superior\nMagikarp is how high it can jump!\c\nLet’s have a jump-off![VAR 0114(013D)]
On your mark, get set, GO! Do your thing, my XL\nMagikarp![VAR 0114(013D)]
Such...such mighty jumping power...[VAR 0114(013D)]
I admit defeat. There’s no way I can compete with\nthat.[VAR 0114(013D)]
An alpha Magikarp isn’t just big... It can jump\nhigher than anything I’ve ever seen.[VAR 0114(013D)]
At least this experience gave me a new goal—I’m\ngoing to catch my own alpha Magikarp![VAR 0114(013D)]
I’ll have a whole army of massive Magikarp!\nOnward to Wild Zone 2![VAR 0114(013D)]

Huh? What’re you lookin’ at?![VAR 0114(001B)]
Actually, you’re gonna help us sort this out![VAR 0114(001C)]
All you gotta do is face us in battle. Easy, right?[VAR 0114(001C)]
First, it’ll be one of your Pokémon against my\nArbok, one-on-one.[VAR 0114(001B)]
Then, same deal with him. One of your Pokémon\nversus his Glalie.[VAR 0114(001B)]
It’s decided! We’ll decide once and for all which\nof our Pokémon is stronger—by battling you![VAR 0114(001C)]

[~ 16]
You better give this loser a proper whipping![VAR 0114(001C)]
[~ 18]
My Arbok...lost...[VAR 0114(001B)]
Pahahaha! Who’d have thought, eh? Well, guess\nthis means my Glalie really must be the strongest![VAR 0114(001C)]
Now your Pokémon and my Glalie are going to\nhave a one-on-one![VAR 0114(001C)]
[~ 22]
You’re battlin’ me and my Glalie next! As a one-\non-one thing, obviously.[VAR 0114(001C)]
Gonna win again
I still need to prep
That so? I’m just gonna assume that means my\nGlalie is the strongest.[VAR 0114(001C)]
What part of “one-on-one” did you not get?[VAR 0114(001C)]
You don’t stand a chance![VAR 0114(001C)]
[~ 29]
Blast... Who...who in the world are you?[VAR 0114(001B)]
[~ 31]
I can’t believe it... Even my Glalie was defeated like\nit was nothin’...[VAR 0114(001C)]
Well, ain’t this just great! We both got stomped![VAR 0114(001B)]
This can only mean one thing... My Arbok isn’t\nthe strongest, and neither is your Glalie.[VAR 0114(001B)]
That’s right! The strongest is this kid’s partner\n[VAR 0101(0002)]![VAR 0114(001C)]
We were just big Magikarp in a small pond...[VAR 0114(001B)]
I know what to strive for now, though—thanks to\nyou, kid![VAR 0114(001C)]
Right! And I’m gonna strive way harder and leave\nthis chump and his Glalie in the dust![VAR 0114(001B)]
As if I’d let you get ahead of me! We’re gonna\nkeep battlin’ so I can put you in your place![VAR 0114(001C)]

See these little ones here? They’re Trubbish, the\nTrash Bag Pokémon.[VAR 0114(013E)]
They’ve developed a taste for our café’s food\nscraps, so they keep coming back...[VAR 0114(013E)]
Truuub!
I’m happy they like our food, don’t get me wrong.\c\nBut that smell the Trubbish give off isn’t exactly a\ncrowd pleaser. We’re starting to lose customers...[VAR 0114(013E)]
Oh! Here’s a thought.[VAR 0114(013E)]
If it’s our food these Trubbish are after, maybe we\ncan use that to our advantage![VAR 0114(013E)]
I’ve made a nice bag of Tasty Trash using our food\nscraps. Do you think you could use it to lead the\r\nTrubbish over to the garbage bins?[VAR 0114(013E)]
It would really help us out if you could lead the\nTrubbish away as soon as you can![VAR 0114(013E)]
Oh—I guess there’s a battle zone active right\nnow...\c\nLet’s postpone this business with the Trubbish\nuntil tomorrow, then![VAR 0114(013E)]
[~ 10]
If you’re free right now, would you mind leading\nthe Trubbish to the nearby garbage bins?[VAR 0114(013E)]
Sure thing!
Hold on a sec
I’d do it myself, you understand, but I’m still\nworking my shift...[VAR 0114(013E)]
Thanks! That’s a big help![VAR 0114(013E)]
The Trubbish should follow you as long as you’re\nholding this.[VAR 0114(013E)]
Make sure you walk slowly so the Trubbish don’t\nlose you![VAR 0114(013E)]
The garbage bins are down this alleyway.\nGood luck![VAR 0114(013E)]
[~ 19]
Please drop off the Tasty Trash at the far end of\nthis alleyway![VAR 0114(013E)]
[~ 21]
You need to lead the Trubbish to the garbage bins\nat the end of the alleyway!
[~ 23]
Do you want to leave the Tasty Trash here?
Drop it off
Not yet
Truuuuuub!
The Trubbish are wolfing down the Tasty Trash...
Thanks so much for dropping off our trash![VAR 0114(013E)]
The smell from the Trubbish shouldn’t reach the\ncafé if they stay here.[VAR 0114(013E)]
But, gosh, look at them munching happily away.[VAR 0114(013E)]
It makes you think, doesn’t it?\c\nCoexisting with Pokémon doesn’t just mean\nsharing the same space...[VAR 0114(013E)]
I mean, these Trubbish love our food just like\nhumans do, but it wouldn’t work to have them\r\neat at our café right next to other customers.[VAR 0114(013E)]
Maybe coexisting with Pokémon sometimes\nmeans knowing the right distance to keep.[VAR 0114(013E)]
[~ 35]
Looks like you have some\nadmirers! How adorable!
Oh? Something\nsmells a bit off...
You doing a Falinks impression?\nSeems tough, but hang in there!
Trubbish, hm? Aren’t those the\nlittle helpers that eat garbage?
An outing with a troupe of\nTrubbish, eh? Nice work!

And it was a Berry, no less! Gosh, that’s rare for\nyou, Delilah.
You give most people bug Pokémon, don’t you,\nyou little scamp!

You’re a Trainer, aren’t you? I’ve got a request for\nyou, if you don’t mind...[VAR 0114(013F)]
Some very strange things have been happening in\nmy apartment block, you see.[VAR 0114(013F)]
The sort of things you might even call “paranormal\nactivity,” if you believe in all that.[VAR 0114(013F)]
Speakers in empty rooms have suddenly started\nplaying music, our building keeps losing power...[VAR 0114(013F)]
On top of all that, we’ve been hearing eerie\nsounds from up on the roof.[VAR 0114(013F)]
I would love to get to the bottom of things, but\nit’s got me rather spooked, to be honest.[VAR 0114(013F)]

Oh?[VAR 0114(013F)]
De de...
I suppose faulty speakers and power outages are\nelectrical issues, aren’t they![VAR 0114(013F)]
So a naughty little Dedenne has been behind all\nthis! It’s been absorbing our electricity, then?[VAR 0114(013F)]
De de...
What a relief! If it really had been paranormal\nactivity, I would’ve had to move across town![VAR 0114(013F)]
But I suppose we can’t let this Dedenne keep\nwreaking havoc with our circuits... What to do?[VAR 0114(013F)]
Denneeeeee!
OK, how about this. Let’s search for a Trainer to\nlook after you properly, shall we?\c\nIn the meantime, you’re not to steal electricity.\nIf you do, you’re out on the street—got it?[VAR 0114(013F)]
De...
Now I’ll finally have some peace of mind, thanks\nto you! I’m so grateful for your help![VAR 0114(013F)]

It looks like my Sylvie’s picking up on some\nstrong emotions nearby.[VAR 0114(0140)]
Sylveon can use their feelers to send out an aura\nthat people find very soothing, you know.[VAR 0114(0140)]
It certainly comes in handy for putting an end to\nbickering and fighting![VAR 0114(0140)]

Hi there! I’m a specialist in restoring Pokémon\nfossils.[VAR 0114(0141)]
Did you know that the [VAR FF00(0006)]Stone Emporium[VAR FF00(0000)] here in\nLumiose has two varieties of fossil for sale?[VAR 0114(0141)]
They’re the Jaw Fossil and the Sail Fossil.\c\nI’ve had my eye on them for a while now, but I\njust can’t decide which one to get![VAR 0114(0141)]

You know, it’s my dream to open a Furfrou salon\nwith my Scyther someday.[VAR 0114(0142)]
Do you know much about Furfrou? It’s a really\nfluffy Pokémon whose fur can be trimmed into all\r\nsorts of fun styles![VAR 0114(0142)]
It’d be amazing if my Scyther could learn the\nproper technique for trimming Furfrou.[VAR 0114(0142)]
To do that, Scyther would first need to master a\nmove called Slash.[VAR 0114(0142)]
Scyyy!
I’m thinking the best way to learn would be to\ncopy someone who’s already mastered it![VAR 0114(0142)]
Maybe you could have your Pokémon show us\nhow it’s done?[VAR 0114(0142)]
All you need to do is use [VAR FF00(0006)]Slash[VAR FF00(0000)] on the Substitute\ndoll right over there![VAR 0114(0142)]

OK! Now that we’ve seen how to do it, let’s give it\na go, Scyther![VAR 0114(0142)]
Scythaaa!!!
Oh, that was perfect! I knew you could do it![VAR 0114(0142)]

Now we can handle Furfrou trims for sure.[VAR 0114(0142)]
Scytha!
We couldn’t have gotten this far without your\nhandy demonstration. Thank you![VAR 0114(0142)]
With that, I’ll go ahead and open up our salon for\nbusiness![VAR 0114(0142)]

Our salon offers a few trims for Furfrou right now,\nbut there are many more styles we need to learn.[VAR 0114(0142)]
If Scyther’s going to be able to handle new trims,\nit’ll need to use moves other than Slash...[VAR 0114(0142)]
Could we ask you to show us your technique for\n[VAR FF00(0006)]Razor Leaf[VAR FF00(0000)]—a move that cuts with leaves?\c\nOnce Scyther sees how it’s done, it should be\nable to master the principles behind the move.[VAR 0114(0142)]
Just like last time, try having your Pokémon use\n[VAR FF00(0006)]Razor Leaf[VAR FF00(0000)] on the Substitute doll over there![VAR 0114(0142)]
Now that you’ve heard my request, would you like\nto have your Furfrou trimmed?[VAR 0114(0142)]

Wow! Those leaves were razor-sharp, all right![VAR 0114(0142)]
OK, Scyther! Learn from the move we just saw to\nmake lots of nice, precise cuts...[VAR 0114(0142)]
Scythaaa!!!
Oh, look at that precision! Your scything has really\nimproved by leaps and bounds![VAR 0114(0142)]
We should have no problem trimming Furfrou fur\ninto more complex styles now![VAR 0114(0142)]

Well, hello! I’d like to ask you for yet another favor\nthat’ll help level up my Scyther’s skills.[VAR 0114(0142)]
This time, could you show us Psycho Cut? It’s a\nmove that cuts using the power of the mind![VAR 0114(0142)]
And no, I’m not kidding—that’s a real move!\c\nThe user wields their psychic power to form a\nblade that cuts exactly as they will it.[VAR 0114(0142)]
Try having your Pokémon use [VAR FF00(0006)]Psycho Cut[VAR FF00(0000)] on the\nSubstitute doll right over there![VAR 0114(0142)]

Um. It’s [VAR FF00(0006)]Psycho Cut[VAR FF00(0000)] we’d like to see, OK?[VAR 0114(0142)]
So THAT’S what Psycho Cut looks like![VAR 0114(0142)]
With a blade materialized from your mind, you can\nmake just about any cut you can imagine![VAR 0114(0142)]
OK, Scyther! Fix the image of that move in your\nmind and let loose![VAR 0114(0142)]
Scythaaa!!!
That’s the stuff! If you keep that up, even the\ntrickiest trims should be a cinch for you![VAR 0114(0142)]
Scythaaa!
Scyther learned how to swing its scythes at\nsuperhigh speeds!\c\nThe Furfrou salon’s selection of trims has now\nincreased!
Now that Scyther’s learned all the cuts it needs,\nwe can finally offer customers the full repertoire\r\nof gorgeous Furfrou trims![VAR 0114(0142)]
And it’s entirely thanks to you![VAR 0114(0142)]
So keep bringing your Furfrou to us for the latest\ntrims, OK?[VAR 0114(0142)]
I know Scyther would love the chance to keep\npracticing its skills![VAR 0114(0142)]

Hey, kid! Are you making good use of traps in your\nPokémon battles?[VAR 0114(0143)]
Oh. Traps are moves that spread obstacles around\nthe battlefield—fire, rocks, things like that.[VAR 0114(0143)]
Traps can get in your way on the field, or they can\ninflict damage when you touch them.[VAR 0114(0143)]
Want to see for yourself just how scary they are?\nI’d be happy to show you![VAR 0114(0143)]
Come talk to me again when you’re ready to learn\nabout traps with a good old battle![VAR 0114(0143)]
[~ 6]
Trap moves are something of a specialty of mine.\nWant to face me in battle?[VAR 0114(0143)]
I’ll take you on!
I need to prep
Prep, huh? Not sure there’s much you can do to\nprepare for traps, if I’m honest...[VAR 0114(0143)]
Just so you know—my Pokémon’s moves are all\ntrap moves![VAR 0114(0143)]
Think you can avoid each and every one?[VAR 0114(0143)]
[~ 13]
Not going to lie—I didn’t think you’d be able to\nbeat me through all those traps I laid out for you.[VAR 0114(0143)]
It’s hard going when you’re dodging obstacles all\nover the place, right?[VAR 0114(0143)]
You should try using trap moves yourself in the\nfuture. Battle smart, not hard, eh?[VAR 0114(0143)]

Hey, friend. Bird Pokémon come in all shapes and\nsizes—we all know that, right?[VAR 0114(0144)]
But Pidgey, Pidgeotto, and Pidgeot will always\nhave a special place in my heart![VAR 0114(0144)]
I even joined the delivery company I’m working\nfor because their logo is a bird Pokémon!\c\nThough it’s a Talonflame, not a Pidgeot or\nanything...[VAR 0114(0144)]
Pidgeot and its evolutionary line can use the move\nFly, you know. It’s a pretty amazing move![VAR 0114(0144)]
Want to taste the power of the move Fly from my\nbird Pokémon?![VAR 0114(0144)]
Just let me know when you’re ready to take on\nmy high-flying team![VAR 0114(0144)]
[~ 7]
I know you’ll fall in love with Pidgeot and the rest\nonce you face them! Shall we battle, then?[VAR 0114(0144)]
Of course!
No, thanks!
Aw, what? C’mon, give my bird Pokémon a\nchance to win you over![VAR 0114(0144)]
All riiight! First up is Pidgey! Fly high into the sky,\nmy feathered friend![VAR 0114(0144)]
[~ 13]
Hmph. I lost that one, but my bird Pokémon put\non a great show, right? I bet you were impressed![VAR 0114(0144)]
The rest of Lumiose will be too, once I’ve spread\nthe good word about how awesome Pidgeot is.[VAR 0114(0144)]
Someday, I’ll even get my company to swap their\nlogo from a Talonflame to a Pidgeot! You’ll see![VAR 0114(0144)]

Oh! You won the Canari Quiz Whiz Contest, right?\nWhat a surprise, running into you here![VAR 0114(0145)]
As the Quiz Whiz, I’m sure you already know that\nCanari’s partner is Eelektross.[VAR 0114(0145)]
I want to have the same partner Pokémon as her,\nso I’ve been training up some Eelektrik.[VAR 0114(0145)]
All that’s left is to pick the strongest Eelektrik and\nevolve it into Eelektross with a Thunder Stone.[VAR 0114(0145)]
And to think I would run into you at this crucial\nmoment! A miraculous bolt from the blue![VAR 0114(0145)]
O Quiz Whiz, please honor me with a battle!\c\nHelp me choose the strongest, most electrifying\nEelektrik![VAR 0114(0145)]
Once you’re ready to battle, please let me know.[VAR 0114(0145)]
[~ 8]
O Quiz Whiz, please honor me with a battle!\c\nHelp me choose the strongest, most electrifying\nEelektrik![VAR 0114(0145)]
I’ll take you on!
Not right now
Yes, of course! I will wait however long you need![VAR 0114(0145)]
Thank you! Only a Quiz Whiz of your caliber can\nhelp me choose the strongest Eelektrik![VAR 0114(0145)]
Oh no, we’re in a battle zone now!\c\nThere’s no way we can properly focus on having a\ngreat battle here—let’s reconvene later![VAR 0114(0145)]
[~ 15]
Wow. Not only are you the Canari Quiz Whiz but\nyou also have exceptional skill in battle![VAR 0114(0145)]
We may have lost, but I’ve seen enough to decide\nwhich of my Eelektrik I’ll use a Thunder Stone on![VAR 0114(0145)]
Don’t be a fool, Anguil![VAR 0114(0035)]
Mani, sir! Have I done something wrong?[VAR 0114(0145)]
Canari’s cherished Eelektross wasn’t chosen\nbased on how strong it was as an Eelektrik.[VAR 0114(0035)]
On the contrary, it was a weak Eelektrik that she\ntrained up into the strongest Eelektross![VAR 0114(0035)]
Wh-what? A shocking revelation![VAR 0114(0145)]
Bzzz!
A true Canatic adores, appreciates, and accepts all\nof their Eelektrik, regardless of strength![VAR 0114(0035)]
And you, my dear Quiz Whiz comrade! You have\nmy thanks for sparring with this young Canatic.[VAR 0114(0035)]
Come, Anguil—let us train with other Canatics to\nfurther solidify our DYN4MO bonds![VAR 0114(0035)]

No way—I’m terrified

That’s the spirit! Let’s DO THIS![VAR 0114(0146)]
[~ 11]
Gah! You beat my high-energy tactics AND my\nPokémon’s Focus Energy! Incredible![VAR 0114(0146)]
Like I said, Focus Energy makes the user’s attacks\nmore likely to be critical hits![VAR 0114(0146)]
So what happens if you combine it with moves\nthat are already likely to land critical hits, huh?!\c\nOr if you combine it with items that raise your\ncritical-hit ratio?![VAR 0114(0146)]
Hoo boy, I need to get back to the office RIGHT\nNOW and run some experiments!\c\nGotta take some deep breaths to focus my own\nenergy first, though! Fweee... Haaah...[VAR 0114(0146)]

You there![VAR 0114(0147)]
Have you ever had someone use the move Protect\nagainst you in a Pokémon battle?[VAR 0114(0147)]
It’s so neat how when a Pokémon uses Protect, it\nnegates all incoming damage![VAR 0114(0147)]
But I actually prefer the move Detect!\c\nSure, maybe Protect keeps your Pokémon safe for\nlonger, but you can use Detect more frequently![VAR 0114(0147)]
Let’s have a battle, Trainer. Let me show you how\nstrong Detect is![VAR 0114(0147)]
Just give a shout when you’re ready to have a\nbattle with me![VAR 0114(0147)]
[~ 7]
Battle me! That way, you’ll see how wonderful\nDetect is![VAR 0114(0147)]
Sure, show me!
Maybe later
Aha! I bet you detect that you’ll lose to me![VAR 0114(0147)]
I’ll show you that my Pokémon can detect any\nmove your Pokémon may throw at us![VAR 0114(0147)]
[~ 13]
Hah... Whew...[VAR 0114(0147)]
So? What’d you think of how my Pokémon used\nDetect? Way different from Protect, right?[VAR 0114(0147)]
Yeah, totally different
They do the same thing
Right?![VAR 0114(0147)]
Not at all!!![VAR 0114(0147)]
Sure, they both prevent your Pokémon from\ntaking damage...[VAR 0114(0147)]
Detect is just SO MUCH COOLER, though! Call it\npersonal preference if you must![VAR 0114(0147)]
In the end, finding your personal battle style is all\nthat matters! Well...maybe not ALL that matters.[VAR 0114(0147)]

Nice view up here, isn’t it?[VAR 0114(0148)]

Hey, what do you say to having an interesting\nPokémon battle with me?[VAR 0114(0148)]
One where we both use only Flying-type\nPokémon![VAR 0114(0148)]
You can have as many Pokémon on your team as\nyou like, as long as they all share the Flying type.\r\nHow about it?[VAR 0114(0148)]
Let me know once you’re ready to have a battle\nusing Flying types only.[VAR 0114(0148)]

Why don’t we have a battle where we only have\nFlying-type Pokémon on our teams?[VAR 0114(0148)]

Ah, I see you have only Flying-type Pokémon on\nyour team. Let’s get our battle going, then![VAR 0114(0148)]

Hm? Need to reconsider the Pokémon on your\nteam? Don’t worry—take your time.[VAR 0114(0148)]

Look at those Flying-type skills! You’re practically\na Sky Trainer yourself![VAR 0114(0148)]
You know, Sky Battles were something of a fad\nhere in Kalos a while back.[VAR 0114(0148)]
People would battle using only Pokémon that\ncould fly or float.[VAR 0114(0148)]

My Pokémon grow stronger in the rain, you know![VAR 0114(0149)]
We should have a battle when it’s raining! You’ll\nsee just how strong my team can be![VAR 0114(0149)]
Come on—let’s battle before the rain stops. You’ll\nsee just how strong my team can be![VAR 0114(0149)]

No, I’ve got to go[VAR 0114(0149)]

I don’t want to get soaked...[VAR 0114(0149)]

Now my team’s moves are all powered up! Water\ntypes and rain are the best combo—you’ll see![VAR 0114(0149)]
[~ 20]
Wow, I couldn’t win even though the rain gave my\nWater-type team an advantage.[VAR 0114(0149)]

Well, Water-type moves become more powerful in\nthe rain! That’s why I thought I could win...[VAR 0114(0149)]
You know what else, though?[VAR 0114(0149)]
Fire-type moves become weaker in the rain.[VAR 0114(0149)]
It makes sense, really. Rain makes things wet,\nand wet things are tough to burn![VAR 0114(0149)]

You want to know what I’m doing? Well, I’m\nfeeding these wild Aron![VAR 0114(014D)]
Aron love to eat metal—they’ll even munch away\nat cars and things if you’re not careful.[VAR 0114(014D)]
So I feed them scrap metal to make sure they\ndon’t start eating what they shouldn’t.[VAR 0114(014D)]
I do worry they’ll get bored if I keep feeding them\nthe same old thing all the time, though.[VAR 0114(014D)]
And so I had an idea![VAR 0114(014D)]
Don’t you think a Poison-type move would add\nsome really nice flavor to scrap metal?[VAR 0114(014D)]
Steel-type Pokémon can’t be poisoned, so it won’t\nbother them at all![VAR 0114(014D)]
If you’re happy to help me test my idea, hit that\npile of scrap metal with the move [VAR FF00(0006)]Sludge Bomb[VAR FF00(0000)]\r\nto give it some seasoning, please![VAR 0114(014D)]

Oooh! That Sludge Bomb gave the scrap metal\nsuch a tantalizing aroma![VAR 0114(014D)]

Thank you for spicing things up for us. You were\na fantastic help, and I’m fantastically grateful![VAR 0114(014D)]
After this, I think I’ll spend some time researching\nwhich Poison-type moves Aron find the tastiest.[VAR 0114(014D)]
Don’t you worry, my little Aron friends! I’ll keep\nfeeding you as much scrap metal as you like.[VAR 0114(014D)]
[~ 23]
Boring old scrap metal can be turned into a tasty\ntreat, thanks to Poison-type moves!\c\nAron are Steel types, so I don’t need to worry\nabout them getting poisoned.[VAR 0114(014D)]
Skreee!
Grrruf!

H-hello, [VAR 1100(00FF,0503)]sirma’am! Would you like a ride anywhere?[VAR 0114(014E)]
It’s actually my first day on the job, and I haven’t\ngotten a single passenger yet.[VAR 0114(014E)]
I’ve practiced plenty! I know what I’m doing! But\nI’ll be pretty nervous until I get used to things...[VAR 0114(014E)]
So please! Help me out here!\c\nLet me drive you somewhere—I promise I won’t\ncharge you anything![VAR 0114(014E)]
Tell me whenever you’re ready to put the pedal to\nthe metal![VAR 0114(014E)]
[~ 6]
Where can I take you in my taxi?[VAR 0114(014E)]
No problem
No thanks
But...but you’d be doing me such a big favor!\nPlease, please let me take you somewhere![VAR 0114(014E)]
Thank you so much! Gosh, my first-ever fare—\neven if I’m not charging you anything![VAR 0114(014E)]
Magenta Pokémon Center
Oh... I’m not sure I can find any of those... Could\nyou maybe choose a different destination?[VAR 0114(014E)]
A-all right! Then let’s get going![VAR 0114(014E)]
[~ 15]
I guess having only one destination makes this a\none-of-a-kind cab, don’t you think?[VAR 0114(014E)]
Sorry if I sound flippant. I know I should be able\nto find more than one place without getting lost...[VAR 0114(014E)]
Um... Oh! You know the strawberry tarts at Café\nPokémon-Amie? I love those. They’re great.[VAR 0114(014E)]
Oh. Sorry... I guess I shouldn’t just talk about\nmyself and what I like, huh...[VAR 0114(014E)]
It’s sure gotten tough to drive through town with\nall these wild Pokémon everywhere, huh?[VAR 0114(014E)]
I bet that makes you want to ask why I bothered\nbecoming a taxi driver in the first place, right?[VAR 0114(014E)]
GAH!!![VAR 0114(014E)]
S-sorry. I missed a turn. We’re going to have to\ncircle back around now...[VAR 0114(014E)]
Um, right, so I was explaining why I became a taxi\ndriver.[VAR 0114(014E)]
AH!!![VAR 0114(014E)]
That’s it! There! We’ve arrived at your destination,\n[VAR 1100(00FF,0503)]sirma’am: the Magenta Pokémon Center!\c\nAs promised, you don’t owe me a thing.[VAR 0114(014E)]
Thanks for the ride
No, I’ll pay like normal
No, no, I’m the one who should be thanking you!\nI appreciate you taking a chance on me![VAR 0114(014E)]
R-really...? But you don’t have to...\c\nWell, if you insist, then that’ll be 710, please.[VAR 0114(014E)]
R-really...? But you don’t have to...\c\nWell, if you insist, then that’ll be 710, please.\c\nWait, you don’t even have that much anyway...[VAR 0114(014E)]
[~ 32]
Well, my first fare taught me a lot. Like how far\nI’ve still got to go before I’m a true pro...[VAR 0114(014E)]
I got lost on the streets, got lost in conversation,\nand I think I totally lost your trust by the end...[VAR 0114(014E)]
But I do have one area where I’m still confident I\ncan impress you: Pokémon battles! How about it?[VAR 0114(014E)]
Please! You were my first-ever fare. Now let me\npay you back with a rewarding battle![VAR 0114(014E)]
Sure, why not?
I’d rather not...
Great! I’ll show you that I’m not so hopeless at\neverything I do![VAR 0114(014E)]
Oh, please reconsider! I really want to show you\nmy skills![VAR 0114(014E)]
[~ 41]
OK, it turns out that battle taught me how far I’ve\nstill got to go as a Trainer too...[VAR 0114(014E)]
But that doesn’t mean it wasn’t fun! I really\nenjoyed battling with you![VAR 0114(014E)]
I’m glad I’ve never given up on Pokémon battling.\nI’m not the best, but it still gives me confidence.[VAR 0114(014E)]
And if I don’t give up as a taxi driver, I bet I’ll build\nup confidence over time there too.\c\nAs long as, um, I don’t lose my job or anything.[VAR 0114(014E)]
Thank you again for being my first-ever fare—and\nfor the great battle today![VAR 0114(014E)]

When a Pokémon flinches, it can’t fire off the\nmove it was about to use![VAR 0114(014F)]
If your Pokémon is able to attack as normal, but\nyour opponent’s Pokémon can’t attack at all...\r\nit’s basically like attacking TWICE![VAR 0114(014F)]
My battle style is all about making victory a cinch\nby causing the opposing Pokémon to flinch!\c\nIf you want to face me, you’d best prepare for a\ntough fight![VAR 0114(014F)]
Come talk to me when you feel ready![VAR 0114(014F)]
[~ 5]
A flinching Pokémon won’t be able to execute the\nmove it wanted to use!\c\nWill you face me even though you know how\ntough it must be to win against my strategy?[VAR 0114(014F)]
I’ll face you!
Maybe not...
Looks like you flinched before your Pokémon even\nhad the chance to do so.[VAR 0114(014F)]
Heh. I like your unflinching resolve![VAR 0114(014F)]
[~ 11]
I guess it doesn’t matter whether you flinch\nor not...\c\nBeing a Pokémon Trainer is all about clinching\nvictory your own way![VAR 0114(014F)]
Your mental resolve during that battle can only be\ndescribed as [VAR 1100(00FF,0806)]kinglymajestic!\c\nAs such, I think this is just the reward for you.[VAR 0114(014F)]
A Pokémon holding a King’s Rock will sometimes\nmake opponents flinch with its attacks.[VAR 0114(014F)]
Go seize the upper hand by putting opponents in\na tough spot! I expect great things from you![VAR 0114(014F)]

I’m using the power of metronomes to see every\nsingle Pokémon move there is![VAR 0114(0150)]
...Come again?
Sounds neat!
Maybe you don’t get what I mean—or maybe you\ndo? Well, either way, allow me to explain.\c\nThe move Metronome causes a Pokémon to use a\ncompletely random move![VAR 0114(0150)]
You’ll understand best if you see it for yourself!\nSo let’s have ourselves a battle![VAR 0114(0150)]
Just let me know if you’d like to battle me![VAR 0114(0150)]
[~ 7]
Feel like trying your luck against the random\nmoves brought out by Metronome?[VAR 0114(0150)]
Yep—I’m feeling lucky!
I won’t chance it...
Yeah, I guess it’s scary to think you might end up\non the wrong end of a superpowerful move![VAR 0114(0150)]
Even I have no idea which moves Metronome will\nunleash. Let’s see whose luck wins out![VAR 0114(0150)]
[~ 13]
Tick-tock-tick-tock![VAR 0114(0150)]
You might think I lost just now, but that’s not\ntrue!\c\nAfter all, I got to see a move I’d never seen before![VAR 0114(0150)]
Isn’t it amazing that Pokémon can stimulate their\nbrains by wagging a finger like a metronome, and\r\nthat this allows them to use all sorts of moves?\c\nPokémon really can do just about anything![VAR 0114(0150)]
But you know, I hear there are certain moves that\ncan’t be used through Metronome.\c\nI guess that means I’ll have to keep battling until\nI find out what they are! We’ll be wagging our\r\nfingers so much, it’ll generate shock waves![VAR 0114(0150)]
I hope you’ll keep using Metronome to discover\nlots of different moves, too![VAR 0114(0150)]

I’m not like everyone else, and I’ve got unusual\nPokémon in my team to prove it!\c\nBattle me, and you’ll find out exactly what I mean.[VAR 0114(0151)]

Are you ready to battle my unusual Pokémon?[VAR 0114(0151)]
Let’s go, kid!
I’m not feeling it
You say that, but I can tell—you really are itching\nto see my unusual Pokémon, aren’t you?[VAR 0114(0151)]
Then feast your eyes on some Pokémon you won’t\never find here in Lumiose![VAR 0114(0151)]
[~ 8]
I met my Pokémon on vacation last year. You can\nonly find them in Galar—pretty cool, huh?[VAR 0114(0151)]
Galarian Slowpoke all live on this place called the\nIsle of Armor, and they smell kinda spicy from all\r\nthe Galarica they eat. It’s so weird![VAR 0114(0151)]
And they evolve when you give them accessories\nmade from Galarica Twigs! Isn’t that strange?[VAR 0114(0151)]
Those twigs are found on the Isle of Armor. You\nhave no idea how many I had to gather to evolve\r\nmy Slowpoke...[VAR 0114(0151)]
Maybe I wasn’t able to show off the power of my\nGalarian Pokémon, but they’re still my precious\r\npartners. Meeting them was the best thing ever![VAR 0114(0151)]

Hello there! Have you ever wanted your Pokémon\nto heal themselves even while they attack\r\nopponents in a Pokémon battle?[VAR 0114(0152)]
Well, I’ve got good news for you—there are moves\nthat let you do just that! Some moves actually\r\nabsorb HP from the opponent![VAR 0114(0152)]
Care to experience the effects yourself? Your\nPokémon will have their HP drained while my\r\nPokémon are healed! Imagine the horror![VAR 0114(0152)]
Let me know if you’re ready to face the terror of\nhaving your HP drained in battle![VAR 0114(0152)]

Your Pokémon will have their HP drained while\nmy Pokémon are healed! Care to experience the\r\nhorror firsthand?[VAR 0114(0152)]
Let me experience it!
No horror for me...
Oh, come on! It’s just a little HP! It’s not like you’ll\nmiss it!\c\nWell...you might, actually.[VAR 0114(0152)]
Heh heh! Time to drain some HP![VAR 0114(0152)]
[~ 11]
It’s not quite so easy to win if your opponents are\nhealing as they attack you, is it?[VAR 0114(0152)]
Then again, that didn’t stop you from winning,\nclearly![VAR 0114(0152)]
And to think, I even had all my Pokémon equipped\nwith Big Roots...[VAR 0114(0152)]
Big Roots are items that allow Pokémon to absorb\nmore HP! Here, let me give you one too.[VAR 0114(0152)]
Once you discover the fun of healing while\nattacking, it really sucks you in![VAR 0114(0152)]

Hmm... This Holovator’s refusing to work.[VAR 0114(0154)]
Maybe it’s not getting enough power...[VAR 0114(0154)]
I bet a good blast from an extra-shocking move\nwould get it up and running. If only I had a\r\nzap-tastic Pokémon like Canari’s Eelektross...[VAR 0114(0154)]

The Holovator’s low on ELECTRIC power! You\ncan’t just hit it with any old Pokémon move![VAR 0114(0154)]

It must be ’cause you hit it with that zap-tastic\nmove![VAR 0114(0154)]
I was in a real bind since I didn’t know how I’d\nprovide that power. Guess my work here is done![VAR 0114(0154)]
Well, go on! If you want to use the Holovator, it’s\nall yours![VAR 0114(0154)]

Oh, I know! Why don’t you and I have a Pokémon\nbattle?[VAR 0114(0155)]
If I can have a battle, that’ll be enough of a break\nfor me. I’ll get right back to work afterward![VAR 0114(0155)]
Just give me a heads-up if you want to battle.[VAR 0114(0155)]
[~ 8]
I promise I’ll get the Holovator up and running in\nno time if you’ll have a battle with me![VAR 0114(0155)]
I’ll win in no time!

Shame. Guess I’ll just have to take a nice, long\nbreak to unwind.[VAR 0114(0155)]
Great, I was in the mood for a battle! Let’s get\ngoing![VAR 0114(0155)]
Oh, come on—no one can expect me to fix that\nHolovator if it’s stuck in a battle zone![VAR 0114(0155)]

That was a fun battle! Guess it’s time for me to\nwrap up my break.[VAR 0114(0155)]
Now then, let me get the Holovator all fixed up.\nIt won’t take a minute![VAR 0114(0155)]
Aaand I’m done! The Holovator’s up and running.[VAR 0114(0155)]
You know the Pokémon I used in our battle?\nI caught them all up on the rooftops![VAR 0114(0155)]
I ran into ’em all while I was on the job too!\c\nI got so focused on catching them, I almost\nmissed break time![VAR 0114(0155)]
My point is, you can find all sorts of Pokémon on\nthe rooftops around the city. You should have a\r\nlook around next time you’re up there.[VAR 0114(0155)]

I think a wild Pokémon’s made its nest there.[VAR 0114(0156)]

Could you chase that Pokémon away? I feel a little\nbad for it, but we don’t really have a choice...[VAR 0114(0156)]

Do you think you could chase away the Pokémon\nthat made its nest in front of the Holovator?[VAR 0114(0156)]

A wild Pokémon has made its nest here. Do you\nwant to battle it and chase it away?
I’ll chase it away
I’ll leave it be
The Pokémon leaped out at you!
DIIIIIIG!!!
[~ 16]
So that nest belonged to a Diggersby, huh?[VAR 0114(0156)]
That makes sense, actually. A Diggersby probably\ncould dig its way here from a wild zone.[VAR 0114(0156)]
Anyway, thanks for sorting that out! Now we can\nall use the Holovator![VAR 0114(0156)]
Don’t worry about Diggersby’s hole. I filled it up\nwhile you were battling![VAR 0114(0156)]

I’ve heard of Trainers settling arguments WITH\nPokémon, but BETWEEN Pokémon? Wow![VAR 0114(0158)]
Y’know, maybe those two were getting territorial\nover the Holovator because they were drawn to\r\nthe electricity that powers it.[VAR 0114(0158)]

Phew... I caught all four of the Beldum, and now\nwe can get back to work![VAR 0114(0159)]
Check it out! Remember those Beldum I caught?\nThey evolved into these Metang!\c\nI can’t imagine repairin’ Holovators without my\nhandy little helpers here.[VAR 0114(0159)]
Hey, look at this! Those Beldum I caught have\nfinally evolved all the way into a Metagross!\c\nI can’t believe how big it got... And it still can’t get\nenough of my Holovator repair work![VAR 0114(0159)]

Not again... This thing just won’t work...
[~ 2]
This Holovator’s been on the fritz recently...[VAR 0114(015A)]
I can usually get it up and running again with a\nwell-placed punch or two...but not this time.\r\nMaybe it needs a bigger wallop than I can give.[VAR 0114(015A)]
Looks like we’re going to need a Pokémon’s help\nto kick this thing into action![VAR 0114(015A)]
Pokémon have two categories of attacking moves,\nyou know: physical and special.\c\nYou can check a move’s category from the same\nscreen you’d use to change a Pokémon’s moves.\c\nThe icon for physical moves will look like a burst\nof spikes—that’s what we’re looking for![VAR 0114(015A)]
If a Pokémon gave this Holovator a wallop with a\nFighting-type physical move, I think that’d fix it![VAR 0114(015A)]
[~ 8]
If a Pokémon hits this Holovator with a Fighting-\ntype physical move, that should get it working![VAR 0114(015A)]
[~ 10]
No, that won’t work. We need to hit the Holovator\nwith a Fighting-type physical move![VAR 0114(015A)]
Oh! It’s working again![VAR 0114(015A)]
I knew a Fighting-type physical move would do it!\nNothing like a good thwack to fix things up![VAR 0114(015A)]
You sure this machine’s OK?
That seems a bit...violent
It’s fiiine! Trust me![VAR 0114(015A)]
This is how we fix all our electrical appliances at\nthe dojo![VAR 0114(015A)]
Anyway, thanks a bunch! This Holovator would’ve\nbeen stuck without you![VAR 0114(015A)]

You know, Ivor-sensei would have just chucked\nme up to the roof.[VAR 0114(015A)]

Oh man, I’ve thought up the best idea for a new\nbusiness! Heheh. Just you wait and see!
[~ 2]
Heheh. Did you know you can get into the sewers\nfrom here?[VAR 0114(015B)]
I’ve actually been thinking of a sweet new\nbusiness venture I could start down there.[VAR 0114(015B)]
You just watch—with Camerupt at my side, this\nscheme is gonna be hotter than hot![VAR 0114(015B)]
Fwaaaf!
But I need help from someone like you. I’ll reward\nyou for the work, don’t you worry.[VAR 0114(015B)]
I’ll leave the gate unlocked for you.\c\nCome join me inside...but make sure you’re ready\nfor anything![VAR 0114(015B)]
[~ 9]
Heheh. So you’ve come.[VAR 0114(015B)]
What do you think? Isn’t this place just perfect?\nSo dark and humid and secluded?[VAR 0114(015B)]
I did warn you to only show up if you were ready\nfor anything, so...I hope you came ready to battle![VAR 0114(015B)]
I want to see you get my Camerupt all fired up![VAR 0114(015B)]
Give me a shout when you’re ready.[VAR 0114(015B)]
[~ 15]
I want to see you get my Camerupt all fired up![VAR 0114(015B)]
Sure, I can battle it
I’d really rather not
Disappointing... I thought you had more fire\nin you.[VAR 0114(015B)]
That’s what I wanted to hear! I’ll meet your\nburning enthusiasm with a fiery battle![VAR 0114(015B)]
[~ 21]
Good... Even without winning that match, things\nare starting to get nice and hot in here.\c\nThis is just what I need to start my very own...[VAR 0114(015B)]
CAMERUPT SAUNA![VAR 0114(015B)]
I’ll use the 18,000-degree magma that’s stored in\nCamerupt’s humps to warm this whole room.[VAR 0114(015B)]
It’ll produce perfectly heated water vapor for the\nultimate in steam saunas: the Camerupt sauna!\c\nIt’s the perfect business idea![VAR 0114(015B)]
You want to do that...down here?
Way down deep in the sewers?
You...may have a point.[VAR 0114(015B)]
While it’s true that this chamber is perfectly\nsuited to creating a steam sauna, customers may\r\nhave a hard time getting all the way down here.[VAR 0114(015B)]
Scraaahhh!
No way, there are wild Pokémon down here too?[VAR 0114(015B)]
Skreek! Skreek!
They seem pretty happy—comfortable, even—in\nthis nice, moist heat...[VAR 0114(015B)]
Wait. Maybe THEY could use a Camerupt sauna?![VAR 0114(015B)]
Well, all right then![VAR 0114(015B)]
I’ll make this a wild, wild Camerupt sauna for all\nthe wild Pokémon down here to enjoy![VAR 0114(015B)]

Since you helped my Scyther master its cutting\nskills, I think you’d make a worthy challenger![VAR 0114(0142)]
Just as the Kalos region has the Pokémon\nLeague...[VAR 0114(0142)]
Lumiose City has the Furfrou League![VAR 0114(0142)]
The Furfrou League is where this city’s most\nskilled Furfrou fans compete to see who has\r\nthe strongest Furfrou.[VAR 0114(0142)]
Four such Trainers—known as the Elite Four—are\nawaiting a worthy challenger.[VAR 0114(0142)]
The Elite Four can be found in four different\nrestaurants around Lumiose.[VAR 0114(0142)]
If you want to battle them, make sure you have\nonly Furfrou on your team.[VAR 0114(0142)]
Sounds like a fun challenge, no? Try beating them\nall, if you can![VAR 0114(0142)]
[~ 9]
I’m Mie, a member of the Furfrou League’s Elite\nFour. I use Kabuki Trim Furfrou![VAR 0114(015C)]
If you want to face me, make sure you have only\nFurfrou on your team.[VAR 0114(015C)]
Will you battle me and discover the beauty and\ncharm of the Kabuki Trim for yourself?[VAR 0114(015C)]
I’ll face you
Hold on a bit
Hmph. I hope you will reconsider so that my\nFurfrou and I can show off, as appropriate.[VAR 0114(015C)]
Then let this battle decide which Furfrou trim\nstands atop the rest![VAR 0114(015C)]
[~ 17]
The word “kabuki” comes from a word meaning\n“out of the ordinary.”\c\nAnd what could be more out of the ordinary than\nfor my Furfrou to be defeated?[VAR 0114(015C)]
But this does not mean the defeat of the Furfrou\nElite Four![VAR 0114(015C)]
You still have to face...[VAR 0200(0002)] Trainer[VAR 1101(0002,0100)]s![VAR 0114(015C)]
With that, you have bested the Furfrou Elite Four.\nBut you have not conquered the Furfrou League!\c\nHead to Café Woof. You will see what I mean.[VAR 0114(015C)]
[~ 22]
The word “kabuki” comes from a word meaning\n“out of the ordinary.”\c\nAnd what could be more out of the ordinary than\nfor my Furfrou to be defeated?[VAR 0114(015C)]

I’m Brill, a member of the Furfrou League’s Elite\nFour. My specialty is Star Trim Furfrou![VAR 0114(015D)]
Make sure you have only Furfrou on your team if\nyou want to face me![VAR 0114(015D)]
Let’s battle to see whose Furfrou can shine the\nbrightest![VAR 0114(015D)]
I’ll face you
Hold on a bit
I’ll wait as long as you need to polish your Furfrou\nto a nice sparkle.[VAR 0114(015D)]
Let’s see whose Furfrou shines more brilliantly![VAR 0114(015D)]
[~ 32]
There’s no denying it... Your Furfrou is truly\nbrilliant![VAR 0114(015D)]
But I’m not the last Elite Four member waiting for\nyou in the Furfrou League.[VAR 0114(015D)]
You still need to face...[VAR 0200(0002)] Trainer[VAR 1101(0002,0100)]s![VAR 0114(015D)]
With that, you’ve triumphed over the Elite Four.\nBut the Furfrou League isn’t yet defeated!\c\nHead to Café Woof. You’ll find answers there.[VAR 0114(015D)]
[~ 37]
There’s no denying it... Your Furfrou is truly\nbrilliant![VAR 0114(015D)]
[~ 39]
I am Diamant, the Diamond Trim Furfrou user of\nthe esteemed Furfrou Elite Four.[VAR 0114(015E)]
I believe the conditions were clear, my young\nfriend. You must have only Furfrou on your team.[VAR 0114(015E)]
You brought only Furfrou. Good. Now let us see if\nyou can even scratch my Furfrou’s noble coat![VAR 0114(015E)]
I’ll face you
Hold on a bit
If you’re to face the unbreakable nobility of the\nDiamond Trim, be sure to prepare yourself well.[VAR 0114(015E)]
Then behold the Diamond Trim’s unbreakable\nmagnificence![VAR 0114(015E)]
[~ 47]
Alas, you now know the truth... A Diamond Trim\ndoesn’t actually raise a Furfrou’s defenses...[VAR 0114(015E)]
But I remain unbothered by my defeat. Whoever\nremains in the Elite Four will surely avenge me.[VAR 0114(015E)]
You must still face...[VAR 0200(0002)] Trainer[VAR 1101(0002,0100)]s![VAR 0114(015E)]
With that, you have bested every member of the\nElite Four. But the Furfrou League isn’t finished!\c\nMake your way to Café Woof—there you will find\nout exactly what I mean.[VAR 0114(015E)]
[~ 52]
Alas, you now know the truth... A Diamond Trim\ndoesn’t actually raise a Furfrou’s defenses...[VAR 0114(015E)]

I’m Marta, the Matron Trim user of the Furfrou\nElite Four![VAR 0114(015F)]
You know the rules. If you wish to face us, you\nmust do so with only Furfrou on your team.[VAR 0114(015F)]
Let’s have a sublime battle to determine who has\nthe absolute best Furfrou.[VAR 0114(015F)]
I’ll face you
Hold on a bit
How disappointing...[VAR 0114(015F)]
Then we shall battle fair and square![VAR 0114(015F)]
[~ 62]
I do wish you could show a little more respect to\nyour elders in battle.[VAR 0114(015F)]
But you are not done. I am but one member of the\nFurfrou Elite Four, after all.[VAR 0114(015F)]
There [VAR 1101(0002,0302)]isare still...[VAR 0200(0002)] Trainer[VAR 1101(0002,0100)]s remaining![VAR 0114(015F)]
You have defeated every member of the Furfrou\nElite Four. It is time for you to visit Café Woof.[VAR 0114(015F)]
[~ 67]
You have bested me... I therefore forbid you to be\ndefeated by anybody else![VAR 0114(015F)]
[~ 69]
Congratulations on defeating every member of the\nFurfrou Elite Four.[VAR 0114(0160)]
However, the Furfrou League has not yet been\ncompletely defeated.[VAR 0114(0160)]
For the Furfrou Champion—the pinnacle of the\nFurfrou League—still remains![VAR 0114(0160)]
My name is Soignée. I am the current Furfrou\nChampion.\c\nDefeat me, and you will secure your position at\nthe top of the Furfrou League.[VAR 0114(0160)]
As always, the only condition to face me is that\nyou must have only Furfrou in your team.[VAR 0114(0160)]
Can you defeat me and my six perfectly-trimmed\nFurfrou, I wonder?[VAR 0114(0160)]
[~ 76]
This will be your final battle. The winner shall be\nthe Furfrou Champion![VAR 0114(0160)]
But...the battle for the top of the Furfrou League\ncan only be decided by Furfrou, as I stated before.\c\nReturn to me when you have only Furfrou on your\nteam.[VAR 0114(0160)]
Prove to me that your love for Furfrou is deep\nenough to lead our league of Furfrou fans![VAR 0114(0160)]
I’ll prove it by defeating you!
Give me just a moment
Hah... Take as long as you need.[VAR 0114(0160)]
It’s your love of Furfrou against mine! And only\ntrue passion will triumph![VAR 0114(0160)]
[~ 84]
[VAR BD06(0000)]As of now...no one in Lumiose can claim to love\nFurfrou as much as you,\r\n[VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0160)]
Congratulations to our new Furfrou Champion![VAR 0114(0160)]
Yes, congratulations.[VAR 0114(0142)]
Are you thinking what I’m thinking, Soignée?\c\nIt feels like things are finally back to how they\nwere, doesn’t it?[VAR 0114(0142)]
Indeed... I remember when the disaster five years\nago forced Lumiose’s Furfrou trimming salon,\r\nFriseur Furfrou, to close up shop.[VAR 0114(0160)]
It broke the heart of every Furfrou fan in Lumiose.\nWe feared we would never again be able to try out\r\nnew trims for our beloved Furfrou.[VAR 0114(0160)]
But then, a savior came to our city.[VAR 0114(0160)]
That’s you![VAR 0114(0142)]
Mirte and her Scyther were struggling to learn\nhow to properly trim Furfrou.[VAR 0114(0160)]
Not only did you assist them, but now you also\nstand at the top of the Furfrou League![VAR 0114(0160)]
You truly are an inspiration to us all. Perhaps your\nachievements will even prompt the creation of\r\nnew leagues to celebrate other Pokémon species.\c\nA Spewpa League, maybe...or a Binacle League![VAR 0114(0160)]
I hope you show us your love for Pokémon in each\nand every one of the new leagues that appear![VAR 0114(0160)]
I’m not sure if all that will happen, but I do hope\nyou’ll stop by whenever you want to give your\r\nFurfrou a trim![VAR 0114(0142)]

In the Society of Battle Connoisseurs, most\nTrainers use Fairy-type Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0161)]
But some of us in the society adore Dragon types\ntoo![VAR 0114(0161)]
As I’m sure you’re aware, Dragon-type Pokémon\nare weak to Dragon-, Ice-, and Fairy-type moves.[VAR 0114(0161)]
Battling with Dragon types in the Fairy-loving SBC\nleaves you forever in a disadvantaged position.[VAR 0114(0161)]
It’s rather like the relationship between Jacinthe\nand Lebanne...[VAR 0114(0161)]
Oh, but those two really do suit each other, so...\nplease forget I mentioned anything.[VAR 0114(0161)]
I’m afraid I’ve sidetracked us a bit. Let me get to\nmy point.[VAR 0114(0161)]
I’d like you to battle my beloved Dragon-type\nPokémon to help them grow strong![VAR 0114(0161)]
Just let me know whenever you decide you would\nlike to battle.[VAR 0114(0161)]
[~ 10]
You’ll do me the favor of battling my Dragon types,\nwon’t you?[VAR 0114(0161)]
I sure will!
I sure won’t
Wh-whyever not?![VAR 0114(0161)]
Be warned—my Pokémon are holding Dragon\nFangs, so their attacks will have some real bite![VAR 0114(0161)]
[~ 16]
Well...my Pokémon can still evolve yet.\c\nAs I mentioned earlier, it’s no easy task raising\nDragon types in the SBC.[VAR 0114(0161)]
I have my Pokémon hold Dragon Fangs to power\nup their attacks, but the struggle continues.[VAR 0114(0161)]
I should have known the winner of Le Super-\nTournoi de Jacinthe would be so strong.[VAR 0114(0161)]
Since my Pokémon aren’t fully evolved, perhaps I\nought to have given them Eviolite to hold instead.[VAR 0114(0161)]
But I was persuaded by Lebanne’s motto:\n“The best defense is a good offense.”[VAR 0114(0161)]
Though Lebanne can hardly talk—she can’t ever\nseem to win against Jacinthe.\c\nPerhaps she should rethink that motto of hers...[VAR 0114(0161)]
In any case, I’d like you to have this Dragon Fang.\nThank you very much for today.[VAR 0114(0161)]

Ahem. Could you tell I was doing an impression\nof my favorite Trainer?\c\nShe uses Ice-type Pokémon, so I do too![VAR 0114(0162)]
How about it, then?\c\nWant to have a chilling battle against my\nIce types?[VAR 0114(0162)]
If being chilled to the bone sounds like your\nthing, let me know![VAR 0114(0162)]

Are you up for a battle against my Ice-type team?[VAR 0114(0162)]
Yeah!
No, thanks
That’s fair—being overly cold does you no good.\nLet me know if you change your mind, though![VAR 0114(0162)]
Then it’s time for another iconic quote from my\nfavorite Trainer! Ahem.[VAR 0114(0162)]
“Hahaha! Are you ready?”[VAR 0114(0162)]
[~ 13]
“You’re better than I thought!\c\n“Go on ahead!”[VAR 0114(0162)]
Hm... Maybe I’m going a bit overboard with the\nquotes.[VAR 0114(0162)]
Anyway, you’re real strong!\c\nA little tip from me—don’t worry too much if your\nPokémon get frozen. They’ll thaw on their own.[VAR 0114(0162)]
Or you can always use Flame Wheel, Steam\nEruption, or Flare Blitz to melt the ice if your\r\nPokémon knows one of those moves![VAR 0114(0162)]
Y’know, it’s so strange and incredible that there’s\na place like this in Lumiose. It’s like an ice field![VAR 0114(0162)]
Now that there are more wild Pokémon around\nthe city, we can enjoy all sorts of new things!\c\nSpeaking of which, I can’t wait to go enjoy an\nice-cold granita with my Ice-type Pokémon![VAR 0114(0162)]

I can tell just by looking at you that you’re a\nstrong Pokémon Trainer.[VAR 0114(0163)]
To defeat a Trainer like you, it’s necessary to go all\nin on a single strategy!\c\nSo I’ll be attacking you with my favorite of all\nPokémon types: the Bug type![VAR 0114(0163)]
Being dedicated to a single thing you love forces\nyou to be creative to overcome its weaknesses,\r\nand that creativity leads to true strength!\c\nYou should battle me and see for yourself![VAR 0114(0163)]
If you care for a battle, ready yourself and then say\nthe word![VAR 0114(0163)]
[~ 5]
Come on! Battle me and my Bug-type Pokémon!\nPlease?[VAR 0114(0163)]
I’ll battle you
Nah, I’m good
Whaaat? C’mon! Bug types have so many\nweaknesses you can exploit—Fire, Rock, Flying...[VAR 0114(0163)]
Just to warn you, I’ll be using Mega Evolution to\ndraw out the potential of my beloved bugs![VAR 0114(0163)]
[~ 11]
Good work out there, team—especially Pinsir!\nGreat job with that Mega Evolution![VAR 0114(0163)]
Seems like more and more Trainers are using\nMega Evolution lately, huh?[VAR 0114(0163)]
I’ve heard rumors—though they’re just rumors,\nmind you—that some shady character taught\r\nQuasartico how to make Mega Rings.\c\nApparently, that person’s name is...AZ.[VAR 0114(0163)]
Wow, I never would’ve known!
Boy, what an interesting rumor
The story goes that this AZ person traveled all the\nway to some far-off region called Hoenn.\c\nThere, he researched the origins of Mega\nEvolution to satisfy his own curiosity.[VAR 0114(0163)]
It seems he shared his research with Quasartico.\nBut what does he hope to achieve?[VAR 0114(0163)]
I guess I’ve got no complaints as long as I can\nMega Evolve my beloved Pokémon!\c\nWe should all just appreciate this precious gift\nthat we have.[VAR 0114(0163)]

You know, I’ve come to a certain conclusion when\nit comes to Pokémon types.[VAR 0114(0164)]
It’s that Normal is the greatest type![VAR 0114(0164)]
After all, Normal-type Pokémon have almost no\nweaknesses.[VAR 0114(0164)]
Using Normal types basically sets you up to have\nan advantage against any other opponent![VAR 0114(0164)]
I’ve traveled all over this world and battled against\nall kinds of Pokémon, so I know what I’m saying.[VAR 0114(0164)]
How about I prove my theory to you in battle?[VAR 0114(0164)]
When you’re ready to help me prove that I’m\nright, say the word.[VAR 0114(0164)]
[~ 8]
I’m going to prove to you that Normal types are\nthe greatest of all. You ready for that?[VAR 0114(0164)]
I’m ready
Not yet
Fine. You’ll need to prepare if you hope to win.[VAR 0114(0164)]
My Pokémon are all Normal-type Pokémon! They\nshould beat any other type you throw at them![VAR 0114(0164)]
[~ 14]
I guess it’s unavoidable that a Trainer has to care\nabout type matchups, after all...[VAR 0114(0164)]
But you see...[VAR 0114(0164)]
I just can’t remember them all! There are too\nmany types and combinations! It’s impossible![VAR 0114(0164)]
Come on, admit it. You haven’t memorized every\npossible type matchup either, have you?[VAR 0114(0164)]
I know them all by heart
Um, well, not exactly...
Then you really are one amazing Trainer![VAR 0114(0164)]
That’s what I thought. None of us have![VAR 0114(0164)]
But I think I’ll stick with Normal types.\c\nThey may not be the greatest, but at least they’re\nadaptable to all kinds of situations![VAR 0114(0164)]
Though there is one type that Normal-type moves\nare completely ineffective against...\c\nThe dreaded Ghost type![VAR 0114(0164)]
If only Normal-type moves worked on Ghost types\nthen my team would be ready for any opponent![VAR 0114(0164)]

If only Normal-type moves worked against Ghost-\ntype Pokémon... *sigh*[VAR 0114(0164)]

Ghost-type Pokémon are weak to Dark-type\nmoves...and Ghost-type moves. Do you know what\r\nthat means?[VAR 0114(0165)]
Sure do
No clue
In a battle between Ghost types, speed plays a\nlarge part in determining the outcome...[VAR 0114(0165)]
So what say we have a battle to decide which of\nus is the superior Ghost-type user?[VAR 0114(0165)]
Once you and your Ghost-type Pokémon are\nready, please let me know.[VAR 0114(0165)]
[~ 7]
Be sure to only bring Ghost-type Pokémon for our\nbattle.[VAR 0114(0165)]
Ready to see who’s the superior Ghost-type user?[VAR 0114(0165)]
Bring it on!
Maybe later
[VAR BD06(0000)]Huh? You brought a[VAR 1101(00FD,0800)] team of Ghost-type Pokémon\nlike I\r\nasked, but you’re not going to battle me?[VAR 0114(0165)]
Even if you surpass us in speed, I have a backup\nplan to bring us back from the brink![VAR 0114(0165)]
[~ 14]
I still lost...[VAR 0114(0165)]
Even my backup plan of giving my Pokémon Spell\nTags to strengthen their Ghost-type moves failed.[VAR 0114(0165)]
I know you helped Ivor and Gwynn bury the\nhatchet before, so your skill in battle shouldn’t\r\ncome as such a surpr—[VAR 0114(0165)]
Huh?![VAR 0114(0165)]
Do you...feel a chill in the air?[VAR 0114(0165)]
What?
Nope
You don’t feel it? This aura of melancholy...\c\nMaybe Gwynn’s Chandelure is mad over what I\njust said and now wants to absorb my spirit...[VAR 0114(0165)]
No, please, don’t punish me! I didn’t mean it! I\ntake it back! Please don’t take my spirit![VAR 0114(0165)]
Phew! The aura of melancholy is gone.[VAR 0114(0165)]
It seems talking about Ivor is off-limits even when\nGwynn’s not around...[VAR 0114(0165)]
Here, take this Spell Tag. Give it to a Pokémon to\nboost the power of its Ghost-type moves.[VAR 0114(0165)]

Well, if it ain’t that kid from Team MZ.[VAR 0114(001D)]
You got a bit of a reputation in the Rust Syndicate.\nI hear you’re pretty strong.[VAR 0114(001D)]
Battle me, will you? Don’t have to be right now—\nI can wait till you’re good and ready.[VAR 0114(001D)]
Come talk to me once you’re in the mood for a\nbattle, MZ grunt.[VAR 0114(001D)]
[~ 4]
You seem ready. Wanna get this started?[VAR 0114(001D)]
Let’s battle
Not right now
Then buckle up! My will is hard as steel, y’hear?[VAR 0114(001D)]
You messin’ with me, kid? If you ain’t ready to\nbattle, don’t talk to me in the first place![VAR 0114(001D)]
[~ 10]
Y’know, you’re all right. Most folks wouldn’t\nwaste time humorin’ me.[VAR 0114(001D)]
Guess I owe you somethin’ interesting since I lost\nthe battle. Lemme tell you a little secret.[VAR 0114(001D)]
Steel can’t be poisoned![VAR 0114(001D)]
See, that’s true even for people. Word is that back\nwhen he was young, our very own Philippe was\r\nawed by an even younger man—Corbeau.[VAR 0114(001D)]
The thing about Corbeau is that he’s charismatic,\ncharmin’, just downright intoxicatin’.\c\nAnd that’s rad! But it can work against him, too.[VAR 0114(001D)]
So Philippe looks to Skarmory as a reminder. It\nhelps him keep a level head and stops him from\r\njust blindly following Corbeau.[VAR 0114(001D)]
None of this is high-stakes intel, mind you, but I\nlike talkin’ about it anyway.\c\nIt’s ’cause our second-in-command has such a\nsolid head on his shoulders that grunts like us\r\ncan sleep easy.[VAR 0114(001D)]
Here, take this. Thanks for the battle, and for\nlistenin’ to me prattle on.[VAR 0114(001D)]
If Corbeau’s taken you under his wing, then that\nmakes us family, MZ grunt![VAR 0114(001D)]
[~ 20]
If Corbeau’s taken you under his wing, then that\nmakes us family, MZ grunt![VAR 0114(001D)]

Grandpa, my Honedge seems like it’s under the\nweather. I even took it to a Pokémon Center, but\r\nthat didn’t help...[VAR 0114(0166)]
Oh, I know what’s happened... Its cutting edge\nhas gotten dull![VAR 0114(001E)]
How do I fix it?[VAR 0114(0166)]
If you want to sharpen the Sword Pokémon\nHonedge, there’s only one thing you need...[VAR 0114(001E)]
Pupitar![VAR 0114(001E)]
What do you mean?![VAR 0114(0166)]
Pupitar’s body is incredibly solid—so solid that\nslashing at it will naturally sharpen Honedge’s\r\ncutting edge![VAR 0114(001E)]
I dunno about that... And besides, I don’t have a\nPupitar with me...[VAR 0114(0166)]
Oh! Hey, you! Do you have a Pupitar? Let me battle\nit with my Honedge![VAR 0114(0166)]
[~ 10]
Make sure you’ve only got a single Pupitar on\nyour team, then battle my Honedge and me![VAR 0114(0166)]
Slashing at Pupitar’s hard body will sharpen\nHonedge to perfection![VAR 0114(001E)]
[~ 13]
Hey, you have a Pupitar with you! Do you think\nyou could have it battle my Honedge?[VAR 0114(0166)]
I’ll battle you!
Not right now
Oh, that’s too bad...[VAR 0114(0166)]
Great! Let’s do this![VAR 0114(0166)]
[~ 19]
I guess that’s an L for us, Honedge. Here, let me\nheal you up.[VAR 0114(0166)]
Shreeen!
Huh? Honedge seems full of energy again! You\nwere right, Grandpa![VAR 0114(0166)]
Ho ho ho! I told you it’d work![VAR 0114(001E)]
Pupitar is the key![VAR 0114(001E)]
But this whole process is good for the Pupitar\ntoo, you know.[VAR 0114(001E)]
Testing its durability helps it feel more confident\nand lets it evolve without a worry![VAR 0114(001E)]
Not sure if I believe all that, but...[VAR 0114(0166)]
Honedge is back to its old self again! I guess we\nowe Pupitar for that![VAR 0114(0166)]
Thanks to you and Pupitar for helping me take\ncare of my Honedge![VAR 0114(0166)]
[~ 30]
I’m sure there are lots of Pokémon that help each\nother out in unexpected ways.[VAR 0114(001E)]

You know, healing Pokémon is a specialty of\nmine, working at a Pokémon Center and all.\r\nSo I decided to share my skills with my team![VAR 0114(0167)]
What I mean is that I taught my Pokémon moves\nthat can restore HP![VAR 0114(0167)]
Impressive, right? I wonder if a Trainer like you\ncould take on my self-healing team and win.[VAR 0114(0167)]
Tell me any time if you think you’d like to have a\nPokémon battle with me.[VAR 0114(0167)]
[~ 5]
Do you think you can take on my self-healing\nteam and win?[VAR 0114(0167)]
Absolutely!
Maybe not...
Well, if you don’t have confidence in your team’s\npower, it’s probably best not to push them.[VAR 0114(0167)]
Then taste the despair of watching your opponent\nrecover just when you thought you’d won![VAR 0114(0167)]
[~ 11]
What an overwhelming offense! And such\nmenacing tenacity![VAR 0114(0167)]
Of course, you can’t win by focusing only on\nrecovery.\c\nI made sure to keep that in mind when selecting\nmy team’s moves, yet here we are![VAR 0114(0167)]
I’ve got no choice but to admit how strong you\nare—and how weak I still am.[VAR 0114(0167)]
But I’m a Pokémon Center worker! My true skills\nlie in healing Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0167)]
So if you don’t mind, I’ll fix up my Pokémon’s\ninjuries right away![VAR 0114(0167)]
I have to admit: it’s a funny feeling to heal my\nown team like I do the teams of other Trainers![VAR 0114(0167)]
“Heliolisk and the rest of my team should be\nall better now!” Tee-hee![VAR 0114(0167)]
And of course I’ll be happy to heal your team any\ntime you stop by![VAR 0114(0167)]

In 30 seconds...[VAR 0114(0168)]
What’s going to happen then?
What are you talking about?
If you wish to know what 30 seconds can mean...\nbattle me and hear the song of my Pokémon...[VAR 0114(0168)]
Speak to me when you have prepared for battle.\nThen you shall know the truth of 30 seconds...[VAR 0114(0168)]
[~ 6]
If you wish to know what 30 seconds can mean...\nbattle me and hear the song of my Pokémon...[VAR 0114(0168)]
Sure, I’ll listen!
I’m good, thanks
What do you mean, you’re good? I can’t believe\nyou would make such a choice...[VAR 0114(0168)]
Then enjoy... Enjoy the sound...of Perish Song...[VAR 0114(0168)]
[~ 12]
Any Pokémon that hears Perish Song will faint\nafter 30 seconds...\c\nIncluding the Pokémon that sang the song, of\ncourse.[VAR 0114(0168)]
But fear not...[VAR 0114(0168)]
If you switch a different Pokémon into battle, the\nPokémon who heard Perish Song will not faint.[VAR 0114(0168)]
So, whenever you want to make your opponent\nleave the field...enjoy this 30-second trick...[VAR 0114(0168)]
Perish Song...\c\nA song of melancholy that causes any Pokémon\nwho hears it to faint after 30 seconds...[VAR 0114(0168)]

My Pikachu’s the strongest in the world![VAR 0114(0169)]
Pika!
Wanna know why he’s so strong? It’s because\nhe’s holding a Light Ball![VAR 0114(0169)]
A Light Ball makes a Pikachu’s Attack and Sp. Atk\neven stronger!\c\nThat’s why I’m confident my Pikachu is the\nstrongest in the whole world![VAR 0114(0169)]
If you have a Pikachu you think can beat mine,\nI’ll prove you wrong in battle![VAR 0114(0169)]
Let me know when you’re ready for a Pikachu\nversus Pikachu battle![VAR 0114(0169)]
[~ 7]
I wanna battle to see whose Pikachu is strongest!\c\nIf you’re gonna take me on, you can’t have any\nPokémon besides one Pikachu, OK?[VAR 0114(0169)]
So you really think your Pikachu is the strongest\nthere is?\c\nLet’s put that to the test![VAR 0114(0169)]
Let’s do this!
Let’s not
Yeah, I get why you’d back out. It’s only natural to\nbe scared of a Pikachu with a Light Ball![VAR 0114(0169)]
It’s go time, partner! Let’s show ’em what the\nstrongest Pikachu in the world can do![VAR 0114(0169)]
[~ 14]
Whoa! I can’t believe your Pikachu beat my\nLight Ball–boosted partner!\c\nCan you tell how shocked I am?[VAR 0114(0169)]
You’re both super strong, for sure. I’m so\nimpressed, I’ll even give you this Light Ball![VAR 0114(0169)]
Don’t worry—I have heaps of these things at\nhome![VAR 0114(0169)]
And hey, Pikachu—don’t you worry, either! We’ll\njust train more and get even stronger, OK?[VAR 0114(0169)]
If we get to Lv. 100 with our Light Ball, we’ll be\nthe best in the world for real![VAR 0114(0169)]
Pikaaa!

Alola![VAR 0114(016A)]
I’m with CHARGE—the Committee to Highlight\nAlolan Raichu and Generate Excitement!\c\nOur goal is to increase the popularity—and the\npopulation—of Alolan Raichu.[VAR 0114(016A)]
...Well, I say “our” goal, but I’m the only member\nof the committee for now.[VAR 0114(016A)]
In any case, are you familiar with regional forms?\c\nMaybe? Maybe not? Either way, here’s the scoop.[VAR 0114(016A)]
You know how some Pokémon’s looks can be\ninfluenced by the region they live in, right?[VAR 0114(016A)]
Well, in Alola, even the Pikachu we all know and\nlove evolve into a different form of Raichu![VAR 0114(016A)]
Rather than me explaining the differences, why\nnot try comparing the two yourself?[VAR 0114(016A)]
And I know just how you should do it!\c\nLet’s have a Pokémon battle between your Raichu\nand my Alolan Raichu![VAR 0114(016A)]
Once you’re ready to test your Raichu against my\nAlolan Raichu, just come and let me know.[VAR 0114(016A)]
[~ 10]
If you have a Raichu, I’d love to battle it with my\nAlolan Raichu. Make sure you only have a Raichu\r\nin your party—I’ll do the same.[VAR 0114(016A)]
Well, if it isn’t an Alolan Raichu! What a treat! But\nfor our battle, you need just a Raichu.[VAR 0114(016A)]
Ah, you brought a Raichu! Well then, care to\nbattle my Alolan Raichu?[VAR 0114(016A)]
Absolutely!
Not now
Aw, I hope you reconsider! It’s really important for\nmy—I mean, for CHARGE’s mission![VAR 0114(016A)]
Both Raichu have their charms, but the Alolan\nform has a different type—that means different\r\nstrengths and weaknesses. Stay on your toes![VAR 0114(016A)]
[~ 18]
What a spectacular victory! But don’t go\nassuming we’re done here yet.\c\nThe Committee to Highlight Alolan Raichu and\nGenerate Excitement has one last thing to offer...[VAR 0114(016A)]
Let’s trade: your Raichu for my Alolan Raichu!\nWhat do you say?[VAR 0114(016A)]
Let’s trade
No thanks
That’s too bad. Well, CHARGE will always be here\nwaiting if you change your mind![VAR 0114(016A)]
Trading Raichu is how we’ll spread the joy of the\nAlolan regional form![VAR 0114(016A)]
I completely understand! Pokémon trades can be\nso agonizing, can’t they?[VAR 0114(016A)]
You know, the Alolan form is lovely, of course, but\njust plain Raichu are pretty adorable, too![VAR 0114(016A)]
Rararaaai!
Well then, I’m off on another journey!\c\nI’ll travel over to Alola, befriend a bunch of Alolan\nRaichu, and spread their cuteness all around the\r\nworld... That’s what CHARGE is all about![VAR 0114(016A)]

People tend to make subconscious judgments\nbased on appearance, even if they don’t mean to.[VAR 0114(016B)]
Are you able to see others for who they truly are\nbeneath the surface? If so, please battle me.\c\nMy Pokémon are so incredibly powerful, I just\ndon’t know what to do with them![VAR 0114(016B)]
Please come speak to me once you’re prepared\nfor our Pokémon battle.[VAR 0114(016B)]
[~ 4]
Will you battle me even though I’ve warned you\nabout my Pokémon’s overwhelming power?[VAR 0114(016B)]
I’ll battle you
No, thank you
Yes, a wise decision.\c\nIf you lack faith in your ability to read opponents,\nit’s best to avoid futile battles.[VAR 0114(016B)]
So you’re confident that you can see my incredibly\npowerful Pokémon for what they truly are, hm?\r\nWell then, I’m quite excited for this battle![VAR 0114(016B)]
[~ 10]
Despite how they may look, all of my Pokémon are\nfierce fighters, seasoned by battle and brimming\r\nwith strength.[VAR 0114(016B)]
Some opponents take one look at their oh-so-\nadorable faces and drop their guard, only to be\r\nswiftly crushed by our might![VAR 0114(016B)]
That kind of thing doesn’t happen with Trainers\nwho are serious about battling.\c\nAfter all, they can pick up on a Pokémon’s true\nstrength pretty quickly when they see it in action.[VAR 0114(016B)]
We’re told not to make assumptions based on\nappearances, but we do it anyway because the\r\nfact is...you can’t know what’s under the surface.\c\nWhich is why my Pokémon and I will continue\nto take advantage of anyone foolish enough to\r\nunderestimate us![VAR 0114(016B)]

But...was it really a Shiny Mareep? Or were my\neyes playing tricks on me?[VAR 0114(016C)]
At this rate, I won’t be able to sleep tonight—no\nmatter how many Mareep I count![VAR 0114(016C)]
Please, you need to help me!\c\nIf you see a Shiny Mareep in Wild Zone 1, please\nlet me know![VAR 0114(016C)]

Please reach out if you end up finding that Shiny\nMareep in Wild Zone 1![VAR 0114(016C)]

There’s a Shiny Mareep!
Better let the requester know!
I came here in two shakes of a Mareep’s tail! So,\nwhere is it? Where’s the Shiny Mareep?[VAR 0114(016C)]

Thank you so, so much![VAR 0114(016C)]
I’m glad my eyes weren’t playing tricks on me.\nThat’s definitely a Mareep of a different color![VAR 0114(016C)]

Someone’s all wrapped up in Pokémon webbing.\c\nHit it with a high-powered Pokémon move to\nbreak it open and save whoever’s inside!

You’ve gotta use a stronger move than that!\c\nTo check a move’s power, just open the menu,\npick a Pokémon, and choose “Change moves.”[VAR 0114(0004)]

Thanks for your help getting me out of that sticky\nsituation! You really saved me![VAR 0114(016D)]

That was the work of these Spinarak here.[VAR 0114(016D)]
Well, truth is, the three of them are my partners—\nI call ’em the Spinarak Sibbies![VAR 0114(016D)]
When they get angry, they always wrap me up\nand leave me high and dry like that...[VAR 0114(016D)]

OK, OK! You’ve made your point! I’ll be more\ncareful, I promise![VAR 0114(016D)]
But you know what’d be a better use for all that\nsilk? Nets and ropes to sell for some quick cash![VAR 0114(016D)]

Police officers in Lumiose have Pokémon help out\nwith investigations, you know.[VAR 0114(016E)]
Me, I’ve been wanting to partner up with a\nPokémon called Shuppet.[VAR 0114(016E)]
I’ve heard it likes the negative emotions that\npeople feel—jealousy, vindictiveness, and so on.[VAR 0114(016E)]
So I was thinking with Shuppet’s help, I could\nzero in on people with strong negative feelings...[VAR 0114(016E)]
That’d make it easier to track down criminals. We\ncould even prevent crimes before they happen![VAR 0114(016E)]
Here’s where I need your assistance.\c\nIf you have a Shuppet, would you be willing to\ngive it to me?[VAR 0114(016E)]

Do you have a Shuppet you’d be willing to part\nwith?[VAR 0114(016E)]
Yeah, I have one
Sorry, not right now
Wonderful! Which Shuppet can I have?[VAR 0114(016E)]
Having a Shuppet would be a huge help... Yep,\nthat sure would make my life easier...[VAR 0114(016E)]
Nice to meet you, Shuppet![VAR 0114(016E)]
The peace of Lumiose depends on you! Let’s see\nwhat you can do![VAR 0114(016E)]
Whoa... You’re a big one, aren’t you? You’ll have\nno problem keeping the peace here in Lumiose![VAR 0114(016E)]
That being said, I don’t expect you to start reeling\nin criminals right off the bat, of course.[VAR 0114(016E)]
Shooop!
What’s this? Has it picked up on some negative\nfeelings already? Let’s follow it![VAR 0114(016E)]
[~ 19]
Wh-what’s going on? This...this is where I live![VAR 0114(016E)]
Shooo!
Oh! Are you already done for the day, dear?
No, no, I’m still on the job... You haven’t seen\nanything suspicious around here, have you?[VAR 0114(016E)]
I can’t say I have...\c\nWell, I guess you’re still busy with work... Good\nluck with the investigation.
Shup!
Shuppet? Why are you reacting to her?[VAR 0114(016E)]
Oh, what a nosy little Shuppet.\c\nIt must be reacting to these ugly feelings I’ve\nbeen keeping inside... I didn’t want you to know...
What do you mean... C-could it be?![VAR 0114(016E)]
It seems I’ve been too absorbed in my work...\c\nMy wife’s been so supportive, but she’s felt some\nresentment at me for being absent all the time.\c\nThose suppressed feelings almost turned into a\nfull-blown grudge...[VAR 0114(016E)]
And that’s what led Shuppet right here.[VAR 0114(016E)]
Shuuup.
We’ve been living together for so long... I just\nassumed we knew what the other was thinking.[VAR 0114(016E)]
But I was so preoccupied with my job that I didn’t\neven notice she was unhappy...\c\nOne fine husband I am.[VAR 0114(016E)]
I think I’m going to need your help a lot more\ngoing forward, Shuppet.[VAR 0114(016E)]
I’ll try my best to be a better partner so my wife\ndoesn’t feel the need to suppress her emotions.\r\nSo let me know if I ever need to try harder, OK?[VAR 0114(016E)]
[~ 36]
I don’t like how my mind goes to dark places\nsometimes...
Shuuu.
I’ll do my best to make sure my wife doesn’t have\nany reason to harbor dark feelings toward me...\r\nThough maybe Shuppet would prefer it if she did?[VAR 0114(016E)]

Can we have a special class about Mega\nEvolution? Pleeease?[VAR 0114(016F)]
Sure! Gather round, children
I’ll come back another time...
We can wait! We can totally wait![VAR 0114(016F)]
Yesss! We’ll take turns asking you questions, OK?\nI’ll go first![VAR 0114(016F)]
You know those little spheres you need to Mega\nEvolve your Pokémon? What’re they called?[VAR 0114(016F)]
Mega Pebbles
Mega Stones
Mega Boulders
I think I heard them being called something else...[VAR 0114(016F)]
Ohhh! They’re stones for Mega Evolving, so that\nmeans they’re called Mega Stones! Makes sense![VAR 0114(016F)]
Boulders? Aren’t boulders usually bigger, though?[VAR 0114(016F)]
I’ve got a question! Mega Stones are named after\nthe Pokémon they match with, right?[VAR 0114(019B)]
What kind of Mega Stone does Canari use to\nMega Evolve her Eelektross?[VAR 0114(019B)]
Eelektrossite
Eelektrite
Eelektross’s-ite
Yeah, that sounds right! Do all the Mega Stones\nhave that “-ite” at the end? It’s so funny![VAR 0114(019B)]
The correct answer is Eelektrossite...\c\nIt’s true that some Mega Stones don’t use the\nPokémon’s full name, but this one does.[VAR 0114(019B)]
That...that can’t be right.[VAR 0114(019B)]
My turn now![VAR 0114(019A)]
When Pokémon Mega Evolve, their moves get\nstronger. But what do you call those moves?[VAR 0114(019A)]
Max Moves
Surplus Moves
Plus Moves
I think you’ve got it mixed up with Dynamaxing.[VAR 0114(019A)]
Hmm... Are you taking this seriously?[VAR 0114(019A)]
Oh, I get it! Those moves do seem like a real plus![VAR 0114(019A)]
I heard that some Pokémon change types when\nthey Mega Evolve! Can you name one?[VAR 0114(0199)]
Mega Lucario
Mega Ampharos
Mega Manectric
Um... Mega Lucario keeps its Fighting and Steel\ntypes.[VAR 0114(0199)]
That’s right! Mega Ampharos gains the Dragon\ntype![VAR 0114(0199)]
Um... Mega Manectric stays an Electric type.[VAR 0114(0199)]
You’re all a bunch of nerds. I’m gonna ask\nsomething fun![VAR 0114(019C)]
Lots of Pokémon can Mega Evolve, right? Which\nMega Evolution do you think is the strongest?[VAR 0114(019C)]
Mega Emboar
Mega Meganium
Mega Feraligatr
Yeah, I guess there’s no right answer! Each one\nhas its own strengths and weaknesses.[VAR 0114(019C)]
Everyone’s had their turn to ask questions, right?\nThen we’re done with class![VAR 0114(016F)]
You know so much about Mega Evolution! You’re\ndefinitely a Mega Teacher![VAR 0114(016F)]
I’m not sure about all of the answers you gave us,\nthough...[VAR 0114(016F)]
Did you give us bogus answers so we’d have to do\nour own research? That’s rough...[VAR 0114(016F)]
After that class, I wanna learn even more about\nMega Evolution![VAR 0114(019A)]
Me too![VAR 0114(019C)]
Have you heard the rumor that’s been going\naround?\c\nEveryone’s saying that the strongest Mega\nEvolution user is gonna save Lumiose![VAR 0114(016F)]
[~ 63]
Mega Evolution’s really amazing![VAR 0114(0199)]
All this has made me want to find out more about\nMega Evolution.[VAR 0114(019A)]
That was WAY more interesting than anything\nwe’ve done at school![VAR 0114(019B)]
Thanks for teaching us![VAR 0114(019C)]

We’re about to start filming! Please stay out of\nthe way.[VAR 0114(0170)]
Hm? Oh, I see you have a Mega Ring... You must\nbe a formidable Trainer.[VAR 0114(0170)]
I’ll have you know I’m a rather well-known movie\ndirector...among those who know me.[VAR 0114(0170)]
I wanted to capture some footage of the wild\nPokémon here in Lumiose, up close and personal\r\nwith my Rotom Phone.[VAR 0114(0170)]
And for my first shoot, I decided to focus on a\nvicious Pokémon that uses its sharp fangs to tear\r\nits prey to shreds...Carvanha![VAR 0114(0170)]
But if I’m being honest, filming a wild Pokémon\nup close and personal is, well...[VAR 0114(0170)]
dangerous and scary![VAR 0114(0170)]
So I was hoping to find some charitable Trainers\nwho could help by letting me film their Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0170)]
Seeing as you’re a Trainer, perhaps you have a\nCarvanha? If so, could I capture some footage?[VAR 0114(0170)]
[~ 10]
If you’re willing to help with the filming, please\ncome to me with a Carvanha on your team![VAR 0114(0170)]
Are we not shooting yet?[VAR 0114(0195)]
I’m so nervous...[VAR 0114(0196)]
[~ 14]
Oh, I see you’ve brought a Carvanha. Does that\nmean you’re going to help me out?[VAR 0114(0170)]
Sure, I’d like to help!
Let me think about it
Please! I’ll pay you![VAR 0114(0170)]
All right, we’ve got everything we need... It’s time\nto begin the shoot![VAR 0114(0170)]
Now then, let’s film the next scene... Lights!\nCamera! Action![VAR 0114(0170)]
Watch out! It’s a Carvanha![VAR 0114(0195)]
Heeelp![VAR 0114(0196)]
Rrr... Urrr...
CUUUT![VAR 0114(0170)]
What’s wrong, Carvanha? You need to attack\nthem! Like, ferociously![VAR 0114(0170)]
Blup blup...
Uh, Director? I was looking up facts about\nCarvanha between takes...[VAR 0114(0195)]
Apparently it gets very timid when it’s all by itself.[VAR 0114(0195)]
What?! How am I supposed to get the footage I’m\nlooking for, then?[VAR 0114(0170)]
But now that I think about it... A Carvanha that’s\nscared of humans, hmm?[VAR 0114(0170)]
That’s not bad—not bad at all![VAR 0114(0170)]
It’s not what I had in mind, but we might still get\nsome really good footage from all this![VAR 0114(0170)]
[~ 33]
A Carvanha scared of humans... Such a unique\nscene! It’s going to make for some fine footage.[VAR 0114(0170)]
I’m glad filming’s underway, anyway.[VAR 0114(0195)]
Carvanha are cuter than I thought.[VAR 0114(0196)]

Oh, hello there! You’re the Trainer who helped us\nwith filming last time, right? Well, we’re shooting\r\na scene for a different movie now.[VAR 0114(0170)]
This time, we’re making a horror film![VAR 0114(0170)]
In particular, I want to get some footage of the\nfearsome ghost of the forest, Trevenant![VAR 0114(0170)]
But we’ve hit a snag... Wild Pokémon are\nterrifying! Especially Ghost types![VAR 0114(0170)]
I think you can help us there, however.[VAR 0114(0170)]
I hear Trevenant are rather hard to find in the wild.[VAR 0114(0170)]
Though there are rumors that they can sometimes\nbe spotted in Wild Zone 13. Or was it 15?[VAR 0114(0170)]
Or I suppose you could just evolve a Phantump.\nThat works too.[VAR 0114(0170)]
Really, all I need is for you to bring me a Trevenant\nat night. How you get it is up to you![VAR 0114(0170)]
[~ 10]
If you want to help with filming, then bring me a\nTrevenant at night![VAR 0114(0170)]
Ah, I see you have a Trevenant! I really appreciate\nyour willingness to help with the shoot. Come\r\nback at night so we can get started![VAR 0114(0170)]
Filming’s put on hold again, huh?[VAR 0114(0195)]
Filming horror stuff makes me nervous...[VAR 0114(0196)]
[~ 15]
Here you are! And you brought that Trevenant,\nright? Are you willing to help out with our shoot?[VAR 0114(0170)]
We’d love to!
Not right now
But I need the real deal! Only real Pokémon can\ngive me the intensity that I want![VAR 0114(0170)]
Oh, I knew I could count on you! Let’s start\nfilming then, shall we?[VAR 0114(0170)]
Is everyone ready? Then... Lights! Camera! Action![VAR 0114(0170)]
You sure this place isn’t haunted...?[VAR 0114(0196)]
Oh, c’mon! It’s fine![VAR 0114(0195)]
Hold on... Did you hear that?[VAR 0114(0196)]
What?[VAR 0114(0195)]
Veve!
Eeek!!![VAR 0114(0196)]
Wait, hold up. It’s not scary at all.[VAR 0114(0196)]
CUUUT![VAR 0114(0170)]
What kind of “ghost of the forest” is that? It’s way\ntoo friendly![VAR 0114(0170)]
You know, I’ve heard that Trevenant is really kind\nto all the creatures that live in the forest with it.[VAR 0114(0195)]
Maybe it thinks we’re forest creatures too?[VAR 0114(0196)]
What?! It’s a Ghost type, and yet it shows such\ncompassion...[VAR 0114(0170)]
Yet that is also a true side of this Pokémon!\nWorthy of being preserved on film![VAR 0114(0170)]
It’s the footage that matters, you see. Footage that\nleaves its mark on the viewer, even without any\r\ncohesive narrative! The script can be changed![VAR 0114(0170)]
[~ 36]
I alone shall gaze into the abyss that is Trevenant\nand learn its secrets![VAR 0114(0170)]
The script’s the blueprint for our movie... I wonder\nif we really can just change it around like this.[VAR 0114(0195)]
You know, I didn’t notice this before, but\nTrevenant has a very gentle gaze...[VAR 0114(0196)]

We meet again, my young friend! Today we’re\nfilming a kaiju movie![VAR 0114(0170)]
The story is this: An ancient Pokémon is brought\nback to life and goes on a rampage![VAR 0114(0170)]
In order to get the right feel, I need footage of the\nking of the ancient world—Tyrantrum![VAR 0114(0170)]
But I’m told the only way to accomplish this is by\npaying a small fortune for a fossil, then reviving it.[VAR 0114(0170)]
So that’s why I’ve been waiting for you![VAR 0114(0170)]
If you ever manage to revive a Tyrunt from a fossil\nand evolve it into a Tyrantrum, please help us\r\ncapture some footage of it![VAR 0114(0170)]
If you agree to help us, I’ll even let you be in the\nfilm! As an extra, of course, but still![VAR 0114(0170)]
[~ 8]
If you’re willing to help us out with the shoot,\nplease bring us a Tyrantrum.[VAR 0114(0170)]
No way are we gonna get this scene. We don’t\nhave the budget.[VAR 0114(0195)]
I’ve never seen an ancient Pokémon before...[VAR 0114(0196)]
[~ 12]
You really have a Tyrantrum with you?! Then can I\nassume you’re willing to help with the shoot?[VAR 0114(0170)]
Of course!
Not interested
Blast... I guess the only way to get the footage is\nfor me to dress up as a Tyrantrum![VAR 0114(0170)]
I knew I could count on you! And don’t forget to\ngive it your all as an extra.[VAR 0114(0170)]
All right, everyone, let’s do this! Lights... Camera...\nACTION![VAR 0114(0170)]
Wh-what is that?! Just there! Look![VAR 0114(0196)]
GRAOOOWWWR!!!
What in the world is that?!
It’s...it’s a monster!
It’s headed this way![VAR 0114(0195)]
Prrrm! Prrrrrrmmm!
CUUUT!!![VAR 0114(0170)]
Come on, now’s not the time to try and get\ncuddles from your Trainer! What’re you trying to\r\ndo, charm the audience?[VAR 0114(0170)]
Uh, Director? In spite of its fierce looks, I think\nTyrantrum actually can learn the move Charm.[VAR 0114(0195)]
I guess even that vicious temperament doesn’t\nstop it from being a cuddle bug with its Trainer![VAR 0114(0195)]
What?! Then that means it can’t be in the same\nscene as its Trainer![VAR 0114(0170)]
But wait, hold on a moment... An ancient\nPokémon forming a bond with a human...[VAR 0114(0170)]
Yes! Yes, I think that could work![VAR 0114(0170)]
Are you sure, Director? I don’t think we’ve had a\nsingle shoot where we stuck to the script...[VAR 0114(0196)]
Heh... Worry not![VAR 0114(0170)]
The theme of our films is no longer “The Terrifying\nReality of Wild Pokémon”![VAR 0114(0170)]
It is now “Coexisting with Wild Pokémon”![VAR 0114(0170)]
All our footage showing the heartwarming sides\nof Pokémon fits perfectly with this new theme![VAR 0114(0170)]
And I daresay it’s a better fit for Lumiose than\nfocusing on the terror.[VAR 0114(0170)]
Yes, this is going to be a huge hit... I can feel it![VAR 0114(0170)]
And we were able to make this pivot only due to\nyour help, my young friend! You have my thanks![VAR 0114(0170)]
[~ 40]
A movie series depicting coexistence with\nPokémon... It will be a hit! I’m sure of it![VAR 0114(0170)]
I’ve been playing along since he signs my\npaychecks, but I don’t think I’ll make it to stardom\r\nworking with this director...[VAR 0114(0195)]
Tyrantrum is so cute! Actually, all Pokémon are\nreally adorable, in my opinion.[VAR 0114(0196)]

Hey there. I’m a color contacts designer! Maybe\nyou’ve even used some of my designs?[VAR 0114(0173)]
The thing is, I’ve been stuck in a bit of a creative\nrut recently. I guess you’d call it a slump?[VAR 0114(0173)]
I need something to get my creativity flowing!\c\nI need inspiration through change...and I think I\nknow exactly what I need to see.[VAR 0114(0173)]
MEGA EVOLUTION![VAR 0114(0173)]
Mega Evolution is the definition of change! I need\nto see the power it brings to Pokémon![VAR 0114(0173)]
In particular, I want to see Mega Camerupt. I bet\nits powerful eruptions will blast me with ideas![VAR 0114(0173)]
And so I have to ask you... Do you think you could\nshow me Mega Camerupt in a battle?[VAR 0114(0173)]
[~ 8]
I want you to battle me and show me Mega\nCamerupt!\c\nYou’ll need to have a Camerupt holding its Mega\nStone on your team for that.[VAR 0114(0173)]

Please! I need inspiration to make fresh, new\ncolor contacts for everyone![VAR 0114(0173)]
Your Mega Camerupt is sure to bring me the fire I\nneed to create new color contacts![VAR 0114(0173)]
[~ 17]
There’s no point in us battling if you don’t show\nme a Mega Camerupt! We need to try again![VAR 0114(0173)]

Oooh! Camerupt looked like it was ready to\nexplode! I’m lovestruck![VAR 0114(0173)]
And that’s got my creative spirit all fired up! I’m\npractically bursting with ideas![VAR 0114(0173)]
I’m ready to deliver a whole new experience to\neach and every color contacts fanatic in Lumiose![VAR 0114(0173)]
You received color contacts in new designs:\n“fired up” and “lovestruck”!
My color contacts are evolving... I guess that’s\nwhat you’d call Mega EYE-volution![VAR 0114(0173)]
I bet if I saw more Mega Evolutions, I’d get even\nmore ideas!\c\nAnd you can change your own color contacts\nfrom the main menu whenever you want!\c\nJust press [VAR BD0A(0005)]Minus for “Outfit & Looks,” then press [VAR BD0A(0002)]ZR\nfor all the ways you can alter your looks![VAR 0114(0173)]

Hey there. I’m a color contacts designer! Maybe\nyou’ve even used some of my designs?[VAR 0114(0173)]
I could use a little more mega inspiration, like\nwhen you showed me Mega Camerupt.[VAR 0114(0173)]
Now, what are color contacts for? Your eyes! So\nI’m really interested in seeing a Pokémon with\r\ngreat big eyes...[VAR 0114(0173)]
SABLEYE![VAR 0114(0173)]
In particular, I want to see its eyes. I bet their\nglimmer will bring me sparkling inspiration.[VAR 0114(0173)]
And so I have to ask you... Do you think you could\nshow me Mega Sableye in a battle?[VAR 0114(0173)]
If you need to get your hands on Sableye’s Mega\nStone, you should head over to Quasartico.[VAR 0114(0173)]

There’s no point in us battling if you don’t show\nme a Mega Sableye! We need to try again![VAR 0114(0173)]
[~ 19]
Did you see Sableye’s starry eyes?![VAR 0114(0173)]
And the contrast of its body, like a black void...\nHow fitting for the Darkness Pokémon![VAR 0114(0173)]
I’m ready to deliver a whole new experience to\neach and every color contacts fanatic in Lumiose![VAR 0114(0173)]
You received color contacts in new designs:\n“starry eyes” and “black void”!
I don’t think I’m finished with Mega Eye-volution\njust yet...[VAR 0114(0173)]

One of my customers was telling me the other\nday that Medicham has perfected the art of yoga!\r\nIsn’t that amazing?[VAR 0114(0173)]
I guess for Medicham, it’s less Mega Evolution\nand more...[VAR 0114(0173)]
Yoga Evolution...?[VAR 0114(0173)]
I wanna see it! I gotta see a Mega Medicham![VAR 0114(0173)]
For our last battle, please show me the Mega\nEvolution of Medicham![VAR 0114(0173)]
I think you can get Medicham’s Mega Stone at\nthe Stone Emporium.[VAR 0114(0173)]

For our final battle, I want to see a Mega\nMedicham! You’ll need a Medicham with you.[VAR 0114(0173)]

Medicham was so incredible... It blew all the\ninspiration I had straight out of my head![VAR 0114(0173)]
The only things I can think of right now are...[VAR 0114(0173)]
Poké Balls for Pokémon![VAR 0114(0173)]
And the cyberspace Boxes where you store them![VAR 0114(0173)]
I’m ready to deliver a whole new experience to\neach and every color contacts fanatic in Lumiose![VAR 0114(0173)]
You received color contacts in new designs:\n“Poké Ball” and “cyber”!
Thank you so much for all your help!\c\nFrom now on, I’ll do my best to Mega Evolve my\nown Pokémon for inspiration.[VAR 0114(0173)]

Greetings. I have been expecting you.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Lady Jacinthe is waiting for you. Please come to\nthe Society of Battle Connoisseurs battling area.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Let me spell it out for you—go downstairs.\c\nAs you well know, nothing good can come from\nkeeping Lady Jacinthe waiting.[VAR 0114(0016)]

My dear [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0015)]
You have my sincerest thanks for requesting the\nInfinite Z-A Royale to be held as your reward for\r\nreaching Rank A.[VAR 0114(0015)]
In fact, it delighted me so much that I decided to\nhold a tournament of my own! It is called...[VAR 0114(0015)]
Le Super-Tournoi de Jacinthe O![VAR 0114(0015)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Care to guess what the [VAR FF00(0006)]O[VAR FF00(0000)] stands for,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0015)]
Out-of-this-world?
Oasis?
Only?
Ordinary?
Alors, incorrect! My tournaments are already out\nof this world, so adding that would be redundant.[VAR 0114(0015)]
Ah, a good guess! I am an oasis of beauty and\ncharm, but that is not the intended meaning.[VAR 0114(0015)]
Correct! Splendid![VAR 0114(0015)]
As if any one of my endeavors could be described\nas ordinary![VAR 0114(0015)]
This is a tournament between “only” you and me.\nThus, Le Super-Tournoi de Jacinthe O![VAR 0114(0015)]
No matter how many battles you win, your next\nopponent will always be me![VAR 0114(0015)]
Furthermore, you may face me as many times as\nyou like, whether or not you manage to win the\r\nentire tournament![VAR 0114(0015)]
So, do you understand now?[VAR 0114(0015)]
Of course
Not really
Oh, using an O in your reply! How clever of you,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0015)]
Honestly! As much as I know you love the sound\nof my voice, that is no way to keep me talking.[VAR 0114(0015)]
Now, let us begin. I am certain you will fully\nappreciate my brilliance once you experience it![VAR 0114(0015)]
Let the tournament begin!
Another time, maybe
A word of advice: it would be wise to battle Lady\nJacinthe as soon as you can.[VAR 0114(0016)]
[~ 30]
Alors, what a shame...\c\nBut I do hope you will try again another time.[VAR 0114(0015)]
[~ 32]
A most heartfelt congratulations on your victory.[VAR 0114(0015)]
Allow me to heal your Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0016)]

My favorite Pokémon is Flabébé![VAR 0114(0174)]
Right after being born, each Flabébé searches for\na flower it likes, then it cares for that flower for\r\nthe rest of its life![VAR 0114(0174)]
There are five colors of flower a Flabébé might\nchoose from: red, yellow, orange, blue, or white.[VAR 0114(0174)]
I’d really, really like to see each and every flower\ncolor that Flabébé can have![VAR 0114(0174)]
Seeing Flabébé holding all five flowers should\nhelp me come up with new hair colors, too.[VAR 0114(0174)]
Please, do you think you could show me five\nFlabébé—one with each flower color?[VAR 0114(0174)]
[~ 7]
People say Flabébé can be found near flower beds\nand on rooftops where no one usually visits.\c\nPlease, show me five Flabébé—one with each\nflower color![VAR 0114(0174)]
I have a Red Flower Flabébé
I have a Yellow Flower Flabébé

That’s a Red Flower Flabébé, all right. Thank you![VAR 0114(0174)]
Red brings passion to mind, doesn’t it? Perfect for\na new hair color, I’d say.[VAR 0114(0174)]
The red hair color is now available at hair salons.

That’s a Yellow Flower Flabébé, all right.\nThank you![VAR 0114(0174)]

Orange reminds me of autumn, you know... It’s\njust perfect for a new hair color.[VAR 0114(0174)]
The orange hair color is now available at hair\nsalons.

Oh, thank you for showing me all those Flabébé!\nThey made such a beautiful rainbow of hues![VAR 0114(0174)]

I evolved Flabébé of each flower color, so now I\nhave a full palette of Floette fabulosity![VAR 0114(0174)]
Flo-la-la.
And now I want to see all five of my Floette in\nbattle together.[VAR 0114(0174)]
I’m sure that would help me come up with even\nmore hair colors for you to try out![VAR 0114(0174)]
That’s where I could use your help.\c\nDo you think you could do me a huge favor and\nface all five of my Floette at once?[VAR 0114(0174)]
Just come and talk to me once you’re ready to\nface my whole team of Floette.[VAR 0114(0174)]

Are you ready to take on all five of my colorful\nFloette at once?[VAR 0114(0174)]
Bring it on!
I need to prep
Oh, I totally understand. You’ll need to be well\nprepared to battle all of them in one go![VAR 0114(0174)]
Go on then, Floette! Let’s have a vibrant battle![VAR 0114(0174)]
[~ 14]
Words can’t do it justice...[VAR 0114(0174)]
It’s as if the five flower colors blended together to\ncreate brand-new colors...\c\nI must make those colors a reality![VAR 0114(0174)]
Like maybe a set of pastel colors! I can make them\nby mixing different colors with white![VAR 0114(0174)]
Nine pastel hair colors are now available at hair\nsalons.
Now the people of Lumiose can enjoy all sorts of\nhair colors, thanks to you![VAR 0114(0174)]
And of course, if you ever feel like changing up\nyour own look, you can head to a hair salon too![VAR 0114(0174)]

Who dug this big hole right in the middle of our\ngarden?![VAR 0114(001D)]
Hey, I know you... You’re part of that Team MZ!\c\nListen, Mr. Corbeau really doesn’t like his garden\nbein’ messed up![VAR 0114(001D)]
So if you don’t wanna take the blame, you’d\nbetter go find out who did this![VAR 0114(001D)]

Hey, Team MZ grunt! You’d better have found the\none who made those holes...[VAR 0114(001D)]
It was this Pokémon
It was this Drilbur
A Pokémon, eh?\c\nWell, it’s still gotta answer for its crimes against\nour garden! I’m takin’ it to the office![VAR 0114(001D)]
And you’re comin’ too, Team MZ grunt![VAR 0114(001D)]

Doesn’t matter if you’re a Pokémon or a person.\nIf you cause trouble, you gotta make things right!\c\nSo go on, then! You better make this garden look\ngood as new![VAR 0114(001D)]
Ba-dril!
Hey, not bad! Looks even better than before.[VAR 0114(001D)]
Ba-dril!
You’ve got gusto, I’ll give you that. I’m gonna let\nyou join the Rust Syndicate as one of my\r\nunderlings! That should keep you outta trouble![VAR 0114(001D)]
But first, we need to teach you a Steel- or Poison-\ntype move. Wouldn’t do to have a Rust Syndicate\r\nmember without our trademark![VAR 0114(001D)]
Let’s go find you a TM with Poison Jab. This isn’t\na negotiation—you gotta learn that move, see?[VAR 0114(001D)]
Ba-dril!

Hey, I just found out that if Drilbur evolves, it\ngains the Steel type! It’s almost like it was fated\r\nto join the Rust Syndicate![VAR 0114(001D)]

There’s been quite a stir in the Pumpkaboo fan\ncommunity over the recent discovery...[VAR 0114(0175)]
“Recent discovery”?
What kind of stir?
Pumpkaboo used to be sorted based on their size:\nSmall Size, Average Size, Large Size, or Super Size.[VAR 0114(0175)]
However![VAR 0114(0175)]
It’s come to light that the differences between\nthem go beyond just size![VAR 0114(0175)]
So now they are called Small Variety, Medium\nVariety, Large Variety, and Jumbo Variety.[VAR 0114(0175)]
Don’t you think the new names sound more like\ndifferent breeds than anything else? I do![VAR 0114(0175)]
I want to see if they really are that different, so\nI’ve been collecting Pumpkaboo varieties.[VAR 0114(0175)]
But I haven’t had any luck finding the largest, the\nJumbo Variety.[VAR 0114(0175)]
They’re said to appear at night in Wild Zone 15.[VAR 0114(0175)]
Please, I need you to catch a Jumbo Variety\nPumpkaboo for me![VAR 0114(0175)]
It’ll be EVEN bigger than the Pumpkaboo I have\nhere, if you can believe that![VAR 0114(0175)]
Oh, there’s one more thing! Please don’t bring me\nan alpha Pokémon.\c\nIt’s hard to determine what variety it is when it’s\nalpha-sized.[VAR 0114(0175)]
[~ 15]
Did you bring me a Jumbo Variety Pumpkaboo?[VAR 0114(0175)]
You bet!
Not yet
Not even a Jumbo Variety could contain all my\nexcitement! Please, let me have it at once![VAR 0114(0175)]
Please help me in my search for a Pumpkaboo of\nthe Jumbo Variety.\c\nThey’re said to appear at night in Wild Zone 15.[VAR 0114(0175)]
[~ 21]
A Jumbo Variety alpha!\c\nNo thanks! I mean, it’s lovely, but there’s no\ntelling how many spirits a Pumpkaboo of this size\r\nwill end up carrying off to the afterlife.[VAR 0114(0175)]
Not even a Jumbo Variety could contain all my\ndisappointment! No more alpha Pokémon, please.[VAR 0114(0175)]
A Jumbo Variety Pumpkaboo![VAR 0114(0175)]
So this variety carries jumbo-sized spirits to the\nafterlife in its huge body? How mysterious![VAR 0114(0175)]
Even if they look similar, I can see how these\ndifferent varieties are indeed different forms![VAR 0114(0175)]
...Forgive me.\c\nTo be honest, I don’t really get it, but how could I\nNOT be convinced by the size of that Pokémon?![VAR 0114(0175)]
From now on, I’ll nurture my own spirit so it’s big\nenough to require a Jumbo Variety someday![VAR 0114(0175)]
From the bottom of my heart, thank you for\nbringing me a Jumbo Variety Pumpkaboo.[VAR 0114(0175)]
[~ 30]
Now that I have all four varieties of Pumpkaboo,\nspirits of any size can be carried to the afterlife.\r\nIf you ever need them, please let me know![VAR 0114(0175)]

Hey, you’re the one I talked to before, right?\nAbout the Hawlucha around these rooftops?[VAR 0114(0176)]
Yeah, I remember that
You’re the one who feeds it
I don’t know what you did, but I managed to find\nHawlucha again after that!\c\nIt was really lethargic, though.[VAR 0114(0176)]
And...ever since then, it’s been acting...strange.[VAR 0114(0176)]
It always has this faraway look on its face, as if\nit’s remembering something.[VAR 0114(0176)]
Luchaaah!
Oh my! What’s going on, Hawlucha?![VAR 0114(0176)]
It looks like it wants to battle...[VAR 0114(0176)]
Luchaaah!
Do you think maybe it wants to have a battle\nagainst you?[VAR 0114(0176)]
I guess it must want a rematch
This time in its right mind, huh?
Pardon? I-I don’t quite follow...[VAR 0114(0176)]
I’m not sure what’s going on, but if Hawlucha\nwants a battle, could you grant its wish?[VAR 0114(0176)]

Please, have a battle with Hawlucha![VAR 0114(0176)]

Are you ready to battle Hawlucha?
I’m ready!

Luchaaah!

Haw...
Thank you for the battle!
That was a fun rematch!
That was amazing! I had no idea Pokémon battles\ncould be so exciting...[VAR 0114(0176)]
It’s not about beating down an opponent... It’s\nabout facing each other without holding back.[VAR 0114(0176)]
Hey, Hawlucha...\c\nDo you think you could let me be your partner?[VAR 0114(0176)]
I’ll do more than just feed you... I promise I’ll\nlearn everything I can about being a Trainer.[VAR 0114(0176)]
I want to help you![VAR 0114(0176)]
Luchaaah!
Oh, thank you—I won’t let you down![VAR 0114(0176)]
Thank you so much for battling Hawlucha.[VAR 0114(0176)]
I thought it would be really hard for wild Pokémon\nto live in the city, but I guess Pokémon are more\r\npowerful than I ever imagined.[VAR 0114(0176)]

Hm. Well, in any case, do you think you could\nhelp me?[VAR 0114(0177)]
I let my darling Klefki hold all of my most\nimportant keys.[VAR 0114(0177)]
But it seems Klefki dropped one of them on our\nlast outing together...[VAR 0114(0177)]
Any idea where?
Where did you go?
Let me think... Oh yes, we went to a [VAR FF00(0006)]hair salon[VAR FF00(0000)]!\nBut it was my first time visiting that place, so I\r\ndon’t recall the exact location.[VAR 0114(0177)]
I was so pleased with my new look that I decided\nwe would have an elegant brunch at a [VAR FF00(0006)]café[VAR FF00(0000)] near\r\nthe hair salon.[VAR 0114(0177)]
Then another patron of the café challenged me to\na battle, so we went to the [VAR FF00(0006)]battle court [VAR FF00(0000)]out back.\r\nI won a magnificent victory, naturally.[VAR 0114(0177)]
If I could just remember which hair salon it was,\nI’m sure I could retrace my steps...[VAR 0114(0177)]
In any case—I entrust finding my key to you, my\ndearest detective’s assistant.[VAR 0114(0177)]

The day I lost my key, I went to a hair salon, then a\ncafé, and finally to a battle court behind the café.\c\nIf I may be so bold, might I suggest looking for a\nhair salon that has a café nearby?[VAR 0114(0177)]

You found a fancy key!
M[VAR 1100(00FF,0302)]r.iss Assistant! I just remembered I had my battle\nin this very battle court![VAR 0114(0177)]

Oh, my poor Klefki... It’s not your fault the key was\nlost. I’m the one who decided to battle here.[VAR 0114(0177)]
Ki ki?
But I do recall hearing that Klefki never let go of\nthe keys they like...[VAR 0114(0177)]
So, how about this: from now on, you’ll only have\nto hold the keys you like.[VAR 0114(0177)]
I’ll handle any other keys myself.[VAR 0114(0177)]
Ki ki! ♪
That means we’re going to be sharing some key\nresponsibilities, my darling Klefki![VAR 0114(0177)]
Thank you so much, M[VAR 1100(00FF,0302)]r.iss Assistant. Please, take\nthis as a sign of my gratitude.[VAR 0114(0177)]

I just don’t know what to do... My Meditite can’t\nseem to keep focused for very long at all.[VAR 0114(0179)]
I guess I’ve finally got no choice but to ask for\nhelp from the legendary yoga master![VAR 0114(0179)]
I heard from one of my yogi friends that the yoga\nmaster trains at “one circle among the five,” where\r\n“[VAR FF00(0006)]the clock points to 12:00[VAR FF00(0000)].”[VAR 0114(0179)]

Please! Could you help me find the legendary\nyoga master? Do it for Meditite![VAR 0114(0179)]

What brought you to me today, then?[VAR 0114(019D)]
Um, hello. I wanted to talk to you about my\nMeditite... It just can’t seem to stay focused![VAR 0114(0179)]
I’ve been making sure to give it plenty to eat, so it\ncan’t possibly be getting distracted by hunger![VAR 0114(0179)]
Well, there’s your problem.[VAR 0114(019D)]
Your Meditite should be eating just one Berry\neach day.[VAR 0114(019D)]
Eating more than necessary can put undue stress\non Meditite’s body, you know.[VAR 0114(019D)]
What...? But I just—[VAR 0114(0179)]
Don’t be alarmed. I’ll teach you all you need to\nknow, starting from the basics.[VAR 0114(019D)]
Really? Thank you so much! I can see why people\ncall you the legendary yoga master![VAR 0114(0179)]

And thanks to you for helping me find who I was\nlooking for![VAR 0114(0179)]
I don’t think I could get by on just one Berry each\nday, but I’ll make sure to take good care of myself\r\nso I can take good care of Meditite![VAR 0114(0179)]

Oh no... She looks upset.[VAR 0114(017A)]
I’m with the Fist of Justice, a group dedicated to\ngetting rid of wild zones so that Pokémon and\r\npeople can truly coexist in Lumiose.[VAR 0114(01A2)]
Letting your Whirlipede run amok like that... It’s\ngoing to make people think Pokémon are scary!\c\nAre you trying to make the Fist of Justice look bad\nor something?![VAR 0114(01A2)]
No, not at all![VAR 0114(017A)]
Whirlipede just suddenly started rolling and\nzoomed off![VAR 0114(017A)]
I didn’t mean to make anyone look bad! I swear![VAR 0114(017A)]
Whether you meant to or not, it makes trouble for\nus when Pokémon act dangerously out in public![VAR 0114(01A2)]

Teach me a lesson? Uh, OK, but I’d rather not do\nanything painful...or scary...[VAR 0114(017A)]
First off, you need to learn everything you can\nabout your Pokémon![VAR 0114(01A2)]
Whirlipede are surprisingly aggressive—they\ndon’t hesitate to smash into things at high speed.[VAR 0114(01A2)]
Pokémon will obey you as long as you have a high\nenough Royale Rank. But if that’s not the case...[VAR 0114(01A2)]
you should train with the Fist of Justice so that\nyou’re able to stop Whirlipede on your own!\c\nHave I made myself clear?![VAR 0114(01A2)]
Y-yes, understood![VAR 0114(017A)]
Wait, does this mean I’ll be training under Ivor?\nTHAT Ivor?[VAR 0114(017A)]

You sense something nearby...
Fwah...
Fwooo...
It looks like the wild Froslass wants to lead you\nsomewhere... Maybe you should follow it.
[~ 5]
Fwooo...
[~ 7]
Fwooo...
[~ 9]
Fwah...
Fwooo...
You found a Dawn Stone on the ground where\nFroslass had been!
You don’t sense Froslass anymore. It has\nvanished without a trace...

Just now...you beamed a message into my brain,\ndid you not?[VAR 0114(017C)]
Huh? No, that wasn’t me
What are you talking about?
There’s no need for pretense, my friend. You are\nclearly one of us.[VAR 0114(017C)]
We are all Trainers who live in the blessed\ncompany of Starmie.[VAR 0114(017C)]
Please...join our next gathering.\c\nWe shall invite the Starmie dwelling among the\nstars to descend and grace us with their presence.[VAR 0114(017C)]
For, as we know, Starmie are none other than the\nvery stars themselves.[VAR 0114(017C)]
Return here at night... And make sure you are\naccompanied by a Starmie of your own.[VAR 0114(017C)]
[~ 9]
Return here at night, accompanied by a Starmie\nof your own.[VAR 0114(017C)]
Staaar!
The stars must have guided you to us.
I can feel the energy of the universe...
Yes... I feel their call...
[~ 15]
I see you have a Starmie with you. Wonderful.[VAR 0114(017C)]
Let us begin.[VAR 0114(017C)]
It is time to call down the Starmie dwelling in the\nheavens.[VAR 0114(017C)]
We can achieve this only when our hearts are one\nwith those of our Starmie.[VAR 0114(017C)]
Staaar!!!
Please, join our invocation.[VAR 0114(017C)]
Staaar!
Staaar!
Staaar!
Staaar!
Staaar!
STAAAR!!!
Louder, everyone. Again![VAR 0114(017C)]
Staaar!
Staaar!
Staaar!
Staaar!
Staaar!
STAAAR!!!
We must all make our hearts as one! Do it for\nthose Starmie still dwelling among the stars![VAR 0114(017C)]
Staaar!
Staaar!
Staaar!
Staaar!
Staaar!
STAAAR!!!
Oh, look! Look! A shooting star![VAR 0114(0023)]
Seems like it fell toward Bleu Plaza.[VAR 0114(0020)]
Let us rejoice for what we have achieved this star-\nstrewn night!\c\nA new Starmie has decided to grace our planet![VAR 0114(017C)]
Thank you for joining us tonight. Please take this,\nalong with my gratitude.[VAR 0114(017C)]
We shall see you again in a year’s time.[VAR 0114(017C)]
[~ 47]
Staaar!
It looks like there’s something on the ground\nwhere the shooting star fell...

Do you know about Skarmory, the Armor Bird\nPokémon?[VAR 0114(017D)]
It sheds thin, sharp feathers that were once used\nto make swords. Today, they’re used for knives.[VAR 0114(017D)]
I’ve been wanting to get my hands on one of\nthose feathers so I can gift it to a top-class chef\r\nwho’s near and dear to my heart.[VAR 0114(017D)]
And a Z-A Royale Trainer such as yourself seems\nlike the perfect person to find one for me![VAR 0114(017D)]
Problem is, the Skarmory in Lumiose are found in\nWild Zone 17. And that zone is just bursting with\r\nferocious Pokémon.[VAR 0114(017D)]
That’s why I’m outsourcing the whole search to a\nTrainer of your talent... Thanks in advance![VAR 0114(017D)]
[~ 7]
Please find me a Skarmory feather! I suggest\nlooking in Wild Zone 17.[VAR 0114(017D)]
[~ 9]
Oh! It’s a Skarmory feather!
It’s a Skarmory talon... Too bad!
It’s a pile of cinders from a Lampent... Too bad!
It’s a sliver of metal from a Klefki’s key... Too bad!
It’s a tuft of Diggersby fur... Too bad!
It’s a chunk from a Chespin’s spike... Too bad!
It’s mane hair from a female Pyroar... Too bad!
It’s mane hair from a male Pyroar... Too bad!
It’s a shiny pebble... Too bad!
It’s a glittery bead... Too bad!
It’s a piece of sparkly sequin... Too bad!
I got the feeling you might’ve found a feather by\nnow, so I bolted past the Pyroar to get up here!\c\nThat’s the feather, right? Ooh, I can already tell\nit’ll make an incredible kitchen knife![VAR 0114(017D)]
SKARAAA!!!
Wh-why now?![VAR 0114(017D)]
Please! You need to scare off this Skarmory![VAR 0114(017D)]
SKARAAA!!!
[~ 26]
Phew... Why in the world would this Skarmory\nattack us like that?[VAR 0114(017D)]
SKARAAA!
Are you angry because...this feather is important\nto you? Well, it is to me too, you know![VAR 0114(017D)]
There’s a chef I want to give it to so he can make\nit into an amazing kitchen knife...[VAR 0114(017D)]
The food he cooks brings real joy to the good folks\nof Lumiose—and to the Pokémon too!\c\nHe’s a very special chef, so...please! Will you let\nme have this feather?[VAR 0114(017D)]
Skar!
You...you’re OK with me having it?![VAR 0114(017D)]
Skar!
Thank you so much for your help! I’ll tell the chef\nall about you and your kindness![VAR 0114(017D)]
Oh! And once he starts cooking meals with his\nnew knife, you’re very welcome to pay us a visit\r\nat Restaurant Le Wow![VAR 0114(017D)]
Skar!
I sure hope my feelings reached this Skarmory...\nDo you think it really understood me?[VAR 0114(017D)]
Yeah, it seems you got through to it
I bet it’ll show up at your restaurant
I suppose so! Now that I’ve made friends with a\nwild Pokémon, who knows what’ll happen next![VAR 0114(017D)]
[~ 42]
Thanks to you, I’ve gained something far more\nvaluable than a kitchen knife. I’m so grateful![VAR 0114(017D)]
Skar!

Why, hello. Would you be open to assisting a\nmaster perfumer in her quest?[VAR 0114(017E)]
I make my delightful fragrances using the scents\nproduced by Spritzee.[VAR 0114(017E)]
You see, the aroma of each Spritzee can differ in\ntantalizing ways, based on the diet they consume.[VAR 0114(017E)]
I’d like to see how a Berry-forward diet will affect\nthe aroma of my Spritzee here.[VAR 0114(017E)]
Ideally I’d like to try feeding Spritzee 20 Cheri\nBerries, 5 Tamato Berries, and 5 Occa Berries.[VAR 0114(017E)]
Zee?
But surely you see my conundrum.[VAR 0114(017E)]
I can’t spend too long wandering the city streets.\nThe competing odors that waft about would ruin\r\nmy nose, making me insensible to good smells![VAR 0114(017E)]
So I’d like to ask you to please get the Berries in\nmy stead![VAR 0114(017E)]
It would be wonderful if you collected Berries\naround town for me—you could even buy them!\r\nI’m not particularly fussy about how you do it![VAR 0114(017E)]
Just be sure to get me 20 Cheri Berries, 5 Tamato\nBerries, and 5 Occa Berries.[VAR 0114(017E)]
Zeeee?
[~ 13]
Get me 20 Cheri Berries, 5 Tamato Berries, and\n5 Occa Berries. Off you trot.[VAR 0114(017E)]
[~ 15]
Ah, wonderful. You’re here with my 20 Cheri\nBerries, 5 Tamato Berries, and 5 Occa Berries.[VAR 0114(017E)]
Having this many Berries will allow for a rich\ncomplexity in the aroma Spritzee produces.[VAR 0114(017E)]
And since all of these Berries have a spicy flavor,\nthis new perfume should have quite the kick.[VAR 0114(017E)]
SPRRRIIIIIIT!!!
What is it, Spritzee? Is something bothering you?\nI can’t imagine what.[VAR 0114(017E)]
Don’t tell me this is too many Berries for you?[VAR 0114(017E)]
Sprrriiit!
But don’t you want to explore all the wondrous\naromas your body can produce?[VAR 0114(017E)]
Spritzeeeeee!!!
I see! Yes, I understand you perfectly, my friend.\nWe just need to find a way for you to eat all these\r\nBerries without getting overwhelmed![VAR 0114(017E)]
You know, Lumiose used to have a famous Juice\nShoppe...[VAR 0114(017E)]
If I can find a former employee of that shop, they\nshould be able to whip these Cheri Berries into a\r\ntasty Red Juice for Spritzee![VAR 0114(017E)]
Zeee!
Thanks to you, I now know what I need to create a\nwhole flurry of new fragrances!\c\nSo take a little something from me in return—\nsome sprigs of Modest Mint and an Exp. Candy.[VAR 0114(017E)]
Zee zee!
[~ 31]
Thanks to you, I now know what I need to create a\nwhole flurry of new fragrances!\c\nPerhaps my former apprentice, Odette, will see\nthat my skill is still nothing to be sniffed at![VAR 0114(017E)]

Hey, who’s the customer here?!
[VAR BD06(0000)]Oh, hey, [VAR 0100(0000)]! Sorry to\nspring\r\nthis\r\non\r\nyou,\r\nbut\r\ngimme\r\na\r\nhand,\r\nwill ya?[VAR 0114(002C)]
This guy needed help carrying stuff, but when we\noffered our services, he made a crazy request!\c\nSo I told him it’s not possible, and now he’s all up\nin our faces demanding a battle![VAR 0114(002C)]
All I asked was for you to carry my precious\nAggron, but now you say that’s impossible?![VAR 0114(018E)]
Aggron weighs nearly 800 pounds! How do you\nexpect anyone to carry that?![VAR 0114(002C)]
I don’t wanna hear it! You’ve got nerve, making\nan offer and immediately going back on it.\c\nI’ll whip you into shape—both of you![VAR 0114(018E)]
I came to Lumiose to join the Z-A Royale!\c\nIf I can’t take out two upstarts like you, I’ve got no\nbusiness even being here![VAR 0114(018E)]
Doesn’t seem like anything will get through to\nhim. So come on, battle him with me![VAR 0114(002C)]
[~ 10]
You ready to battle him with me?[VAR 0114(002C)]
Let’s do this
Gimme a sec
How much longer are you gonna drag your feet?[VAR 0114(002C)]
Remember how we met? Funny how Pancham\ncarried your stuff to me, and now here we are.[VAR 0114(002C)]
Sorry for the trouble back then, and thanks for\nagreeing to help me out now![VAR 0114(002C)]
Aggron and my other Pokémon are going to send\nyou all flying![VAR 0114(018E)]
[~ 18]
I had no idea that Lumiose City’s Trainers were\nso formidable![VAR 0114(018E)]
OK, never mind about the Z-A Royale! Once we’ve\ndone some sightseeing, we’re heading home![VAR 0114(018E)]
“Carry my Aggron,” he says... Sheesh, if he’d just\nbeen reasonable, we’d have been happy to show\r\nhim around.[VAR 0114(002C)]
Panch!
[VAR BD06(0000)]Thanks, [VAR 0100(0000)]. You really\nhelped!\c\nI appreciate you lending us a hand, even after we\nkinda took your bag.[VAR 0114(002C)]
And I do kind of owe you. Seeing Pancham carry\nyour travel bag back then gave me an idea...[VAR 0114(002C)]
So I started a business showing tourists around\nLumiose while carrying their bags for ’em.[VAR 0114(002C)]
After all, Pokémon like Pancham can climb fences\nand get into places where people can’t.[VAR 0114(002C)]
Hey! You’re late—is everything OK?[VAR 0114(002D)]
Andre? Yeah, everything’s fine.[VAR 0114(002C)]
We ran into some trouble, but we took care of it.\nI’ll come meet you now![VAR 0114(002C)]
I hear you’re doing pretty well in the Z-A Royale.\c\nMakes me proud to think your first Pokémon\nbattle in Lumiose was against me.[VAR 0114(002C)]
OK, see you later. I hope we meet again![VAR 0114(002C)]

This is not good...[VAR 0114(0197)]
DEFINITELY not good...[VAR 0114(0198)]
Hey, you look like a formidable Trainer.[VAR 0114(0197)]
Think you could do us a little favor?[VAR 0114(0198)]
See, we’re really big Spewpa fans.[VAR 0114(0197)]
But our collection of Spewpa...accidentally got\nloose here in the museum.[VAR 0114(0198)]
Which is where you can lend a hand.[VAR 0114(0197)]
Please, find our missing Spewpa![VAR 0114(0198)]
There are [VAR FF00(0006)]12[VAR FF00(0000)] of them in all.[VAR 0114(0197)]
Please find them! Our shared love of Spewpa is\nwhat allowed the two of us to find one another![VAR 0114(0198)]
But you should know that Spewpa spew out black\npowder when they feel threatened.[VAR 0114(0197)]
So please don’t try to battle them—we’re in a\nmuseum, not a wild zone! They could ruin the art![VAR 0114(0198)]
If you just find them and approach them normally,\nthey’ll surely come back to us.[VAR 0114(0197)]
[~ 14]
Please find all 12 of our lost Spewpa here in the\nmuseum![VAR 0114(0197)]
If you can get close to our Spewpa without\nspooking them, they’ll surely come back to us.[VAR 0114(0198)]

You found a lost Spewpa sitting on the handrail,\nas if it’s trying to guide folks to the upper floor!
Spew.

You found a lost Spewpa looking quite comfy in\nthe cozy space between these sofas!

Thank you for finding all our Spewpa for us![VAR 0114(0197)]
They’re so precious to us... We’d better do one\nlast headcount before we go.[VAR 0114(0198)]
One...two...three...four...five...six...[VAR 0114(0197)]
Seven...eight...nine...ten...eleven...twelve...[VAR 0114(0198)]
Thir...teen?[VAR 0114(0197)]
What?! Where’d the thirteenth one come from?![VAR 0114(0197)]
I don’t know, but we can only take twelve of them\nbetween the two of us...[VAR 0114(0198)]
I suppose the best solution would be to have this\nkind Trainer take this new fellow off our hands?\c\nWe can’t leave it here alone—it might damage the\nart and end up in real trouble...[VAR 0114(0197)]
Oh! But your Boxes are all full, aren’t they?\c\nThen we’ll keep an eye on this Spewpa until you\nmake space for it. Come back soon, though![VAR 0114(0197)]
I wonder if our 12 Spewpa went wandering off to\nfind that 13th Spewpa or something...[VAR 0114(0198)]
We simply can’t thank you enough for helping us\nfind our precious Spewpa![VAR 0114(0197)]

My Numel![VAR 0114(0180)]
[~ 2]
My Numel’s been frozen into a solid block of ice![VAR 0114(0180)]
We were taking a walk in the wild zone...[VAR 0114(0180)]
when suddenly we got caught in the middle of\na bunch of wild Pokémon fighting each other!\r\nNumel got hit with, like, 10 Ice Beams![VAR 0114(0180)]
Numel’s a Fire type, but it’s not thawing out at all![VAR 0114(0180)]
Not even an Ice Heal did the trick. The only other\noption is to use a superhot Fire-type move![VAR 0114(0180)]
So please, you’ve got to help me!\c\nThaw Numel out by hitting it with a superhot Fire-\ntype move![VAR 0114(0180)]
[~ 9]
I think the ice will melt if you hit it with a really\npowerful Fire-type move, such as Flamethrower.\c\nI’m so worried about Numel... I know it’s a Fire\ntype itself, but it might catch a cold![VAR 0114(0180)]
[~ 11]
That move won’t work! Only a blisteringly hot Fire-\ntype move can melt that ice![VAR 0114(0180)]
That worked—all the ice is melted! Oh, thank you\nso much![VAR 0114(0180)]
Are you OK, Numel?![VAR 0114(0180)]
Wait... Were you snacking on Berries the whole\ntime you were frozen?![VAR 0114(0180)]
Mrph.
I guess that’s fitting... Numel is the Numb\nPokémon, after all.[VAR 0114(0180)]

We’re gonna go for Tyrantrum! It’s called the\nDespot Pokémon—you can’t beat that![VAR 0114(0182)]
That’s what you say, but I think Aurorus is plenty\nstrong too.[VAR 0114(0181)]
Hey, you’re a Trainer, right? Maybe you can help\nus. Which do you prefer: Tyrantrum or Aurorus?[VAR 0114(0181)]
Hey, leave strangers out of it! We already know\nwhat we’re getting—a Jaw Fossil![VAR 0114(0182)]
Besides, I’m the one who gets to decide which\nPokémon we’re adding to our team.\c\nI don’t care what my little sister says![VAR 0114(0182)]
You’re so mean![VAR 0114(0181)]
Please, could you show my brother how strong\nAurorus can be?[VAR 0114(0181)]
I bet he’ll change his mind if you defeat his\nPokémon with nothing but an Aurorus![VAR 0114(0181)]
I know how you can get one, too! Just get hold of\na Sail Fossil and restore it into an Amaura.\c\nAfter that, you can evolve Amaura into Aurorus by\nleveling it up![VAR 0114(0181)]
Come let me know when you’re ready to take on\nmy brother with nothing but an Aurorus.[VAR 0114(0181)]
[~ 11]
I know all about Aurorus! Get a Sail Fossil and\nrestore it into an Amaura, then you can evolve\r\nAmaura into Aurorus by leveling it up.\c\nPlease, beat my brother using just one Aurorus![VAR 0114(0181)]
You better only have one Aurorus on your team if\nwe’re gonna battle. That’s what my sister wants.[VAR 0114(0182)]
[~ 14]
Oh, you brought an Aurorus! Thank you so much!\nAre you ready to battle?[VAR 0114(0181)]
Let’s do this!
I need more time
Oh yes, of course... You need to be well prepared\nto show off Aurorus’s strength.[VAR 0114(0181)]
Please don’t go easy on him—you need to go all\nout if you want to prove Aurorus’s strength![VAR 0114(0181)]
I don’t care what kind of Trainer you are, or how\nstrong Aurorus is. My Pokémon is stronger![VAR 0114(0182)]
[~ 21]
That was amazing! I knew Aurorus was a powerful\nPokémon![VAR 0114(0181)]
See? I told you—we should get a Sail Fossil![VAR 0114(0181)]
That didn’t prove anything about Aurorus—it just\nshowed this Trainer is really strong, that’s all![VAR 0114(0182)]
M-maybe, but still...[VAR 0114(0181)]
So next time, Nage, you should battle me with an\nAurorus of your own.[VAR 0114(0182)]
How else are we really going to prove how strong\nAurorus is?[VAR 0114(0182)]
S-so does that mean...?[VAR 0114(0181)]
Yeah. It means I’ll get you that Sail Fossil. But\nmake sure you raise Amaura properly![VAR 0114(0182)]
Thank you so much for battling my brother![VAR 0114(0181)]
I promise I’ll raise the strongest Aurorus in the\nworld![VAR 0114(0181)]
[~ 32]
We’re gonna get along great, Amaura.[VAR 0114(0181)]
I’ll battle Nage when her Amaura evolves. It’ll be\nTyrantrum versus Aurorus—the showdown![VAR 0114(0182)]

If I told you there’s a Mawile out there that can’t\nbe caught, you wouldn’t believe me, would you?[VAR 0114(0183)]
But it’s true! I came across a Mawile that I’d\ndescribe as downright uncatchable.[VAR 0114(0183)]
I don’t even know how many Ultra Balls I wasted\ntrying.[VAR 0114(0183)]
Tell you what—if you manage to catch that\nMawile, I’ll give you the 20 Ultra Balls I have left![VAR 0114(0183)]
The uncatchable Mawile is up on the rooftop of a\nbuilding near the electrical substation. Good luck![VAR 0114(0183)]

But the Mawile came back! It’s almost as if it’s\ntaunting you.

I figured now was about when you’d give up on\ntrying to catch Mawile.[VAR 0114(0183)]
Mawa!
Wait, is this the one that I...?[VAR 0114(0183)]
It is! You managed to catch the uncatchable\nMawile?![VAR 0114(0183)]
I heard that Pokémon only let themselves be\ncaught by Trainers they deem to be worthy...\r\nDo you think that’s true?[VAR 0114(0183)]
Either way, Pokémon really are quite an enigma.[VAR 0114(0183)]

There are so many amazing options, you know?[VAR 0114(0184)]
I keep scouring the ads because they all look so\ngood. At this rate, I’ll never choose a place to live![VAR 0114(0184)]
Actually, maybe you could help. This is all I really\nneed...[VAR 0114(0184)]
First off, it’s Lumiose, so you gotta have a view of\nthe tower, right?\c\nSo obviously, my dream apartment’s gotta be\nright [VAR FF00(0006)]in front of Prism Tower[VAR FF00(0000)].[VAR 0114(0184)]
And what else is this city known for? That’s right,\nthe Saison Canal!\c\nI want to live somewhere [VAR FF00(0006)]along the canal[VAR FF00(0000)] so I can\ngaze out over its graceful flow on the daily.[VAR 0114(0184)]

And you never want to be too far from a [VAR FF00(0006)]café[VAR FF00(0000)] or\n[VAR FF00(0006)]Pokémon Center[VAR FF00(0000)], right? Those are vital.[VAR 0114(0184)]
Am I asking too much? I keep looking at great\nplaces, but none of them tick all my boxes.[VAR 0114(0184)]
So how about you find the perfect place for me?[VAR 0114(0184)]
Come on, bud. Find Heliolisk and me the perfect\npad. I know you can do it![VAR 0114(0184)]
[~ 13]
My perfect place has gotta be in front of Prism\nTower, along the canal, and have rooftop space\r\nwith tables and umbrellas!\c\nOh, and I want to be close to a Pokémon Center\nand a café too![VAR 0114(0184)]
[~ 15]
An apartment building right beside Prism Tower,\nalong the Saison Canal, and with a rooftop space\r\nthat has tables and umbrellas... It’s perfect!
My new bestest bud! You say you’ve found the\nperfect place for Heliolisk and me?[VAR 0114(0184)]
Now isn’t this something![VAR 0114(0184)]
It’s in front of Prism Tower![VAR 0114(0184)]
It’s right beside the Saison Canal![VAR 0114(0184)]
It’s got tables and umbrellas on a great rooftop![VAR 0114(0184)]
And it’s even close to a café and Pokémon Center![VAR 0114(0184)]
This is it! This has got to be it! I’m gonna go talk\nwith the leasing office at once![VAR 0114(0184)]
Good news, bud! They said they have a vacant\nunit, so I can move in right away![VAR 0114(0184)]
And look how happy Heliolisk seems! Can’t you\nimagine it living its best life up here?[VAR 0114(0184)]
Li li li!
Though...the rent is out of control. If I take this\nplace, I won’t be able to afford the cost of living![VAR 0114(0184)]
Li li liiiiii...
But I’ve decided![VAR 0114(0184)]
I love Heliolisk too much to compromise on any\naspect of our life together! It’s gotta be this place![VAR 0114(0184)]
So thanks for finding it! As for the rent money,\nwell...guess I’d better get good at the Z-A Royale![VAR 0114(0184)]
[~ 32]
Look how happy Heliolisk looks up here! I’d do\nanything to keep that smile on its face.[VAR 0114(0184)]
Li li lisk!

You gotta help me![VAR 0114(0185)]
My little sister wandered off after a Litwick![VAR 0114(0185)]
I’ve heard about Litwick... They’re the Pokémon\nthat suck out your life force![VAR 0114(0185)]
What if my sister has all her life force drained...?\nWhat if she never comes back...?[VAR 0114(0185)]
Please! You’ve gotta help me find my sister![VAR 0114(0185)]
Fwoop... Shoo...
That was a Litwick![VAR 0114(0185)]
Maybe if we follow it, we’ll be able to find my\nsister![VAR 0114(0185)]
[~ 9]
I bet if we follow that Litwick, we’ll find my sister![VAR 0114(0185)]
[~ 11]
Litwick went that way![VAR 0114(0185)]
It’s over there![VAR 0114(0185)]
It jumped down toward the river![VAR 0114(0185)]
[~ 15]
There doesn’t seem to be a single wild Pokémon\naround...
Maybe you should go further into the sewers and\nsee what you can find.
Is my sister really down here? I hope she’s OK...[VAR 0114(0185)]
Hurry! We don’t want to lose it![VAR 0114(0185)]
Did it go in there...?[VAR 0114(0185)]
[~ 21]
Who are you...?[VAR 0114(0022)]
Consei asked me to help
Where did the Litwick go?
Oh... So you came to find me?[VAR 0114(0022)]
My brother worries too much...[VAR 0114(0022)]
Hee hee... Well, we’re almost done here...[VAR 0114(0022)]
Hey! Are you OK?![VAR 0114(0185)]
Oh, thank goodness... I was worried you’d never\nwake up.[VAR 0114(0185)]
My sister says she came here to help this Litwick.[VAR 0114(0185)]
The poor little thing seemed really weak, so I was\nletting it absorb some of my life force.[VAR 0114(0022)]
I heard somewhere that’s what helps Litwick stay\nhappy and healthy...[VAR 0114(0022)]
Y-you should leave that kind of thing to someone\ngrown-up like me! I have way more life force![VAR 0114(0185)]
Yeah, I guess...[VAR 0114(0022)]
Thanks for coming to find me, anyway.[VAR 0114(0022)]
Bye-bye. I hope you feel better now, Litwick.[VAR 0114(0022)]

Hey now, that sludge is ours! Hands off![VAR 0114(0186)]
[~ 2]
I bet you’ve seen a lot of sludge piles around\ntown, right?[VAR 0114(0186)]
Just like that pile over there.[VAR 0114(0186)]
My gray brain-meat had an idea. I bet I could\nmake a fortune with a sludge-cleaning business![VAR 0114(0186)]
So I caught myself a Clauncher since it’s good at\nthe move Water Gun. We’re all set![VAR 0114(0186)]
Except we’re not!\c\nClauncher’s not interested in washing away the\nsludge at all![VAR 0114(0186)]
Shwaaa!
So I need you to do something for me![VAR 0114(0186)]
Show my Clauncher how cool your Pokémon\nlooks using Water Gun to wash away that sludge!\r\nMaybe then it’ll want to give it a try too.[VAR 0114(0186)]
[~ 11]
Show my Clauncher how cool your Pokémon\nlooks using Water Gun to wash away that sludge!\r\nMaybe then it’ll want to give it a try too.[VAR 0114(0186)]

[~ 14]
Beautiful! All nice and clean—not a trace of\nsludge![VAR 0114(0186)]
See how it’s done, Clauncher?\c\nJust blast sludge with Water Gun, and wash it\nall away![VAR 0114(0186)]
Shwaaa.
Not rocks! Sludge![VAR 0114(0186)]
Shwaaahhh!
Wha—? It busted a rock with Water Gun?![VAR 0114(0186)]
Hey, great job, Clauncher! You pack a punch![VAR 0114(0186)]
Shwaaa!
No wonder you weren’t interested in the sludge.[VAR 0114(0186)]
But we’re still gonna clean up all the sludge\naround town![VAR 0114(0186)]
Shwaaa?
And that’s not all we’ll do—we’re gonna take on\nthe world of Pokémon battling with your\r\noutstanding power![VAR 0114(0186)]
Who’s to say we can’t do everything we dream of!\nAnd we’ll do it together, partner![VAR 0114(0186)]
Thanks to you, I got to see Clauncher’s true\npotential. It’s really opened some doors for us![VAR 0114(0186)]

Not this Chespin again... It’s always blocking my\ntaxi![VAR 0114(0187)]
CHEEEH!!!
Why are you trying to fight my taxi? Go battle\nother Pokémon like everyone else does![VAR 0114(0187)]
You’re a Trainer, right? Do you think you could\nbattle this feisty Chespin?\c\nA Pokémon-versus-taxi battle seems like it would\nend badly for both sides...[VAR 0114(0187)]
[~ 5]
Think you could give this Chespin a proper\nPokémon battle as a Trainer?[VAR 0114(0187)]
[~ 7]
Will you battle Chespin?
I’ll do it!
No way
Cheeeh?!
SPIN SPIN!
[~ 13]
CHEEEAAAH!
It looks like Chespin isn’t admitting defeat!
[~ 16]
CHEAHHH!!!
It looks like Chespin still wants to battle some\nmore!
[~ 19]
Cheah!
It looks like Chespin still wants to battle EVEN\nmore...
Slow down, Chespin! You’re going too hard![VAR 0114(0187)]
Honestly, the way to get stronger is by working\nwith a Trainer, not fighting one. Right?[VAR 0114(0187)]
I’d say that’s right
I could make it stronger
See? Even this nice Trainer says so. Wouldn’t you\nrather go with h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]imer, Chespin?[VAR 0114(0187)]
Cheah!
Good for you! Now you can have this Trainer help\nyou get really strong![VAR 0114(0187)]
You obtained Chespin!
One last thing from me before you go...\c\nRemember this, Chespin: Taxis are for riding, not\nfor battling![VAR 0114(0187)]
Once there’s space, you can take Chespin here\nwith you. So organize those Boxes!
Great! Now you can take Chespin with you, huh?[VAR 0114(0187)]
Cheh!
Maybe Chespin kept trying to pick fights with my\ntaxi so it could eventually meet someone like you![VAR 0114(0187)]

This poor wild Fennekin doesn’t seem well at all...[VAR 0114(0188)]
Feh...
It won’t even sniff at any of the food I offer it.\c\nAnd when I took it to the Pokémon Center, they\nweren’t sure what might be wrong with it...[VAR 0114(0188)]
Ah! You know, I recall there was once an herbalist\nwho had set up shop around here in Lumiose...\c\nHe no longer runs that old store, but perhaps he’d\nhave something that could help![VAR 0114(0188)]
I’ll stay by this little one’s side for now. Please go\nsee if you can find the old herbalist, won’t you?[VAR 0114(0188)]
I believe he’s a regular at Café Classe.[VAR 0114(0188)]
[~ 7]
You should head to Café Classe. I believe the old\nherbalist’s a regular there.[VAR 0114(0188)]
[~ 9]
Yes, hello? What do you need?[VAR 0114(001E)]
Are you the herbalist?
There’s a sickly Pokémon...
Ah, I see... A Fennekin that’s feeling poorly, hm?[VAR 0114(001E)]
Fennekin are known to eat twigs for an energizing\nand soothing snack.[VAR 0114(001E)]
I imagine a Revitalizing Twig in particular could\nperk your Fennekin right up.[VAR 0114(001E)]
But the area where I used to gather them is now a\npart of Wild Zone 5...[VAR 0114(001E)]
You can tell a Revitalizing Twig by its sweet scent.\c\nThough it won’t be easy to find one while fending\noff attacks from wild Pokémon...[VAR 0114(001E)]
[~ 18]
You may still be able to find Revitalizing Twigs in\nthe Bleu District’s Wild Zone 5.\c\nYou’ll know them by their sweet smell.[VAR 0114(001E)]
[~ 20]
This twig seems shriveled... It doesn’t look like it\nwould revitalize anyone.
This twig has been gnawed on by something...\nNo one would be revitalized by this.
This twig is pretty broken and damaged... It\ndoesn’t seem like it would revitalize anyone.
This twig’s all dry and brittle... Probably not the\nsort of thing that would revitalize anyone.
This twig gives off a nice, sweet smell... You’ve\nfound the perfect Revitalizing Twig!
Time to head back to that sickly Fennekin!
[~ 27]
A Revitalizing Twig...?\c\nI had no idea such a thing existed! That herbalist\nis a true gem—and so are you for finding one![VAR 0114(0188)]
Let’s give it to Fennekin at once.[VAR 0114(0188)]
You fed the Revitalizing Twig to the wild Fennekin![VAR 0114(0188)]
Fen! Fen!
How delightful! It’s looking wonderfully energetic\nnow![VAR 0114(0188)]
Kiiin!
Why, it seems like this Fennekin has taken a shine\nto you! Why not let it tag along?[VAR 0114(0188)]
Fenniiik!
You obtained Fennekin!
Do take good care of that Fennekin, won’t you?[VAR 0114(0188)]
If you want to take Fennekin with you, make some\nspace in your Boxes!
[~ 39]
I’m sure Fennekin could tell how much work you\nput into helping it feel better, dear.[VAR 0114(0188)]

Feast your eyes on this! It’s our masterpiece!\nOur greatest, hardest-ever scaffolding course![VAR 0114(0189)]
And the current record holder for clearing this\ncourse the quickest is...[VAR 0114(0189)]
that wild Froakie over there![VAR 0114(0189)]
Froak!
Look at that smug face. It’s got “I’m faster than\nyou slouches” written all over it![VAR 0114(0189)]
We’ve gotta show that Froakie what humans are\ncapable of, kid! Help me bring it down a peg![VAR 0114(0189)]
If you can clear this course in [VAR FF00(0006)]30 seconds[VAR FF00(0000)] or less,\nthen that Froakie’ll have to admit you’re good![VAR 0114(0189)]

Ooh, now that’s a shame! You didn’t make it up\nbefore running out of time![VAR 0114(0189)]
YOU DID IT!!![VAR 0114(0189)]
You cleared the course in time![VAR 0114(0189)]
[~ 26]
You did it, kid! You showed that Froakie just how\ncapable humans are![VAR 0114(0189)]
Or did you?! We’re not done here yet, I’m afraid!\nThe gauntlet is still long before you![VAR 0114(0189)]
Froak froak!

Aw, please! Show Froakie that humans...or rather,\nthat YOU’RE a competitor to be reckoned with![VAR 0114(0189)]

Froooak.
You obtained Froakie!
And you also deserve a reward from me for that\nimpressive speed-running performance![VAR 0114(0189)]

GRUOOOHHH!!!

The Pangoro Duo! Not again![VAR 0114(0033)]
These two are always causing us trouble—it’s like\nthey go out of their way to avoid the wild zones![VAR 0114(0033)]
They’re real tough customers. Even Ivor-sensei\nhas a hard time driving them away unscathed.[VAR 0114(0033)]
But if Sensei isn’t here to protect the dojo, then\nthat duty falls to me.[VAR 0114(0033)]

Josée.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Yes, Sensei?[VAR 0114(0033)]
If you didn’t have just as much potential yourself,\nyou would not have been able to hold your own\r\nalongside [VAR 0100(0000)]. In fact...[VAR 0114(0011)]
The only reason I left the dojo unattended was\nbecause I knew you could guard it in my stead.[VAR 0114(0011)]
You recognize the gap between your own skills\nand those of a master, and that very recognition\r\nis proof of your self-awareness—nothing more.[VAR 0114(0011)]
I know that you will continue to grow, Josée.\c\nI’ll be calling on your aid the next time that I must\nturn those Pangoro back myself.[VAR 0114(0011)]

Better watch out—there’s a wild Emolga around\nhere that keeps stealing people’s food.\c\nIt only goes after its favorite Berries, but still! It’s\na huge nuisance.[VAR 0114(018A)]
This Emolga’s a fast little thing, too. No one’s\nbeen able to catch it...[VAR 0114(018A)]
But you’re a big-shot Trainer in the Z-A Royale,\nright?\c\nThink you could battle this Emolga and scare\nsome sense into it?[VAR 0114(018A)]
I don’t mind if you catch it or defeat it—I just want\nit to leave our food alone![VAR 0114(018A)]
Speaking of, Pecha Berries seem to be this\nEmolga’s favorite. Here—I’ll show you one.[VAR 0114(018A)]
Molgaaa!
Wha—?! That puny pest pilfered my Pecha Berry![VAR 0114(018A)]
Chase after that Emolga, would you? You should\nbe able to catch up to it using Roto-Glide![VAR 0114(018A)]

Though I guess Emolga will probably just keep on\npilfering food from other places in the city...[VAR 0114(018A)]
I can’t really blame it. Pokémon and people are all\njust doing what we can to survive, eh?[VAR 0114(018A)]
Can you let Emolga out of its ball? I’d like to get a\ngood look at our little thief.[VAR 0114(018A)]
Mol...
Hmph. I’ll admit—you’re one tough Emolga! It\ncan’t have been easy surviving in this city.[VAR 0114(018A)]
I’m sure Emolga didn’t think it was doing\nanything wrong. It was just gathering food.\c\nPokémon and people aren’t so different in that\nrespect. We’re all doing what we can to get by.[VAR 0114(018A)]

What is my dream, you ask?[VAR 0114(018B)]
Bergmite sur un Avalugg![VAR 0114(018B)]
Yes, that’s right—I want to see all my Bergmite sit\non the back of a giant Avalugg![VAR 0114(018B)]
Brrrg!
You strike me as a capable Trainer, and so I have\none very, VERY serious request for you.[VAR 0114(018B)]
I’d like to borrow an Avalugg big enough to fit all\nfour of my Bergmite on its back.\c\nI think one with a size classification of XL should\nbe big enough.[VAR 0114(018B)]
[~ 8]
Do you have an XL Avalugg that my four Bergmite\ncan ride on?[VAR 0114(018B)]
Just as a reminder, I’m looking for an Avalugg big\nenough to fit my four Bergmite babies on its back.\r\nAn XL-sized Avalugg, to be exact![VAR 0114(018B)]
That one’s not quite big enough...\c\nI don’t think anything less than an XL Avalugg\nhas enough room to fit all four of my Bergmite.[VAR 0114(018B)]
I’m really sorry, but a Hisuian Avalugg’s not\nexactly what I’m going for.[VAR 0114(018B)]
Wooow...[VAR 0114(018B)]
It’s huge![VAR 0114(018B)]
This alpha’s MASSIVE![VAR 0114(018B)]
It should fit all my Bergmite for sure! Are you\nready, my babies?[VAR 0114(018B)]
Brrrg!
Oh, just look—all four of them fit on Avalugg’s\nback![VAR 0114(018B)]
This is exactly what I wanted to see! My dream’s\ncome true![VAR 0114(018B)]
Oh, wait, let me take some photos! I need to post\nthis on all my socials![VAR 0114(018B)]
Wait, what’s happening...? No way![VAR 0114(018B)]
This is wild! My pictures are going viral![VAR 0114(018B)]
I had no idea so many people wanted to see the\nvery same thing I’d dreamed of![VAR 0114(018B)]
I’m glad so many people have gotten to see how\ngreat Bergmite and Avalugg are!\c\nAnd it’s all thanks to you. I couldn’t have done\nany of this without your XL Avalugg.[VAR 0114(018B)]
I’m glad so many people have gotten to see how\ngreat Bergmite and Avalugg are!\c\nAnd it’s all thanks to you. I couldn’t have done\nany of this without your alpha Avalugg.[VAR 0114(018B)]
[~ 26]
I’m so happy that so many people have come to\nlove my favorite Ice-type Pokémon![VAR 0114(018B)]

Thanks again to you and the Rust Syndicate for\nyour help the other day.[VAR 0114(018C)]
Remember that Gengar I said I’d look after?\nWell...I haven’t seen it for a while.[VAR 0114(018C)]
It’s a wild Pokémon, so I know it’s gonna come\nand go as it pleases...[VAR 0114(018C)]
But I’d gotten used to having it around. And, if\nI’m being honest, I’m kinda worried about it.[VAR 0114(018C)]
I know it’s a weird ask, but do you think you could\nhelp me look for Gengar? It’d mean a lot.[VAR 0114(018C)]
We’ll need help from a Ghost-type expert too.\c\nLet’s go see if Gwynn from the Fist of Justice can\nlend a hand! She should be at the dojo.[VAR 0114(018C)]
[~ 7]
...So you need my help.[VAR 0114(0012)]
I’ll do it on one condition.[VAR 0114(0012)]
Battle me.[VAR 0114(0012)]
You’re going down!
I don’t feel like it...
Then you deserve to be stuck.[VAR 0114(0012)]
Revenge will be mine.[VAR 0114(0012)]
[~ 15]
[~ 16]
You really are strong...[VAR 0114(0012)]
You. Explain why you need my help. And keep it\nbrief.[VAR 0114(0012)]
Hm... I see why you’re concerned.[VAR 0114(0012)]
Still, now we have an idea of the sort of Gengar\nwe’re dealing with.[VAR 0114(0012)]
Chandelure should be able to sense where it is.[VAR 0114(0012)]
But know this—some Ghost-type Pokémon like to\nsettle in...and others would much rather roam.[VAR 0114(0012)]
So don’t set your hopes too high.[VAR 0114(0012)]
You’ve been warned.[VAR 0114(0012)]
I get it. I just want to make sure Gengar’s OK.[VAR 0114(018C)]
Do you sense anything, Chandelure?[VAR 0114(0012)]
Shaaa!
This place here?[VAR 0114(0012)]
Shaaa!
Chandelure thinks that Gengar might be at Hotel\nRichissime.[VAR 0114(0012)]
Makes sense. Buildings as old as that one have\ntheir fair share of ghost stories.[VAR 0114(018C)]
I’ll meet you there, then.[VAR 0114(0012)]
[~ 33]
Do you sense anything, Chandelure?[VAR 0114(0012)]
Shaaa!
Ge?!
A Ghost type...but not the right one.[VAR 0114(0012)]
Any other leads, Chandelure?[VAR 0114(0012)]
Shaaa!
This place here?[VAR 0114(0012)]
Shaaa!
Chandelure is pointing us toward a secluded\nwaterway.[VAR 0114(0012)]
Huh. I guess ghosts do tend to congregate near\nrunning water. Sounds legit![VAR 0114(018C)]
I’ll meet you there, then.[VAR 0114(0012)]
Hmm. Gengar never seemed like the type to be\ninterested in Hotel Richissime...[VAR 0114(018C)]
[~ 46]
See if you can sense anything, Chandelure.[VAR 0114(0012)]
Shaaa!
Shuuu!
Just a Shuppet, huh...[VAR 0114(0012)]
Any other leads, Chandelure?[VAR 0114(0012)]
Shaaa!
This place here?[VAR 0114(0012)]
Shaaa!
The Galerie de la Lune? How bizarre...[VAR 0114(0012)]
So Gengar’s developed a taste for haute couture,\nis that it?[VAR 0114(018C)]
If so, it should have gone to the Passage Ombragé.\nMy favorite clothing store, Wisp, is there.[VAR 0114(0012)]
Well...the Galerie de la Lune it is, then![VAR 0114(018C)]
This does feel like a place where Gengar might\nlike to lurk...[VAR 0114(018C)]
[~ 60]
You know what to do, Chandelure.[VAR 0114(0012)]
Shaaa!
Gehe?
Is this your Gengar?[VAR 0114(0012)]
No... Its cry is different.[VAR 0114(018C)]
There you are, Gengar!
Let’s head home, shall we? Tonight I think I’ll\nmake that stew you like!
Gehehe!
Let’s try again, Chandelure. People are counting\non our help.[VAR 0114(0012)]
That’s OK... Let’s call off the search.[VAR 0114(018C)]
If you and Chandelure are having trouble finding\nGengar, I don’t think there’s much hope.[VAR 0114(018C)]
But...[VAR 0114(0012)]
I should’ve asked Gengar to be my partner while I\nhad the chance...and now it’s too late.[VAR 0114(018C)]
I hadn’t even realized how much I enjoyed having\nGengar around until it left.[VAR 0114(018C)]
But...that’s life, I guess.\c\nThanks so much for helping me search for Gengar\nanyway. I really appreciate it.[VAR 0114(018C)]
After all that...we couldn’t help him...[VAR 0114(0012)]
Heh. It’s funny to think about Gengar having a\nlittle shopping spree and trying on outfits...[VAR 0114(018C)]
[~ 78]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Look, [VAR 0100(0000)]! Gengar came\nback![VAR 0114(018C)]
Geh...
It may wander off again, I know. And maybe\nthat’ll be the last time I ever see it...\c\nBut for now, I’m gonna go all in on appreciating\nthe precious time I get to spend with Gengar.[VAR 0114(018C)]
Don’t worry—I made sure to tell Gwynn that\nGengar came back safe and sound.[VAR 0114(018C)]
Gegeh...

Your Rotom Phone is ringing...
Hey, I need you for something.[VAR 0114(0007)]
Come to the Pokémon Research Lab when you\nhave a moment, would you?[VAR 0114(0007)]
[~ 3]
Thanks for coming.[VAR 0114(0007)]
Have you figured out what it is I need you for?[VAR 0114(0007)]
I have absolutely no idea
Would you just explain?
Well, now! That’s a dull response, isn’t it?[VAR 0114(0007)]
Fine. If you’re going to be so very boring, then I’ll\njust get to the point.\c\nSee, my predecessor left me with a little\nhomework.[VAR 0114(0007)]
He asked me to entrust some of his Pokémon to\nany interesting Trainers I came across in my work.\c\nAnd despite your disappointing reaction just now,\nyou’re generally pretty interesting.[VAR 0114(0007)]
But it seems you’re in no position to take any\nmore Pokémon with you.\c\nGo through your Boxes, then come see me again.[VAR 0114(0007)]
Pokémon. Present yourselves well.[VAR 0114(0007)]
Don’t be shy! Go on and choose one.[VAR 0114(0007)]
That’s the Fire-type Pokémon Charmander.[VAR 0114(0007)]
That’s the Water-type Pokémon Squirtle.[VAR 0114(0007)]
That’s the Grass-type Pokémon Bulbasaur.[VAR 0114(0007)]
I told you to choose a Pokémon![VAR 0114(0007)]
So [VAR 0101(0002)]’s the one you want?[VAR 0114(0007)]
It sure is!
Hold on...
[VAR BD06(0000)]You’d better not let me down for thinking you’re\nactually any fun. Show this [VAR 0101(0002)] a\r\nwide\r\nworld\r\nof\r\nnew\r\nsights\r\nand\r\nexperiences![VAR 0114(0007)]

Mimi seems interested in your Diancite...
Murrr-mrrrawr?
Mrawp!
Mimi must be sensing some kind of psychic\nenergy.[VAR 0114(0008)]
It can telepathically pick up thoughts and feelings\nand transmit them to another person.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Using telepathy takes a lot out of Mimi, so I’ve\nasked it to hold back.\c\nBut even so, sometimes it happens to pick up on\nsomething—like just now.[VAR 0114(0008)]
I wonder what it’s detecting.\c\nMaybe that Diancite you’ve got is imbued with\nsome kind of strong emotion?[VAR 0114(0008)]
Why don’t we follow Mimi and see where it’s\nheaded, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0008)]
[~ 9]
I think Mimi’s picking up on something.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Hold on a sec.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Hi, Sedna?[VAR 0114(0008)]
Mimi and I are on a case right now, and we might\nneed your help.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Yeah, if you could let Eris and Nix know too, that\nwould be great.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Sorry about that. I was just checking in with\nsome friends from back in the day.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Back in the day?
Old friends, huh?
Yeah. You see, I run the bureau now, but it was\nstarted by a detective named Looker.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Is that why it’s called the Looker Bureau?
Oh, is that who your office is named after?
Exactly! He was such a kind person and helped\nteach me so much...[VAR 0114(0008)]
But it turned out he wasn’t any ordinary private\ndetective—he was an International Police officer!\c\nSo eventually, he had to go off and solve more\ncases somewhere else—far away, probably.[VAR 0114(0008)]
I took over for him as head of the bureau, and I’m\ndoing my best to run things with the help of Mimi\r\nand those friends I just spoke to.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Mimi has been particularly helpful. Its telepathy\nhas helped solve so many cases![VAR 0114(0008)]
But like I said, it gets worn out if it uses those\npowers too much.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Murrr-mrrrawr?
Mrawp!
[VAR BD06(0000)]Come on, [VAR 0100(0000)]. Let’s follow\nMimi![VAR 0114(0008)]
[~ 29]
What is it, Mimi? Wait—were you picking up on\nmy own feelings?[VAR 0114(0008)]
Is this Mimi’s mystical power?
Somehow you can hear Emma’s thoughts in\nyour head...\c\n... ... ...\c\n“What’s going on with Mimi? Is it hungry? I’m\ngetting pretty hungry myself...”\c\n... ... ...
Are you all right, Emma?
Are you hungry?
Oh, yes! I was just thinking I could go for a little\nbite to eat.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Mrrrawr.
Thanks for looking out for me, Mimi.[VAR 0114(0008)]
What do you say we make a little pit stop to\nrefuel?[VAR 0114(0008)]
That was delicious, wasn’t it?[VAR 0114(0008)]
Now then, Mimi, how about you show us where\nyou wanted to go?[VAR 0114(0008)]
Murrr-mrrrawr?
Mrawp!
[VAR BD06(0000)]Come on, [VAR 0100(0000)]. Let’s follow![VAR 0114(0008)]
[~ 44]
What’s up, Mimi? What’re you doing in front of\nthat Holovator?[VAR 0114(0008)]
Mrrrawwwrar...
Mrawp!
You want to go up, don’t you?[VAR 0114(0008)]
Mrawr!
I think we’re close to finally unraveling the truth.[VAR 0114(0008)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]We’ll go first. See you up there,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0008)]
[~ 52]
Whatever you were sensing is around here, right,\nMimi?[VAR 0114(0008)]
Mrawr!
There are so many Mega Crystals here... Too\nmany. It’s not normal.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Mrrr-mrrrawwwrrr!
Carbink...[VAR 0114(0008)]
And what’s that other Pokémon?[VAR 0114(0008)]
Maybe it’s related to your Mega Stone somehow?[VAR 0114(0008)]
Mrawr!
The only way to find out whether it’s connected\nto your Mega Stone is to catch it![VAR 0114(0008)]
Mrrraaawwwr!
[~ 63]
Diiiaaa!
[~ 65]
You need to catch it![VAR 0114(0008)]
Don’t defeat it—you need to catch it![VAR 0114(0008)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Good job! I knew you could handle it,\n[VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0008)]
Hey, can I see that Pokémon you just caught?[VAR 0114(0008)]
It’s so pretty...[VAR 0114(0008)]
Its glimmer reminds me of the Anistar Sundial.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Anistar?
Sundial?
Yeah, there’s a strange sundial in Anistar City\nsaid to have something to do with Mega Stones.[VAR 0114(0008)]
This brings so many things to mind...[VAR 0114(0008)]
In particular, I’m thinking about two people I’ve\nmet since I parted ways with Looker.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Namely, AZ and Professor Sycamore.[VAR 0114(0008)]
The professor spoke with AZ as part of his\nresearch into Mega Evolution.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Professor Sycamore’s theory was that Mega\nStones formed three thousand years ago...\c\nwhen certain stones were irradiated by the light—\nthe energy of the Legendary Pokémon—that was\r\nfired from the ultimate weapon.[VAR 0114(0008)]
AZ nodded when he heard that.\c\nAccording to him, that’s why we’ve been finding\nnew types of Mega Stones recently.[VAR 0114(0008)]
After all, the ultimate weapon was fired again five\nyears ago...[VAR 0114(0008)]
Mrrrawrrr...
It’s OK, Mimi. I’m here to keep Lumiose safe. And\n[VAR 0100(0000)] is here to help, too![VAR 0114(0008)]
Make sure you take good care of this Pokémon,\nOK, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0008)]
Lumiose needs people like you. People who can\nreally bond with all sorts of Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0008)]
I guess we’ll head back to the Looker Bureau.\nTake care![VAR 0114(0008)]
Ah! I just remembered that AZ mentioned\nsomething else.[VAR 0114(0008)]
He said during his long journey searching for\nFloette, he saw a phenomenon in Hoenn that may\r\nhave been the beginning of all Mega Evolution![VAR 0114(0008)]
That’s what got him always thinking about the\nbonds between people and Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0008)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Anyway, thanks for helping us out,\n[VAR 0100(0000)].\r\nI’ll\r\nsee\r\nyou\r\naround![VAR 0114(0008)]

Some of the machinery powered back on in\nresponse to your presence...
Initiating security protocols...\c\nMega Stones detected. Restoring power to critical\nsystems.
Activating Project M.\c\nThis project is highly dangerous. Would you still\nlike to release the locks?
Release the locks
Never mind
[VAR BD06(0000)]Now, now, [VAR 0100(0000)], what do\nyou\r\nthink\r\nyou’re\r\ndoing?[VAR 0114(0007)]
Mewtwo is an extremely dangerous Pokémon.\nYou’re thinking of facing off against that thing?[VAR 0114(0007)]
Then you’d better not fail to catch it![VAR 0114(0007)]
[~ 9]
Catch that Mewtwo! You can’t fail me here, kid![VAR 0114(0007)]
Mew!
[~ 12]
Did you not hear me saying that you HAD to catch\nthat Mewtwo?! I wasn’t kidding around![VAR 0114(0007)]
Yes, we all know you’re strong—no need to show\noff by going and defeating a Legendary Pokémon!\c\nI wanted you to CATCH Mewtwo, not knock it out![VAR 0114(0007)]
Oh, you caught it? Good. One sec...[VAR 0114(0007)]
Oof. Seeing this place in ruins like this...\c\nI gotta tell you—it’s a complicated feeling, no\nmatter how long it’s been.[VAR 0114(0007)]
I figured holo-tech was called for in this situation.\nVoice calls are just so impersonal.[VAR 0114(0007)]
Now then, let Auntie Mable explain to you why\nyou ended up battling Mewtwo in Lysandre Labs![VAR 0114(0007)]
Tell me more, Auntie Mable
I take it you’ve got nothing better to do
Very nice. I do enjoy a good, attentive listener.[VAR 0114(0007)]
Not the reply I was expecting, but whatever! I’m\ntelling you the story anyway.[VAR 0114(0007)]
See, Mewtwo is a Pokémon created by a scientist\nwho was conducting research on Pokémon DNA.[VAR 0114(0007)]
It has formidable power, which piqued Team\nFlare’s interest.\c\nWe wondered if we might be able to use Mewtwo\nin the ultimate weapon.[VAR 0114(0007)]
When we heard it had been spotted in Kalos’s\nUnknown Dungeon, we went and caught it.[VAR 0114(0007)]
Honestly, we still don’t know why Mewtwo had\neven shown up in the Kalos region.[VAR 0114(0007)]
One theory was that Mewtwo came seeking the\npower of Mega Evolution.\c\nBut even with all five of us looking into it, we\ncouldn’t arrive at an answer.[VAR 0114(0007)]
See, we had pieces of both Mewtwonite X and\nMewtwonite Y, but even when we tried using ’em,\r\nMewtwo never Mega Evolved.[VAR 0114(0007)]
Since Mewtwo tends to mostly just hang about,\nsaving up its energy for when it needs to battle...[VAR 0114(0007)]
we put Project M on the back burner and forgot\nabout it.[VAR 0114(0007)]
But Mewtwo sure does like leaving me with\nquestions, doesn’t it? Like, why awaken now?[VAR 0114(0007)]
Was it just reacting to the Mewtwonite X and\nMewtwonite Y you have?[VAR 0114(0007)]
Which leads to the question of why you even have\nthose two Mega Stones in the first place.[VAR 0114(0007)]
But what do I know?[VAR 0114(0007)]
Maybe Mewtwo will be a good little Pokémon and\nlisten obediently to a Trainer with your skills.[VAR 0114(0007)]
Anyway, this acting director still has a pile of\nwork awaiting her.\c\nSo I’m hanging up now. Byeee.[VAR 0114(0007)]

I’m such a huge fan of that event, you know.\nIt’s been a blast taking part in it.[VAR 0114(018D)]
I just love testing out battle strategies against\nother Z-A Royale Trainers, let me tell you.[VAR 0114(018D)]
Kinda weird to see a kid like you holding their\nown in such an intense contest, though.[VAR 0114(018D)]
Maybe too many green newbies are joining in,\nmaking it easy to sail through the lower ranks?[VAR 0114(018D)]
Hm... I’m thinking there’s only one way to know\nwhether you’ve earned your place in the Royale.\c\nThat’s right! Face me in battle, and I’ll give you\na taste of my latest and greatest strategy![VAR 0114(018D)]
Talk to me again when you’re ready to face off![VAR 0114(018D)]
Are you ready to go up against my awesome\nbattle tactics?[VAR 0114(018D)]
I’ll take you on!
I’ll pass, thanks
What?! But Trainers in the Royale love to battle!\nWhy should you be any different?[VAR 0114(018D)]
Here’s a heads-up for you—there’s more to going\non the offensive than just dealing damage![VAR 0114(018D)]
You’re about to see what Pokémon can do when\nthey go into battle armed with Berries![VAR 0114(018D)]
I can’t believe my Berry-based strategy failed...\c\nWhen you have your Pokémon hold an item in\nbattle, it can trigger all sorts of effects, you know.[VAR 0114(018D)]
I’ll award you some Oran Berries for your troubles\ntoday, so give ’em a try![VAR 0114(018D)]
If a Pokémon is holding an Oran Berry in battle\nand its health drops below half, it can eat the\r\nBerry to recover some HP.[VAR 0114(018D)]
I’ll rely on you to help me test my battle strategies\nin the future. You’d better look forward to it.[VAR 0114(018D)]

I’ve been getting a ton more experience through\nthe Infinite Z-A Royale.\c\nI think I’ve got a real shot at winning big![VAR 0114(000C)]
Seriously, what was with that old guy, though? He\nsure never drops that whole mysterious vibe.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Whether [VAR 1100(00FF,0001)]she’s here at the hotel with us or not,\n[VAR 018B(0001)]’s still our team leader![VAR 0114(000C)]
Aw, Naveen. He tries to play it cool, but it’s so\nobvious he’s glad [VAR 018B(0001)]’s here![VAR 0114(000C)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]My favorite part of the Infinite Z-A Royale is\ngonna be more battles with you,\r\n[VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0006)]
When we’re battling in the Infinite Z-A Royale, I’m\njust your rival—forget everything else![VAR 0114(0005)]
I know I’m off playing the big, capable CEO a lot\nof the time now, instead of being around...\c\nBut I wouldn’t be able to focus on that stuff if I\ndidn’t have you all here to count on. So thanks.[VAR 0114(0006)]

It’s a sign for Ansha’s donut shop. Naveen made\nit for her.

A picture of Mimi, Emma’s partner.
These look like files on all the cases Emma’s\nworking on.
The sink is pretty clean. It must not be used very\noften.
It’s a picture of Mimi with a man wearing a suit.\nThey seem to be having fun.
It’s a picture of Mimi with a man wearing\ndistinctive goggles. They seem happy.
If you want to keep winning in the Z-A Royale, pay\nattention to your position on the battlefield.[VAR 0114(0008)]
I’ve received reports about Rogue Mega-Evolved\nPokémon, but I know Team MZ is on the case![VAR 0114(0008)]
Let’s ask around to see if anyone has any\ninformation about Gwynn’s whereabouts.[VAR 0114(0008)]
I’m glad we were able to locate Gwynn. Another\ncase closed![VAR 0114(0008)]
That L person... He always seems to show up with\nZygarde. But why?[VAR 0114(0008)]
I see you’re making your way up the ranks of the\nZ-A Royale pretty smoothly.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Are you using Mega Evolution? It’s useful when\ndealing with Rogue Mega-Evolved Pokémon.\c\nBesides, Trainers need to be Mega Evolving their\nPokémon for the strongest Mega Evolution user\r\nto emerge, as AZ wishes.[VAR 0114(0008)]
I’ve chased down endless leads, but I still can’t\nfigure out what exactly L is trying to achieve.\r\nHonestly, it’s making me doubt myself.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Whatever is going on with Prism Tower, I’ll\nprotect the peace of Lumiose. That’s the promise\r\nI made to Mr. Looker.[VAR 0114(0008)]
There are plenty of people and Pokémon who\nneed help here in Lumiose![VAR 0114(0008)]
All kinds of information about Emma’s various\ncases has been collected here on the whiteboard.

Trade your Colorful Screws\nfor Canari plush here! [VAR BD0A(000A)]Text_icon1
Hey, if you’ve got some Colorful Screws, I’ll trade\nyou a Canari plush for ’em.
Let’s trade!
No, thanks
A Red Canari Plush, eh? I hear those help you get\nmore Exp. Points.
A Gold Canari Plush, eh? I hear those help you\nearn more money.
A Pink Canari Plush, eh? I hear those help you\nfind more Mega Shards.
A Green Canari Plush, eh? I hear those help you\nwithstand more hits from Pokémon.
A Blue Canari Plush, eh? I hear those help you\ncatch Pokémon more easily.
Hey, now. Why’d you come talk to me, then?
And hey—with that, you now own every single\nCanari plush I had to trade!\c\nHere’s some fresh, exciting info for a plush-head\nlike yourself, then.\c\nIf you bring me every last Colorful Screw still out\nthere, I’ll reward you with a giant Canari plush!
Wanna know how many Colorful Screws are left?\nHm... Seems there[VAR 1101(0004,0407)]’s just are [VAR 0201(0004)] more out there!\c\nBring me all of ’em and I’ll let you trade the whole\nbunch for a giant Canari plush!
Jumpin’ Jolteon! You went and brought me every\nlast Colorful Screw there was to find!\c\nThat’s deserving of a giant Canari plush for sure.\nI’ll go ahead and have it delivered to your room.
The giant Canari plush was sent to your room in\nHotel Z!
You’ve already got all the Canari plush, so I don’t\nthink there’s anything else I can help you with...
Come see me if you’ve got more Colorful Screws\nthan ya know what to do with!
It’s a shocking amount of Canari-themed merch.
They’re plush dolls of the Pokémon Eelektross.
Pokémon battles and video games are both great,\ndon’t you think? Even kids can get a taste of glory\r\nwhen they win against adults.
It’s important to give out estimates in writing.\nVerbal agreements just don’t cut it!
Turnin’ regular screws into Colorful Screws takes\na lot more finesse than you may think!
The whole point of our scaffolding courses is to\ngive folks in Lumiose a little fun![VAR 0114(0010)]
Well, if it ain’t the Canari Quiz Whiz h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]imerself! Yer\ngonna be runnin’ the quiz on yer own soon![VAR 0114(0010)]
I started usin’ that hologram of Canari to shield\nher from any weirdo fans, but before I knew it...\r\nI’d gotten hooked on playin’ the part![VAR 0114(0010)]
Those Colorful Screws are our way of havin’ fun—\nand spreadin’ it around too!\c\nGive folks a chance to make happy memories, and\nthey’ll come to love this city even more.[VAR 0114(0010)]
Looks like we’ve got a big job comin’ up![VAR 0114(0010)]
I want the whole world to become fans of my\nscaffolding courses—er, I mean, fans of Canari![VAR 0114(0010)]
Some fans get real excited over Pops’s hologram\nof me. Honestly, I’ve got mixed feelings about it...[VAR 0114(000F)]
I feel for G-Volt. She’s the type that’s always\ncarryin’ the world on her shoulders, y’know?[VAR 0114(000F)]
Hey. You. Fun fact: most streamers don’t like folks\npeekin’ at their monitors.[VAR 0114(000F)]
Folks in Lumiose ain’t gonna be too happy if you\nkeep sleepin’ on the whole Prism Tower dealio.[VAR 0114(000F)]
DYN4MO’s my way of makin’ Lumiose more fun.[VAR 0114(000F)]

Use your Seeds of Mastery\nto get more Plus Moves! [VAR BD0A(000A)]Text_icon1
So you’ve come to the Fist of Justice to become\nstronger, huh? I’m impressed by your dedication\r\nto self-improvement.\c\nIn fact, that kind of dedication deserves a reward![VAR 0114(0033)]
And your reward will be...Plus Moves![VAR 0114(0033)]
Plus Moves?
What moves?
See, if you press [VAR FF00(0008)][VAR BD0A(0004)]Plus[VAR FF00(0000)] before selecting a move for\nyour Pokémon, you’ll be able to use moves they’ve\r\nmastered as Plus Moves!\c\nIt’s a special way to increase the power of moves\nby using Mega Power![VAR 0114(0033)]
Though if you want to unlock more Plus Moves,\nyou’ll need [VAR FF00(0006)]Seeds of Mastery[VAR FF00(0000)].[VAR 0114(0033)]
Do you want to turn one of your Pokémon’s\nmoves into a Plus Move with a Seed of Mastery?[VAR 0114(0033)]
Let’s do it!
No thanks
If you want to upgrade some of your Pokémon’s\nmoves into Plus Moves, just come see me.[VAR 0114(0033)]
Which Pokémon should we look at?[VAR 0114(0033)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Oooh, I’m afraid your [VAR 0101(0002)]\ndoesn’t\r\nknow\r\nany\r\nmoves\r\nI\r\ncan\r\nturn\r\ninto\r\nPlus\r\nMoves\r\nright now.[VAR 0114(0033)]
Which move do you want to turn into a Plus\nMove?[VAR 0114(0033)]
[VAR 0107(0003)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Then I’ll use one of your Seeds of Mastery to turn\n[VAR 0101(0002)]’s\r\n[VAR 0107(0003)]\r\ninto\r\na\r\nPlus\r\nMove.\r\nSound\r\ngood?[VAR 0114(0033)]
Make it a Plus Move
Actually, let’s not
It’s good not to rush into things without thinking.\nI get that.[VAR 0114(0033)]
Then here I go...[VAR 0114(0033)]
Hyaaaaaa![VAR 0114(0033)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Your [VAR 0101(0002)]’s [VAR 0107(0003)]\nmove\r\ncan\r\nnow\r\nbe\r\nused\r\nas\r\na\r\nPlus Move!
It worked like a charm! Do you want to turn any\nother moves into Plus Moves?[VAR 0114(0033)]
I can’t turn your moves into Plus Moves if you\ndon’t have any Seeds of Mastery.[VAR 0114(0033)]

Welcome to Restaurant Le Nah. Our flavors will\nnever overwhelm your palate.
Keep aiming for the top! That’s the ethos I’ve\nalways lived by.
Feel free to take on our\nfull-course feast. [VAR BD0A(000A)]Text_icon1
I feel like I only ever get\ncompliments from myself...
Oh, but your Pokémon must\nsing your praises all the time!
I saved my taste buds\nall for this dessert!
The Crêpes Suzette don’t look all\nthat fancy, yet they’re so delicious!
Watching Pokémon battles while\nyou eat is quite something.
Crummy battles make the\nfood taste crummy, too.
The kids forget all about their\nfood as soon as a battle starts.
I just want to throw a Sitrus Berry\nat whichever Pokémon is losing!
I totally understand.
I don’t know how I’d make it\nthrough the day without this place.
I’d rather be left to enjoy my meal in peace, if you\ndon’t mind.
Chef Roger strikes again! I swear his cooking\nreaches new heights every time I come here.
Sorry, but Siebold is the only chef I know about...
We celebrated our wedding and\nsilver anniversary here, didn’t we?
That goes to show what a long\nand peaceful life we’ve had.
That set menu! Remember?\nWith fish and soup for the entrée...
You were quite the regular here\nback in the day, weren’t you?
The food here is so ordinary\nthat it’s actually impressive.
It’s amazing how they always hit\nthat “sorta tasty” sweet spot.
I wanna eat right NOW! Maybe\nI’ll go get food from the kitchen...
Patience, darling.\nManners maketh man.

Welcome and thanks for coming!\nThis is Restaurant Le Yeah, yeah?
Would you like to take\non our full course? [VAR BD0A(000A)]Text_icon1
Order as much as you\nlike, Sis. I’m buying!
What I’d really like to order is\nthe Pokémon battle du jour!
I know, honey, but it might\nput people off their meals...
I wanna eat with\nmy Pokémon!
They used to have a little spiel they’d give here.\nI think it went something like this.\c\n“Today’s fromage course features the ultimate in\nhard cheese, aged up to 180 years!\c\n“We also have a blue cheese—simply biting into it\ngives off an odor so foul, your nose hairs burn.\c\n“Finally, we have a washed-rind cheese made\nusing a female Arbok’s Toxic poison.”
Dessert is the same as always...\c\nSorbet made from fresh Spelon and Rawst Berries\nwith tangy herbs in a whipped-mousse dressing.
I’d anticipated the quality, but I had no idea the\nquantity of food would also be so generous.
Well, if we can’t manage it all, we’ll take the\nleftovers home for our dear Pokémon.
Daddy... Are we rich now?
So I can order anything at all?\c\nWell then, I’ll have the braciola of fresh Azure Bay\nSlowpoke tail.\c\nIt’s accompanied by Payapa Berry crudités glazed\nin an extra-virgin Oran oil, and has been described\r\nas the gastronomical equivalent of a Gastly\r\nglaring at a Hex Maniac, don’t you know.
Dad’s being way too spend-happy. Did he win big\nin the Z-A Royale or something?
No need to hold back, gang!\nOrder whatever you like!
A good Pokémon battle makes\nthe food taste better, too.
Pokémon battling with all they\nhave—now that’s the best spice!
We’re not grandmama and grandson today, no—\nwe’re just two adults out enjoying a lovely meal!
Oh, don’t worry about me being lonely, dear.\nI enjoy my alone time quite a bit too!
If I stay hidden, maybe the customers will stop\ncalling me over...
You really like to slow down and\nenjoy your meals, don’t you?
Eating slowly is key to getting your\nstomach feeling nice and full.
My Swirlix is cuter by far!
Well, my Aromatisse is much\nmore charming, I assure you!
The meat options here are\noutstanding as always.
Chef Albern’s outdone\nhimself yet again.
I splurged quite a bit on this\nmeal, but I earned it today!
It’s our job as waiters to make sure\nour customers love coming back.

We are proud to offer only the best. Welcome to\nRestaurant Le Wow.
Seeking a luxury full course?\nStep right this way, then. [VAR BD0A(000A)]Text_icon1
Restaurant Le Wow\nis simply, well...wow!
These flavors are to die for.\nI’m so happy to be alive!
I hope we can reach a\nsatisfactory agreement...
Can’t think on empty bellies.\nFirst, some fine dining!
Anything can happen in\nthe world of battling, Mom.
You and your Pokémon\nRULE at battles, Sis!
...Can you really make ends\nmeet as a Pokémon Trainer?
I believe in you, Sis.
Seriously, this jerk at my company is so annoying.\nI just want to wallop him in a Pokémon battle.
Mm-hm, totally. You’re so right.
This crème brûlée is the\ncrème de la crème...
The caramelized top\nis perfection itself!
It’s not every day you find a place that attracts\nPokémon Trainers and gourmets alike.
The owner, Christophe, said this restaurant is his\nway of honing both battles and flavors...\c\nWhen you stop to think about it, it doesn’t make\nmuch sense, does it?
Our meals should only be tasted when perfectly\nready.
You up for a quick\nbattle after we eat?
Sure! Battles are the best\nway to get to know a person.
I trained my partner Pokémon\nto enjoy fancy desserts like I do.
I burned myself out at work today,\nso this is a little pick-me-up.
All I can think about is when\nus waitstaff get to eat, too.
It’s important to experience quality from a young\nage. Now eat up!
It’s not where you eat—it’s who you eat with! As\nlong as the food’s OK, I’d be happy anywhere.
If we get too used to the food at Le Wow, we’ll\nstop being able to enjoy anywhere else...
Well, I’d say that Le Wow’s fine dining gives us a\nbetter understanding of food in general!

At Sushi High Roller, our food rolls right onto the\ntongue!
I know sushi goes bad quickly,\nbut no need to wolf it down.
I ate too fast and\nalmost choked!
Did you know that the fish they use for the sushi\nhere was caught in some far-off region?
Wow! You’re so knowledgeable about these\nthings!\c\n*mutter* The fish is from Azure Bay, though...
Folks are hungry for\nfood AND battles here!
I’m no expert, but is this\nplace meant to be chic?
If you want to eat with your hands,\nwatch how the chef holds sushi!
I love that sushi can also be\nenjoyed in casual settings!
How did anyone even come up\nwith the idea of sushi?
It tastes a bit different from the\nsushi at that place in Alola...
I’m training my grandson’s palate\nso he can surpass me one day...
When I’m older, I wanna be a\nTrainer and a sushi chef too!
Please take your time\nand enjoy your meal.
I’m not quite sure whether the taste of the food\nhere merits the price.
Sushi rolls... What an enchanting combination of\nflavors...
An appetite for trying out new ingredients is vital\nin battles too, don’t you think?
For sure! People should enjoy battling even when\ntheir opponent serves up something unexpected.
So what wouldja like?
It’s not me—it’s the sushi!\nThey just end up in my mouth!
When you’re having sushi, it’s\nhard to know when to stop!
Don’t eat so much\nthat you get sleepy!
My sinuses are on FIRE!\nWhy’s this so spicy?!
That’ll be the wasabi, dear. I hear\nthey use it as a sauce in Paldea.
With so many Pokémon in the city, it’s a golden\nopportunity to do business.
The contract negotiations went well, so we’re\nhere to celebrate!
We’re rolling out Sushi High\nRoller overseas as well!

Hyper Training... [VAR BD0A(000A)]Text_icon1
Entrust your Pokémon to me... If they’re at least\nLv. 50, I’ll put them through Hyper Training.
So...is there a Pokémon you’d like Hyper Trained?
Oh... You don’t have a single Gold Bottle Cap. Nor\nany regular Bottle Caps.
Let’s do it
No thanks
Which Pokémon should we put through Hyper\nTraining...?
Hm. Come again sometime...
Pokémon that haven’t made it to Lv. 50 can’t\nwithstand the strain of Hyper Training...

Do you want to use a Gold Bottle Cap? Or maybe...\nsome regular old Bottle Caps?
Gold Bottle Cap (Inventory: [VAR 0201(0003)])
Bottle Caps (Inventory: [VAR 0201(0004)])
I’ve changed my mind
But you don’t have that...
So you want to train...all your Pokémon’s stats...
Which stats...do you want to work on?
Do you think...you are ready? I’m going to begin.
Looks like that stat’s already...so high...that it\ndoesn’t need any special training.
[VAR BD06(0000)]I’m done... [VAR 0102(0002)] is even\nstronger\r\nnow\r\nthanks\r\nto\r\nmy\r\nHyper Training...

You two are fairly friendly, but I can tell there’s\nstill plenty of room for you to grow closer!
Well, it’s grown somewhat friendly toward you...\nYes, that’s what I’d call this.
Hmmm... I think your relationship may still take\nsome time to build up.
It almost looks like you’ve been letting it get KO’d\nin battles nonstop, but that can’t be right... Right?
What’s this? Are you a disciplinarian? This poor\nPokémon isn’t the least bit friendly toward you!
Come see me again anytime you’d like to know\nhow friendly your Pokémon are toward you!

Welcome to the Lumiose Museum.
We are currently hosting a special exhibition on\nthe second floor.
The Hisui region?\nNever heard of it.
Seems the museum lends their\npieces to far-off regions?
“Farmers and Pokémon”...?\nWhat Pokémon is that?
It lives on forever in art...\nits essence captured in paint.
You can find fossils in the\nGlittering Cave sometimes.
Ah, I remember that Lucario\nstatue from the Tower of Mastery!
That’s one big Lucario! Maybe it’s an alpha?
Lucario was the first Pokémon to ever be Mega\nEvolved in the Kalos region, right?
This old noble had himself painted\nwith a rare Pokémon to show off.
Who’s this guy? And\nwhat’s that Pokémon?
A knight on a training\njourney with his Golurk, huh?
I’m pooped!\nAren’t you?
That means we had\na proper look around.
Is that house...built\ninto the tree itself?
It’s a pretty common\nsight in Laverre City.
So these aristocrats built unique\ncastles in their territories, huh...
This must depict those\nstatues at the Parfum Palace.
It’s a whole series of paintings of power plants in\nKalos. Someone truly loved them, no?
A whole Lumiose City made outta holo-tech?!\nThis is the coolest thing ever!
Prism Tower really is kinda ginormous, huh?
Sheesh, I didn’t even realize there were this many\ndifferent kinds of Poké Balls.
No wonder some people start getting particular\nabout which ball they use for each Pokémon.
I wonder if anyone’s working\non any new kinds of Poké Balls.
Apparently all this stuff is either\nborrowed or modern replicas.
They used to make their\nPoké Balls by hand?!
Hisui is an ancient name for a distant region. The\npeople there greatly feared Pokémon.
It seems that old survey work really led to people\nand Pokémon better understanding one another.
They must’ve reconstructed this\nbased on contemporary records...
They say these Pokémon control\ntime and space even now.
Dialga and Palkia are Legendary\nPokémon in the Sinnoh region.
I was told that the person who wore this outfit\ndonated it to the collection personally.\c\nApparently he gazed a while at those sketches by\nProfessor Laventon with this nostalgic air, too...
[~ 33]
This piece was long believed to have been a\nportrait of a king from three thousand years ago,\r\npainted by an artist who lived after his time.\c\nHowever, recent research has lent support to the\ntheory that this painting in fact depicts a\r\ndescendant of the king’s younger brother.\c\nFrom this, we can surmise that this royal line\nmaintained a degree of power through the ages.
It’s a dark and narrow cave. The source of its\neerie light is a plant called Luminous Moss.\c\nThis work is part of a series depicting sceneries\nthat inspired overseas artists while they were\r\ntraveling in Kalos.
It captures the lives of Pokémon and farmers who\nlived together with the land.\c\nIt was painted about 85 years ago and is regarded\nas an example of naturalism.
The Tower of Mastery stands to the north of\nShalour City.\c\nTwo strange stones were once discovered in this\narea, which are now thought to have been the\r\nfirst known Mega Stone and Key Stone.
The giant Mega Lucario statue that stands within\nthe Tower of Mastery.\c\nIn order to directly view its face, one must climb\nto the second floor of the tower.\c\nWithin the base of the statue is a room that only\nsuccessors or related personnel can enter.
A depiction of the Fruit Pokémon Tsareena and\nthe Scarecrow Pokémon Cacturne.\c\nSome have chosen to explore the figures of\nPokémon—so different than humans—in order to\r\nbetter understand their anatomy and to explore\r\nthe nature of their hearts and minds.
Pokémon sharing a moment together, centered\naround Gothitelle.\c\nMany artists have displayed curiosity about how\nPokémon would relate to each other in the\r\nabsence of humans.
A painting of the Mythical Pokémon Diancie.\c\nThe artist boldly eschews painting a background\naltogether, keeping the focus solely on Diancie.\c\nThus, we can feel the artist’s desire to emphasize\nthat the subject transcends eras and trends.
This is a replica of the Mega Lucario statue in the\nTower of Mastery.\c\nThe original statue was created to commemorate\nthe fact that Lucario was the first Pokémon to\r\never Mega Evolve in the Kalos region.
A shining stone that emitted great warmth was\ndiscovered.\c\nThe Tower of Mastery was then built to house and\nprotect the stone. To this day, the successor to\r\nMega Evolution carries on the legend of the\r\nmysterious stone.
It is said that one only gains their Mega Ring after\ndefeating the successor to Mega Evolution in a\r\nPokémon battle atop the Tower of Mastery.
Only the chosen may climb the Tower of Mastery.\c\nIt also requires skill with roller skates to reach the\ntop floor.\c\nOne must have complete mastery of their own\nbody to become a Mega Evolution user.
It’s a map of the Lumiose Museum. The grand\nexhibition on Hisui is on the second floor.
[~ 47]
They say a man of power at the time forced the\nartist to add the Mythical Pokémon Mew to\r\nspread the word of how great he was.
This painting depicts a knight-errant who\ncontinues his travels with a Pokémon, Golurk.\c\nThe painting expresses the knight’s identity and\nhis suffering as its primary subjects.\c\nIt is regarded as an example of romanticism.
A city that looks like a hideaway for fairies.\c\nA huge tree stands in the center, and the\nPokémon Gym is nestled in the tree.\c\nThis work is part of a series depicting sceneries\nthat inspired overseas artists while they were\r\ntraveling in Kalos.
The courtyard of the Parfum Palace.\c\nA statue that celebrates cooperation between\nPokémon and people stands in the courtyard.\c\nThis work is part of a series depicting sceneries\nthat inspired overseas artists while they were\r\ntraveling in Kalos.
Around the time the Parfum Palace was built,\naristocrats who served the king created unique\r\ncastles in their territories.\c\nThis work is highly praised as a piece that\ncaptures that period in time.
This piece is a key work in the rise of the realist\nmovement.\c\nIt depicts with keen accuracy the scenery in an\narea near Coumarine City in Kalos.
Replicas of the various Poké Balls in use today.

This factory makes Poké Balls and ships them all\nover the Kalos region.\c\nThis painting is part of a series on technology in\nKalos, and the ever-increasing number of\r\nPoké Balls expresses the artist’s desire to be\r\nconnected to all Pokémon.
This power plant uses fire to generate electricity.\c\nThis painting is part of a series on technology in\nKalos, and the fierce combustion fully commu-\r\nnicates the passionate fire of the energy of life.
This plant uses gas from composting waste to\ngenerate electricity.\c\nThis painting is part of a series on technology in\nKalos, and it expresses the sorrow of wanting to\r\nleave some legacy behind, even though we pass\r\non and disappear.
This plant uses heat from the ground to\ngenerate electricity.\c\nThis painting is part of a series on technology in\nKalos, and the plant is a sharp commentary on\r\nthe hidden passion that lies just beneath\r\neveryone’s surface.
This plant gathers sunlight in space in order to\ngenerate electricity.\c\nThis painting is part of a series on technology in\nKalos, and the artist has succeeded in capturing\r\nthe sense of self-efficacy in the region—of being\r\nisolated but still striving to help others.
It’s a three-dimensional map of Lumiose City,\ncreated using holo-tech.
Hisui: The Grand Exhibition\c\nThe lands once known as Hisui reveal how\nhumans and Pokémon came to live in harmony.\c\nWith the help of various museums and collectors,\nwe bring you all the relics—and some replicas—\r\nthat we can from this fascinating place and time.\c\nWe hope you’ll come away from this exhibit with\na sense of the daily life and customs of Hisui.
[~ 64]
Hisui Region Map No. 1\c\nThis map depicts the area around the settlement\nof Jubilife, base of the Galaxy Expedition Team.\c\nMany children can be seen, perhaps indicating\nthat the fear of Pokémon had lessened and life\r\nhad stabilized by this time.
Hisui Region Map No. 2\c\nThis map depicts the Coronet Highlands, as well\nas the Crimson Mirelands and Lake Valor.\c\nThough very different from the modern Sinnoh\nregion, the geography itself is accurately shown.\c\nIt is believed that the surveyor viewed the area\nfrom above while riding upon a flying Pokémon.
Poké Balls of the Hisui Region\c\nPeople of the time crafted their own Poké Balls\nusing Apricorns and the mineral tumblestone.\c\nMany varieties are said to have been crafted, each\ndisplaying different properties depending on what\r\nmaterials were used.\c\nCrafting one’s own Poké Balls in the modern age\nwould be a true labor of love, given the difficulty.
Sketches Drawn by Professor Laventon\c\nHis original Pokédex was long assumed to be\nlost, until a partial facsimile was found in the\r\nshed of a private house in the Sinnoh region.\c\nThis discovery has helped advance the studies of\nProfessor Laventon and the Pokédex he created.\c\nHis work has been reevaluated in recent years,\nwith particular appreciation for his accurate\r\nsketches of Pokémon and his gift for capturing\r\nPokémon’s quirks within his skillful descriptions.\c\nIt is said his Pokédex was not in fact completed by\nLaventon himself but by a mysterious, 15-year-old\r\nyouth who appeared out of nowhere one day.
Crafting Bench\c\nA bench where Galaxy Expedition Team members\nwould craft Poké Balls and other necessities\r\nusing materials they had gathered.\c\nCrafting benches were set up in various locations,\nbut there were also portable crafting kits that\r\ncould be utilized wherever the user might be.
Survey Corps Satchel\c\nA satchel that was supplied to members of the\nGalaxy Team Survey Corps.\c\nShould a Survey Corps member be knocked out\nwhile conducting a survey, the Security Corps\r\nwould rescue them and retrieve their satchel.\c\nTales remain of a Galaxy Expedition Team member\nwho boasted that he could increase the capacity\r\nof satchels so they could hold more items.
Potato Mochi\c\nFood prepared in Hisui by cooking sootfoot roots,\nwhich could be harvested in Hisui at the time.\c\nA recipe has even been found in writings from\nthe period:\c\n“Sootfoot, humble root—harvest it, and peel it.\c\n“Broiled, baked, or steamed will do, just let\nnobody steal it.\c\n“Mash the root, then knead the mash, then once\nmore heat it over.\c\n“Grill it only till it browns—use Ember, not\nFlamethrower.\c\n“Now hearken well, and listen closely—the wise\nadore potato mochi.”
Life Around Jubilife\c\nWithin the settlement of Jubilife, fields were\nestablished to grow crops. Beyond its walls was\r\nthe beach where settlers first came ashore.\c\nAs more Pokémon were surveyed and the area\nwas developed, so too did the population grow.\c\nIt is said that the Pokémon they befriended also\nhelped with various tasks, such as farming.
Model Reproduction of the General Store\c\nThe general store is believed to have played a\ncentral role in providing supplies to the settlers.\c\nThere are records of other enterprises as well,\nsuch as a clothier and a photography studio.
Survey Corps Uniform\c\nThis uniform remained undamaged even when its\nwearer rolled over rough terrain to dodge attacks\r\nfrom wild Pokémon.\c\nIt could withstand both heat and cold and is said\nto have even withstood Pokémon moves.\c\nRemarkably, the red cap is believed to have always\nstayed in place, no matter how the wearer moved.
Survey Corps Uniform\c\nThis uniform remained undamaged even when its\nwearer rolled over rough terrain to dodge attacks\r\nfrom wild Pokémon.\c\nIt could withstand both heat and cold and is said\nto have even withstood Pokémon moves.\c\nRemarkably, the white kerchief was believed to\nnever slip off, no matter how the wearer moved.
The Training Grounds\c\nA space where Galaxy Expedition Team members\nhoned their skills for battling using Pokémon they\r\nhad caught.\c\nIt is worth noting that wild Pokémon were still\nregarded as terrifying creatures at the time.\c\nThere are records of a man named Ingo providing\nguidance in the ways of Pokémon battle, but it is\r\nsaid that he simply vanished one day after stating,\r\n“It’s time for me to return.”
Shop Interiors\c\nAbove is shown the interior of the hairdresser,\nwhile below is the interior of the clothier.\c\nWhile life in Hisui is often regarded as one of\nscarcity, residents were able to live in relative\r\ncomfort by befriending Pokémon, as well as by\r\nusing gathered materials to craft items.\c\nThe hairdresser also seemed to host salons, with\nsome residents gathering to play a game known\r\nas “Go” at the establishment.
House Interior\c\nHere is the interior of a standard house in the\nearly settlement of Jubilife.\c\nThough sparsely furnished, it contains everything\nneeded for fieldwork and daily life, including\r\nhardy clothing, sandals, and boots.\c\nSome houses also contained items the residents\nbrought with them from their home regions.
Hairstyles of the Time\c\nDisplayed here are hairstyles said to have been\navailable at the hairdresser in Jubilife, the early\r\nsettlement home to the Galaxy Expedition Team.\c\nIt is also said that changing one’s hair color was\npossible at this establishment.
Venerated Portraits\c\nPortraits said to have been displayed by the Pearl\nClan and Diamond Clan.\c\nThe individuals depicted within them are said to\nhave represented the sun, sea, and land, but\r\nnothing concrete is known about their identities.
Ancient Sinnoh Hieroglyphs\c\nThese hieroglyphs were used in ancient Sinnoh\nand are said to depict both common Pokémon\r\nand those that were objects of worship.\c\nEach glyph held multiple meanings, and they\ncould be combined to create whole sentences.
“Almighty Sinnoh”\c\nA statue depicting the Spatial Pokémon Palkia,\nworshiped by a group known as the Pearl Clan.\c\nThey referred to it as almighty Sinnoh, the creator\nof the entire world.
“Almighty Sinnoh”\c\nA statue depicting the Temporal Pokémon Dialga,\nworshiped by a group called the Diamond Clan.\c\nThey referred to it as almighty Sinnoh, the creator\nof the entire world.
Formal Attire\c\nThis outfit is said to have been worn by the\nancient Sinnoh people during their rituals.\c\nThis group worshiped the Pokémon Arceus as an\nalmighty deity.\c\nIt is thought that they showed their respect by\nmimicking Arceus’s appearance—even reflected\r\nin the way that they styled their hair.
Temple of Sinnoh\c\nAn artist’s rendition of what the ruins known as\nthe Spear Pillar would look like if restored.\c\nIt is said that these ruins once housed 10 statues\ndepicting Pokémon known as lords or ladies.\c\nHowever, the temple was severely damaged due to\na battle between Legendary Pokémon, with the\r\nstatues also being destroyed.\c\nRecords show that the name “Spear Pillar” was\ncoined by the Survey Corps of the time.
The Commander’s Armor\c\nA suit of armor worn in battle by Kamado, the\nfirst commander of the Galaxy Expedition Team.\c\nIt is said to have come from the Galar region and\nbears a strong resemblance to the armor worn by\r\nWikstrom, an Elite Four member of the Kalos\r\nregion’s Pokémon League.\c\nWhen contacted for comment, Wikstrom said it\nwas possible this armor was one of several suits\r\nhis ancestors gave to Galarians.\c\nHowever, it is difficult to verify such claims, given\nrelations between Kalos and Galar during the era.
Kimono\c\nRecreation of a kimono worn by Kamado, first\ncommander of the Galaxy Expedition Team.\c\nThe kimono uses many different types of thread\nand is ornately decorated, showing that much\r\neffort was put into its creation.\c\nThus it is assumed the kimono was quite costly,\nbut it is unknown whether Kamado acquired it\r\nhimself or if it was given to him as a gift.\c\nThe pattern provides evidence that Golduck could\nbe found at the time the cloth was embroidered.
Galaxy Expedition Team Flag\c\nOne story claims that this flag was meant to show\nthat the Galaxy Team was made up of people from\r\ndifferent regions, and so its design incorporates\r\nvarious elements, including Galarian letters.\c\nHowever, the truth of this tale remains unknown.\c\nThe flag itself seems to have been made using\nthreads from Pokémon.
The Ancient Quarry\c\nAs its name would suggest, this cave was used in\nancient times as a stone quarry.\c\nThe clean cuts on the rock surfaces are signs of\nadvanced techniques or possibly skilled command\r\nof Pokémon.\c\nEither way, the results are impressive even in this\nmodern age.

[~ 1]
Lumiose City awaits! Time to leave through the\nticket gate.
[~ 3]
OK, ready to record! Now all we need is a tourist\nfresh off the train.
OK, we’re good to go!
Hope you three are ready for the spotlight again!
Get ready for the spotlight again, you three!
Chiko!
Sniiirt!
Toh! Toh!
If we’re gonna protect Lumiose, we’ll need a\nbigger team!\c\nSo let’s keep spreading the word about how great\nHotel Z is. And once we get a guest who has what\r\nit takes, we’ll recruit ’em to the cause!
Today’s mission is to add to our ranks!\c\nWe’ll spread the word about how great Hotel Z is,\nand once there’s a guest who looks like they’ve\r\ngot what it takes, we’ll recruit ’em to the cause!
Now we need someone with a real “I’m a tourist”\nlook.
Now we need a tourist who really looks the part.
Hey, you there!
Bingo!
Just pulled into the Gare de Lumiose, am I right?
’Scuse me! Yeah, hi! You just arrived at the\nGare de Lumiose, right?
And judging by that big old travel bag...
And judging by that big old travel bag...
I’ve got a hunch you’re here to see some sights!
I’ve got a hunch you’re a tourist!
That I am
You got it!
You’re just the type I’m looking for!
Phew! If you’d turned out to be a local, I would’ve\nthought I was losing my grip on reality.
And you’re about my height. We’ll look natural\nstanding side by side.
And you’re about my height. We’ll look nice\nstanding side by side.
Listen, could you do me a small favor? For real,\nit’ll be so small.
Listen, before you get to tourist-ing, would you\nmind helping me out with something?
I need you to look into my camera and say\n“Hotel Z’s the best stay in Lumiose!” Easy, right?
I just need to film you saying “Hotel Z’s a hidden\ngem of Lumiose!” Easy, right?
No worries if you’re staying somewhere else! I\njust need a hand advertising the hotel.
No worries if you’re staying somewhere else! I\njust need a hand advertising the hotel.
Sound good? Good! OK, lights, camera...
Sound good? Good! OK, lights, camera...
Ah, shoot. We can’t film with that ad blaring in\nthe background!
Actually, let’s wait a minute. The sound from that\nad is gonna drown everything out.
[~ 39]
I like how that CEO thinks. Even if her ad did keep\nus from filming.

This city and its Pokémon are a wonder. To know\n’em is to love ’em! Anyone who visits gets it.
This city and its Pokémon are a wonder. I know\nyou’ll love them both!
And speaking of people who visit Lumiose, let’s\nget filming!
And on that note, let’s get to filming!
Hold up—where’d your bag go? You don’t look as\ntouristy without it.
Hang on—where’d your bag go?
Did you hire a Pokémon courier service or\nsomething?
So you hired a Pokémon to carry your stuff? Not a\nbad idea.
No, I didn’t!
News to me!
Wait...so your bag got bagnapped?!
Wait, so it snagged your bag?!
I shouldn’t have bugged you with my video stuff...\nMy bad! Come on, I’ll help you get your bag back!
Sorry I distracted you with the video stuff. I’ll\nmake up for it, though! We’ll catch that Pokémon!
[~ 56]
Less talking, more chasing!
Less talking, more chasing!
We gotta catch up to that Pokémon!
The Pokémon kept going down the alley!
That Pokémon went down this alley!
We gotta catch up to that Pokémon!
The Pokémon kept going down the alley!
That Pokémon went down this alley!
[~ 65]
I guess this wasn’t just a wild Pokémon randomly\nmessing with you.
I guess this wasn’t just a wild Pokémon randomly\nmessing with you.
That bag-nabbing Pancham must’ve been with\nthose two.
Seems like the Pancham that scooted off with\nyour stuff belonged to somebody after all.
Listen, tourist—what’s your name?
Hey—what’s your name?
[VAR 0100(0000)]? Got it. I’m Urbain.
And don’t you worry—I’ve got your back here![VAR 0114(0006)]
[VAR BD06(0000)][VAR 0100(0000)]? Got it. My name’s\nTaunie.
We’ll figure this out together—don’t you worry![VAR 0114(0005)]
Come on, Pancham!\c\nEven a backpacker like me wouldn’t be caught\ndead with a bag this tacky![VAR 0114(0004)]
Maybe it was trying to clean up this eyesore. Let’s\nbring it to the cops! Bet they’ll pat us on the back.[VAR 0114(0004)]
No need for that! I’ve got the bag’s owner right\nhere.[VAR 0114(0006)]
That nice bag happens to belong to my tourist\nfriend here![VAR 0114(0005)]
Hey, you’re Urbain![VAR 0114(0004)]
Hey, you’re Taunie![VAR 0114(0004)]
I...can’t say I know you. Did you see one of the\nads I filmed, maybe?[VAR 0114(0006)]
I...can’t say I know you. Did you see one of the\nads I filmed, maybe?[VAR 0114(0005)]
It’s me, Andi! From the [VAR FF00(0006)]Z-A Royale[VAR FF00(0000)]! How could you\nforget already?![VAR 0114(002C)]
Yeah, I’m Andre! We faced off just last night![VAR 0114(002D)]
Oh, Trainers from last night? Sorry, not ringing a\nbell. Must not have been much of a challenge.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Ohhh, now I remember. You two weren’t much of\na challenge.[VAR 0114(0005)]
That stings. But I guess...fair.[VAR 0114(002C)]
Listen up! We’ll return your bag—if you battle us\nright now![VAR 0114(002D)]
That makes no sense. If you want a rematch, all\nyou have to do is wait till nightfall.[VAR 0114(0006)]
That makes no sense. If you want a rematch, all\nyou have to do is wait till nightfall.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Shut up! Pancham’s itching for another shot at\nyou. That’s why it snagged the bag! Uh, probably![VAR 0114(002D)]
It’s nice of you to consider what Pancham wants,\nbut the two of you against me? That’s unfair![VAR 0114(0006)]
I’m glad you care about what Pancham wants, but\nI’m not about to let you battle me two-on-one![VAR 0114(0005)]
Listen. How about I guide you through this mess?\nI’m just a helpful kind of guy, you see.\c\nYour bag got stolen, right? So what’s your next\nstep here?[VAR 0114(0006)]
Listen. How about I guide you through this mess?\nI’m just a helpful kind of gal, really.\c\nYour bag got stolen, right? So what’s your next\nstep here?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Take it back myself!
Battle with Pokémon!
That’s right! And you’ve got three Pokémon right\nhere ready to help![VAR 0114(0006)]
That’s right! And you’ve got three Pokémon right\nhere ready to help![VAR 0114(0005)]
Whatever. Just hurry up or it’ll be night anyway![VAR 0114(002C)]
Hear that? They’re down![VAR 0114(0006)]
Hear that? They’re down![VAR 0114(0005)]
Now choose which Pokémon you’ll battle with![VAR 0114(0006)]
Now choose which Pokémon you’ll battle with![VAR 0114(0005)]
[~ 106]
So, which Pokémon is it gonna be? And before\nyou ask—no, you can’t take all three![VAR 0114(0006)]
So, which Pokémon is it gonna be?[VAR 0114(0005)]
That’s Chikorita, the Leaf Pokémon! It can shoot\nout supersharp leaves![VAR 0114(0006)]
That’s Chikorita, the Leaf Pokémon! It can shoot\nout supersharp leaves![VAR 0114(0005)]
You want to battle alongside [VAR 0101(0002)]?[VAR 0114(0006)]
You want to battle together with [VAR 0101(0002)]?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Yeah, I do!
Let me think
Great! Now, be ready to enjoy your first-ever\nPokémon battle here in Lumiose City![VAR 0114(0006)]
All right! I know all this is a lot, but enjoy your\nfirst-ever Pokémon battle here in Lumiose City![VAR 0114(0005)]
[~ 117]
That’s Tepig, the Fire Pig Pokémon! It breathes\nfantastic flames from its nose![VAR 0114(0006)]

Hold on, hold on—Pancham? It’s already spoken\nfor! You don’t really want it, right?[VAR 0114(0006)]
Uh, that Pancham’s already spoken for! You don’t\nreally want it, right?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Excuse you! Pancham is MY Pokémon![VAR 0114(002C)]
Y-yeah! Think it over...and choose a different\nPokémon!\c\nSheesh, don’t scare me like that. I dunno what I’d\nhave done if you’d tried to pick Pancham...[VAR 0114(002C)]
[~ 128]
Just pick one already. None of ’em have a prayer\nagainst my Pancham.[VAR 0114(002C)]
As if we could lose to someone who’s only now\npicking out their Pokémon.[VAR 0114(002D)]
Where are you going? Don’t you need your bag?[VAR 0114(0006)]
Where are you going? Don’t you need your bag?[VAR 0114(0005)]
[~ 133]
How much longer are you gonna drag your feet?[VAR 0114(002C)]
No longer!
I’m ready!
All that waiting drained my momentum. Time to\nget back into gear![VAR 0114(002C)]
No way am I gonna get beat by a Pokémon first-\ntimer![VAR 0114(002C)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Real quick, I’ll tell you the very basics of Pokémon\nbattles!\c\nYou gotta order your new buddy\n[VAR 0101(0002)]\r\nto\r\nuse\r\nits\r\nmoves\r\nto\r\nattack\r\nthe\r\nother Pokémon!\c\nIf the opposing Pokémon’s HP—hit points—fall to\nzero, you win![VAR 0114(0006)]

You’re going down! Pancham gave us a shot at\nrevenge, and we won’t miss![VAR 0114(002C)]
I respect that spirit. But you’re gonna have egg on\nyour face for real if you lose to a newbie![VAR 0114(0006)]
I respect that spirit. But you’re gonna have egg on\nyour face for real if you lose to a newbie![VAR 0114(0005)]
Hey! Focus up, [VAR 0100(0001)]—you’re dealing with me![VAR 0114(002D)]
Right. I’m sure you got muuuch stronger in the\nday since I beat you![VAR 0114(0006)]
Oh, I know. Hope you’ll put up a little more of a\nfight than you did last time![VAR 0114(0005)]
I know it’s your first match, but you can do this!\nHave faith in your Pokémon’s strength!\c\nYou can always use moves that lower your\nopponent’s Defense, too![VAR 0114(0006)]

That’s good advice. Too bad I’ll beat you before\nyou can use it![VAR 0114(002C)]
[~ 150]
It’s OK! I healed up [VAR 0101(0002)] for you.\c\nThink about mixing in moves that lower the\nopponent’s Defense if you can. It helps a lot![VAR 0114(0006)]

We... We lost...[VAR 0114(002C)]
And to a newbie, at that. I’m more disappointed in\nmyself than in Pancham.[VAR 0114(002C)]
Please tell me you won, Andre![VAR 0114(002C)]
Nope. Can’t believe I thought I’d score a next-day\ncomeback. My Pokémon and I are so let down.[VAR 0114(002D)]
This is why you and I get along so well. We even\nlose together.[VAR 0114(002C)]
If you’re that upset, wait till night falls and come\ntry again![VAR 0114(0006)]
Well, it was good to get some practice! Come\nbattle us again sometime.[VAR 0114(0005)]
No way! We’re not dealing with you again—not\neven if we meet during the Royale!\c\nYou can have your bag back. Pancham says sorry.\nNow au revoir![VAR 0114(002C)]
You retrieved your travel bag!
Don’t leave me hanging![VAR 0114(0006)]
C’mon![VAR 0114(0005)]
Am I missing something?
You want a fist bump?
Yeah, a fist bump! Put them knuckles out![VAR 0114(0006)]

Ugh! I wasted precious nighttime on the most\nuseless opponent in the battle zone!
Yeah, you win some, you lose some. You’ll learn\nabout type matchups and stuff eventually too.[VAR 0114(0006)]

Some of you might wonder why I would suggest\nsuch a “dangerous” thing.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Your concern is understandable. After all, wild\nPokémon are strong. They can be scary.[VAR 0114(0011)]

My knowledge on the matter is that Pokémon can\nremember four moves at a time.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Cultivating a set of four moves rich in power and\nvariety is what leads a Pokémon to grow stronger![VAR 0114(0011)]
Oh! But perhaps I should not be speaking too\nfreely about tactics.\c\nWe may face each other in battle before long,\nafter all.[VAR 0114(0011)]

Take it from me—learning more about the people\nand Pokémon living in Lumiose will give you a leg\r\nup if you’re hoping to win in the Z-A Royale.[VAR 0114(0008)]
I’ll assign you a few cases so you can get a taste\nof detective work and see if you like it![VAR 0114(0008)]
Here are [VAR FF00(0006)]three[VAR FF00(0000)] cases—or [VAR FF00(0006)]side missions[VAR FF00(0000)]—to get\nyou started.\c\nOnce you’ve taken care of all the side missions,\ncome on back to the Looker Bureau.[VAR 0114(0008)]
This’ll be a piece of cake for you! Besides, there’s\nnothing more noble than helping people.\c\nYou should go take care of those cases while I\ncatch up a little with Emma here.[VAR 0114(0006)]
I’m sure you’ll have all three done in no time! And\nnothing’s more noble than helping people.\c\nYou should head out and take care of those cases\nwhile Emma and I go over a few things here.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Once you’ve talked to a client, their request will\nget added to your mission list automatically.\c\nYou can check out your mission list by opening\nyour map with [VAR BD0A(0004)]Plus, then pressing [VAR BD0A(0004)]Sp_1.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Once you’ve talked to a client, their request will\nbe added to your mission list automatically.\c\nYou can check your mission list by opening your\nmap with [VAR BD0A(0004)]Plus, then pressing [VAR BD0A(0004)]Sp_1.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Open your map with [VAR BD0A(0004)]Plus to see where my clients\nare! The white “!” icons mark their locations.\c\nOnce you’ve taken care of all three side missions,\ncome on back to the Looker Bureau.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Murrr-mrrrawr?
[~ 290]
Here, let me share a pro detective tip: Open your\nmap with [VAR BD0A(0004)]Plus, and look for the white “!” icons—\r\nthey mark the locations of folks who need help!\c\nThanks in advance for taking care of those three\nside missions.[VAR 0114(0008)]
...Mrawp.
Seems like you’re making good progress on those\nside missions! You’re really helping these people.[VAR 0114(0008)]
You took care of every side mission? Wow, that’s\namazing! Thanks for your help.[VAR 0114(0008)]
I knew you’d have no problem handling all those\ncases![VAR 0114(0006)]
I knew you’d have no problem handling all those\ncases![VAR 0114(0005)]
We wrapped up our discussion while you were on\nthe job, too.[VAR 0114(0006)]
We wrapped up our discussion while you were on\nthe job, too.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Discussion?
Is it a case?
Well, so... I’m looking for someone.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Well, so... I’m looking for someone.[VAR 0114(0005)]
That’s what brought me to Lumiose, and what I\nasked Emma for help with.[VAR 0114(0006)]
That’s the reason I came to Lumiose, and it’s\nwhat Emma’s looking into for me.[VAR 0114(0005)]
I’ll tell you all about it another time.[VAR 0114(0006)]
I’ll tell you all about it another time.[VAR 0114(0005)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]So, Emma, what do you think?\n[VAR 0100(0000)]’s\r\ngot\r\nreal\r\npromise, right?[VAR 0114(0006)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]So, Emma, what do you think?\n[VAR 0100(0000)]’s\r\ngot\r\nreal\r\npromise, right?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Yeah, you’ve scouted a gem of a Trainer, [VAR 018B(0001)].[VAR 0114(0008)]
In fact, I may just ask h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]imer for help the next time a\ntricky side mission comes in![VAR 0114(0008)]
As thanks for your work today, I’ll share some info\nwith you that all Lumiose Trainers should know.[VAR 0114(0008)]
I’m assuming a Trainer of your skill is already\nfamiliar with Pokémon Evolution, right?[VAR 0114(0008)]
Yup, I know all about it
Not really, to be honest...
Well, some Pokémon can evolve when certain\nconditions are met.[VAR 0114(0008)]
And by evolving, Pokémon get even stronger![VAR 0114(0008)]
Here in Lumiose City, there’s an Evolution that\ntranscends all other Evolution. It’s called...[VAR 0114(0008)]
[VAR FF00(0006)]Mega Evolution[VAR FF00(0000)]![VAR 0114(0008)]
It’ll probably be faster if you see it for yourself\ninstead of having me explain it.[VAR 0114(0008)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Come join me out front, won’t you,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0008)]
C’mon! Let’s follow Emma outside.[VAR 0114(0006)]
C’mon! Let’s follow Emma outside.[VAR 0114(0005)]
...Mrawp.
You’ve got [VAR FF00(0006)]two [VAR FF00(0000)]side missions from Emma left.
You’ve got [VAR FF00(0006)]one [VAR FF00(0000)]side mission from Emma left.
You’ve handled every side mission from Emma.\nHead back to the Looker Bureau and let her know!
[~ 327]
You know, I saw you battle last night, but I’d like\nto judge your strength for myself.[VAR 0114(0008)]
How about it? Will you battle me?[VAR 0114(0008)]
Bring it on!
Let me prepare
Of course! Take your time getting ready.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Pokémon battles help you understand what kind\nof Trainer your opponent is.[VAR 0114(0008)]
If you want to learn about Mega Evolution, then\nshow me your true strength![VAR 0114(0008)]
Bet you can’t wait to see what Emma’s got to\nshow you![VAR 0114(0006)]
I wonder what Emma’s got in store for you![VAR 0114(0005)]
[~ 337]
Thanks for the great battle! I can tell you’re the\ntype of Trainer that I like.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Here—I’ll heal up your hard-working Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0008)]
The Mareep I sent out in battle can evolve into a\nPokémon called Flaaffy, which can then evolve\r\ninto Ampharos.[VAR 0114(0008)]
OK, Ampharos, you’re up next! Come on out![VAR 0114(0008)]
Ampharos, we’re going to demonstrate Mega\nEvolution for [VAR 0100(0000)] now.[VAR 0114(0008)]
With my Key Stone...[VAR 0114(0008)]
and Ampharos’s Mega Stone...[VAR 0114(0008)]
we can Mega Evolve![VAR 0114(0008)]
Let’s go, Ampharos! It’s Mega Evolution time![VAR 0114(0008)]
Amp!
Mega Evolution surpasses the limits of Evolution\nto power up Pokémon even further![VAR 0114(0008)]
Because when a Pokémon Mega Evolves, its\nmoves also get more powerful.[VAR 0114(0008)]
That said, pushing the limits of Evolution means a\nPokémon can’t stay Mega Evolved forever.[VAR 0114(0008)]
See? We gotta try and get that good at using\nMega Evolution too![VAR 0114(0006)]
See? We gotta try and get that good at using\nMega Evolution too![VAR 0114(0005)]
Pokémon are amazing!
Mega Evolution is amazing!
Seriously! Pokémon are so full of potential.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Seriously! Pokémon are so full of potential.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Seriously! And I’m gonna be the strongest Mega\nEvolution user around. Just watch![VAR 0114(0006)]
Seriously! And I’m gonna be the strongest Mega\nEvolution user around. Just watch![VAR 0114(0005)]
You know what, [VAR 0100(0000)]?\c\nI’ve got a feeling that Mega Evolution will find its\nway into your life, just like Hotel Z did.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Anyway, thanks for coming by today, and thanks\nin advance for anything you can do to help out![VAR 0114(0008)]
This city is full of people in need, so if you see\nsomeone in trouble, give them a hand just like\r\nyou did for my clients earlier.\c\nSpeaking of which, I could use your help too.\c\nIf you see a [VAR FF00(0006)]black, four-legged Pokémon[VAR FF00(0000)] around,\nbe sure to let me know![VAR 0114(0008)]
Get in touch if there’s any movement with my\ncase, OK, Emma?[VAR 0114(0006)]
Get in touch if there’s any movement with my\ncase, OK, Emma?[VAR 0114(0005)]

This is a promotion match announcement for\nTrainer [VAR 0100(0000)] (Rank Y).
The opponent for your next promotion match has\nbeen decided.
You are to face Trainer Yvon (Rank Y).
The Trainer who wins will be promoted to [VAR FF00(0006)]Rank X[VAR FF00(0000)].
You got pinged by the Z-A Royale app? Guess you\nknow who your next opponent is.[VAR 0114(0006)]
You got pinged by the Z-A Royale app? Guess you\nknow who your next opponent is.[VAR 0114(0005)]
You should head to the battle zone tonight and\nduke it out with some Trainers to earn points![VAR 0114(0006)]
You should head to the battle zone tonight and\nduke it out with some Trainers to earn points![VAR 0114(0005)]
Good luck! I know you’ll do great.\c\nAfter all, helping out those in need takes as much\nstrength as it does kindness.\c\nSee you around, then.[VAR 0114(0008)]
[~ 374]
You certainly took your time.[VAR 0114(0030)]
Let’s get on with our promotion match already.[VAR 0114(0030)]
I’m ready for you
I need a minute
I’m a busy adult with a lot going on, so I hope we\ncan wrap this up fast.[VAR 0114(0030)]
This’ll be over in no time
I’ll make short work of you
I’ll crush you nice and quick
When I reach Rank A, I’m going to have Lumiose\nCity hold a marathon.\c\nWhich is why I intend to race through this\npromotion match in record time![VAR 0114(0030)]
Don’t take too long, or I might just leave. Is that\nwhat you want, hm?[VAR 0114(0030)]
Run along and get yourself a Challenger’s Ticket.\nThis warm-up is taking far, far too long.[VAR 0114(0030)]
The Z-A Royale, hm? You will likely also come to\nunderstand the meaning of it in time.[VAR 0114(000A)]
[~ 387]
I don’t want to go home a loser—I want to go\nhome a WINNER![VAR 0114(0030)]
[~ 389]
I’m just so annoyed at how hard it is to run freely\naround Lumiose with all the wild zones...[VAR 0114(0030)]
Ugh. Time to jog through every street in this city\nto take my mind off this mortifying loss![VAR 0114(0030)]
Your victory is confirmed!
Congratulations! Now processing your promotion.
You’ve been promoted to [VAR FF00(0006)]Rank X[VAR FF00(0000)]!
Congrats on your promotion![VAR 0114(0006)]
Congrats on your promotion![VAR 0114(0005)]
Looks like you finished what you came here to do,\nso let’s head back to Hotel Z.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Let’s head back to Hotel Z, shall we? You must be\nfeeling drained after that match.[VAR 0114(0005)]
[~ 399]
All right, time to celebrate your promotion![VAR 0114(0006)]
All right, time to celebrate your promotion![VAR 0114(0005)]
Huh? Where’s Naveen?[VAR 0114(0006)]
Is Naveen not back yet?[VAR 0114(0005)]
I’ve asked you more than once to please send\nword when you want us to gather.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Sorry! We weren’t trying to leave you out or\nanything—we just forgot...[VAR 0114(000C)]
Well, I knew you’d come anyway. It’s like you\nalways know when it’s time for us to meet up![VAR 0114(0006)]
We know you always turn up one way or another\nwhen Team MZ’s getting together, Naveen![VAR 0114(0005)]
That’s a very pretty excuse, but I’d rather you just\nadmit you forgot to get in touch.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Aw, don’t be like that! I’ve already made dinner\nfor us and everything![VAR 0114(0006)]
Well, I know how to make it up to you! How about\nwe go enjoy the tasty dinner I made?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Woo-hoo! I thought I smelled your amazing\ncooking, [VAR 018B(0001)]![VAR 0114(000C)]
You sure did! Come on, let’s dig in![VAR 0114(0006)]
You sure did! Come on, let’s dig in![VAR 0114(0005)]
Kyururu.
[~ 415]
The next day...
Your alarm is going off...
[~ 418]
Morning![VAR 0114(000C)]
Congratulations again on your promotion.[VAR 0114(000B)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Hey, [VAR 0100(0000)], question for you:\nWhy\r\ndid\r\nyou\r\njoin\r\nTeam MZ?[VAR 0114(000C)]
I see your instant curiosity about new people has\nbeen activated.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Well, don’t you wanna know more about h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]imer,\nseeing how [VAR 1100(00FF,0100)]she’s tearing it up in the Z-A Royale?[VAR 0114(000C)]
So? Why’d you join Team MZ?[VAR 0114(000C)]
For [VAR 018B(0001)]
For Lumiose
Very admirable.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Bit different from your reason, huh, Naveen?[VAR 0114(000C)]
Leave me out of this, please.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Want to know why Naveen joined Team MZ?[VAR 0114(000C)]
This is an invasion of privacy.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Come on, we’re all on the same team here![VAR 0114(000C)]
I’m not particularly interested in all of your\nbusiness, and I wish you’d stay out of mine.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Fine! Here’s what we’ll do.\c\nYou two have a Pokémon battle, and you’ll have to\nspill the tea if [VAR 0100(0000)] wins.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Why would you suggest that? You know that\nbattling isn’t my forte...[VAR 0114(000B)]
But your partner Pokémon must be itching for a\nbattle, right?[VAR 0114(000C)]
Even so...[VAR 0114(000B)]
OK, it’s settled! Out into the courtyard, you two.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Why do I even bother?[VAR 0114(000B)]
[~ 440]
Lida won’t let this go until we put it to bed, so I\nsuppose I’ll battle you.[VAR 0114(000B)]
But make no mistake—I’m going to give it my all,\nbecause I don’t like to talk about my life.[VAR 0114(000B)]
[VAR 0100(0000)], you ready?[VAR 0114(000C)]
You bet I am!
Gimme a sec
Got it! But make it quick, ’cause I wanna see you\ntwo battle![VAR 0114(000C)]
Scraggy, everyone—let’s do this![VAR 0114(000B)]
Aren’t you curious about Naveen?[VAR 0114(000C)]
[~ 449]
You really want to get to know me this badly?[VAR 0114(000B)]
[~ 451]
Looks like I lost.\c\nNo surprise, given your track record in the Royale.[VAR 0114(000B)]
I suppose I could stand to learn a thing or two\nfrom this. Perhaps I’ll rethink Scraggy’s moves.[VAR 0114(000B)]
That’s something to remember as your Pokémon\ngrow—you’ll need to teach them new moves every\r\nso often as they become able to learn them.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Nice try, but changing the subject won’t work! A\npromise is a promise, so I’ll spill the story for you![VAR 0114(000C)]
Here’s the sitch—Naveen’s grandma won’t let\nhim follow his dreams. Right, Naveen?[VAR 0114(000C)]
She...wanted me to concentrate on improving my\ntest scores. But I was more interested in doing\r\nfashion sketches than academics.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Still, she didn’t have to go and throw away all of\nmy sewing equipment.[VAR 0114(000B)]
So you stormed out of the house, and that’s\nwhen you ran into [VAR 018B(0001)].[VAR 0114(000C)]
Yes. [VAR 1100(00FF,0102)]ShHe told me about Hotel Z and suggested\nusing it as a studio of sorts.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Which is why you hang out here but still have to\nhead home sometimes, huh...[VAR 0114(000C)]
Look, I’m sorry, but there’s something I just\nremembered I have to do. I’ll see you later.[VAR 0114(000B)]
He’s a shy one, all right.[VAR 0114(000C)]
I’m on my way out, too! There’s a café I’ve been\nitching to check out. See ya![VAR 0114(000C)]
[~ 465]
This is a promotion match announcement for\nTrainer [VAR 0100(0000)] (Rank X).
The opponent for your next promotion match has\nbeen decided.
You are to face Trainer Xavi (Rank X).
The Trainer who wins will be promoted to [VAR FF00(0006)]Rank W[VAR FF00(0000)].
[~ 470]
This is X-citing... There’s something that’s just so\n“Rank X” about you![VAR 0114(0031)]
It doesn’t matter if you get what I mean. What\nmatters is...do you want to battle or not?[VAR 0114(0031)]
I’ll battle you
I’d rather not
X is good, but W is better, don’t you think?\c\nFollowing that logic, A is the best. Which is why\nI’m gonna win my way up to Rank A![VAR 0114(0031)]
I’m going to reach Rank A first
You should stay here at Rank X
I don’t get you at all, kid
Heh. Rank X really does suit you! I mean, you’ve\ngot a face that just screams “I love Rank X!”[VAR 0114(0031)]
As X-pected...you really are an “X”![VAR 0114(0031)]
So my next promotion match is against you?\nX-cellent. Now hurry up and get your points so\r\nyou can earn a Challenger’s Ticket.[VAR 0114(0031)]
[~ 482]
This can’t be right—you’re too strong for Rank X![VAR 0114(0031)]
[~ 484]
Are you sure you’re Rank X? You seem way too\ngood at battling.[VAR 0114(0031)]
Your victory is confirmed!
Congratulations! Now processing your promotion.
You’ve been promoted to [VAR FF00(0006)]Rank W[VAR FF00(0000)]!
Just so you know—I don’t care that I lost. The\nletter X is way cooler than the letter W anyway.[VAR 0114(0031)]
You’re Rank W now! Awesome! Come join us all\nback at the hotel.[VAR 0114(0006)]
You’re Rank W now! Amazing! Come join us all\nback at the hotel.[VAR 0114(0005)]
[~ 492]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Here’s to [VAR 0100(0000)] making it to\nthe\r\nnext\r\nrank\r\nonce again![VAR 0114(0006)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Here’s to [VAR 0100(0000)] making it to\nthe\r\nnext\r\nrank\r\nonce again![VAR 0114(0005)]
Oh man, you cooked up another masterpiece,\n[VAR 018B(0001)]! I can’t wait![VAR 0114(000C)]
Lida, you know we’re not celebrating you, right?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Well, it won’t feel like we’re celebrating anyone if\nthe rest of us just sit here quiet and hungry!\c\nNaveen, how about you relax and enjoy some\ncroissant curry?[VAR 0114(000C)]
No, thank you.\c\nCurry and croissants stand alone nicely. But\ntogether, they’re less than the sum of their parts.[VAR 0114(000B)]
But they make a whole new flavor when you put\n’em together. Just like all of us in Team MZ![VAR 0114(000C)]
I’d rather you didn’t compare us to this culinary\natrocity, Lida...[VAR 0114(000B)]
Kyururuuu.
[~ 502]
The next day...
Your alarm is going off...
[~ 505]
Morning![VAR 0114(000C)]
How’s hotel life treating you?[VAR 0114(000C)]
It’s been amazing
Still kinda weird
Heck yeah![VAR 0114(000C)]
Really? We’ll try and make things comfier, then![VAR 0114(000C)]
You know, I came here from far away, just like\nyou! The hotel’s my home these days too.[VAR 0114(000C)]
And it’s such a nice place. I wonder why no one\nelse ever stays here?[VAR 0114(000C)]
Kyururu?
Wouldn’t you like to have more guests, AZ?[VAR 0114(000C)]
I do not mind the quiet.\c\nThis place was intended to be my final residence.\nThat is why I called it Hotel “Z.”[VAR 0114(000A)]
And if the hotel were to become busy, all of you in\nTeam MZ might feel obliged to help out, in turn\r\npreventing you from taking part in the Z-A Royale.[VAR 0114(000A)]
I’m fine with things as they are.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Well, I guess if you’re fine, then it’s fine.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Oh! Sorry, I gotta go practice.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Let’s chat more later, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(000C)]
See ya![VAR 0114(000C)]
Kyururu!!!
What is it, Floette? You seem somehow agitated.[VAR 0114(000A)]
These are...Lida’s belongings, aren’t they?[VAR 0114(000A)]
[VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(000A)]
I am sorry to trouble you, but Lida has forgotten\nher things. Could you deliver them to her?[VAR 0114(000A)]
Perhaps this would be a good opportunity for you\nto speak further with her.\c\nYou are both members of Team MZ. It is good to\nknow your allies well.[VAR 0114(000A)]
You should find Lida in Sector 5 of the Vert\nDistrict.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Perhaps a battle will help you understand more\nabout one another.[VAR 0114(000A)]
[~ 531]
That’s it, Staryu! Looking good![VAR 0114(000C)]
Yu?!
[VAR BD06(0000)]Oh, hey there, [VAR 0100(0000)]. What\nare\r\nyou\r\ndoing here?[VAR 0114(000C)]
I’m here on an errand
You forgot your things
Aw, you brought me my stuff! Thanks so much!\c\nYou seem like you’re always ready to dive in and\nhelp out someone in need—kinda like [VAR 018B(0001)].\r\nIt’s comforting![VAR 0114(000C)]
You’re dealing with a lot yourself though, right?\nTrying to win the Z-A Royale is a big deal!\c\nNot that I haven’t had a bunch happening on my\nend too...[VAR 0114(000C)]
As you can see, what’s “happening” is dancing![VAR 0114(000C)]
I know this great dancer whose footsteps I wanna\nfollow in, so I came to Lumiose for dance school![VAR 0114(000C)]
That’s so cool!
Wow, no way!
Ha, yeah! It’s my favorite thing![VAR 0114(000C)]
But see, the friend I was rooming with at first\nsigned on with a talent agency and had to move.[VAR 0114(000C)]
I was only able to come here at all ’cause I got a\nscholarship. I don’t know how I would’ve been\r\nable to work enough to make rent on my own...[VAR 0114(000C)]
It was right around then that I bumped into\n[VAR 018B(0001)] outside the Gare de Lumiose...\c\nAnd the rest is about the same as your story![VAR 0114(000C)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Someday I want to repay AZ and\n[VAR 018B(0001)]\r\nfor all\r\nthey’ve done for me.[VAR 0114(000C)]
This is kinda random, but can I ask you a favor?[VAR 0114(000C)]
I feel like mixing up our warm-up would really\nhelp me and Staryu pull off a killer performance.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Will you battle us so we can get nice and loose?[VAR 0114(000C)]
OK, sure
Hold on
Sure thing! I did hit you with this out of nowhere![VAR 0114(000C)]
Thanks! Hope you’re ready to get dazzled by\nStaryu’s moves![VAR 0114(000C)]
[~ 555]
Man, you’ve got some moves of your own![VAR 0114(000C)]
[~ 557]
With skills like those, I can see why you’ve been\nkilling it in the Z-A Royale![VAR 0114(000C)]
With you helping out, we might even be able to\nmake AZ’s dream come true.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Let’s keep it up, OK?[VAR 0114(000C)]
This is a promotion match announcement for\nTrainer [VAR 0100(0000)] (Rank W).
The opponent for your next promotion match has\nbeen decided.
You are to face Trainer Rintaro (Rank W).
The Trainer who wins will be promoted to [VAR FF00(0006)]Rank V[VAR FF00(0000)].
Looks like your next opponent works at a\nrestaurant.[VAR 0114(000C)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]You got this, [VAR 0100(0000)]! You’re\nprobably\r\nstrong\r\nenough\r\nto\r\nbe at Rank G already.\c\nThat’s the level when all the other Trainers tend to\nstart using Mega Evolution in battles![VAR 0114(000C)]
Guess you’ve gotta earn Ticket Points, and it’ll be\na while before sunset...[VAR 0114(000C)]
You can always pass some time chillin’ on a\nbench![VAR 0114(000C)]
Now I gotta go find a bite! Even the word\n“restaurant” hits different when I’ve danced\r\nmyself up an appetite...\c\nAnd I just remembered another café I wanted to\ncheck out! Catch you later![VAR 0114(000C)]
[~ 570]
[~ 571]
I’m an excellent waiter. I love collecting Pokémon\nas much as I love waiting tables—maybe more!\c\nDo you understand? I’m saying I’ve collected all\nkinds of Pokémon, which means I’m strong.[VAR 0114(0032)]
Knowing this, do you still wish to sample the pure\npower of my Pokémon?[VAR 0114(0032)]
Sounds tasty
Not right now
May I present our main course for this evening...\nA promotion match![VAR 0114(0032)]
I can already taste victory
Bon appétit and good luck
Main course? Well, I’m starving
I’ll make it to the top of the Z-A Royale, just you\nwait and see!\c\nOnce I’m Rank A, I’m going to make Restaurant\nLe Nah a three-star establishment![VAR 0114(0032)]
Your prudence is praiseworthy.\c\nAfter all, you will need a wide variety of Pokémon\nto contend with my own collection.[VAR 0114(0032)]
Oh? Are you simply here to assess your next\nopponent?\c\nTo know one’s enemy is to know the way to\nvictory, as they say, but if you wish to battle me,\r\nplease earn enough points to obtain a ticket.[VAR 0114(0032)]
[~ 583]
No! I cannot let my dream end here! I WILL have\nmy three-star restaurant![VAR 0114(0032)]
[~ 585]
I bought a variety of Evolution stones to form a\nwell-balanced team, yet we were overpowered...\c\nIn any case, it’s incredible that you could dodge\nmy treasured Pokémon trio’s mix of moves![VAR 0114(0032)]
Your victory is confirmed!
Congratulations! Now processing your promotion.
You’ve been promoted to [VAR FF00(0006)]Rank V[VAR FF00(0000)]!
Feel free to visit our fine establishment again and\nenjoy a nice meal. I look forward to serving you.[VAR 0114(0032)]
[~ 591]
[VAR 0100(0000)]! It’s Emma.\c\nListen, I received a tip that the Pokémon I’ve been\nafter is in your area right now, but—[VAR 0114(0008)]
Zeee!
That cry just now... Did you see what kind of\nPokémon it came from?[VAR 0114(0008)]
It’s a black Pokémon...
It’s a four-legged Pokémon...
Whatever you do, don’t let that Pokémon out of\nyour sight, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0008)]
Based on its cry and your description, I have\nreason to believe the Pokémon near you is...\c\n[VAR FF00(0006)]Zygarde in its 10% Forme[VAR FF00(0000)]![VAR 0114(0008)]
What could it be thinking? We need to find out\nwhy it’s here![VAR 0114(0008)]
I’m heading there now![VAR 0114(0008)]
[VAR BD06(0000)][VAR 0100(0000)], don’t lose sight of\nZygarde![VAR 0114(0008)]
[~ 602]
ZEH!
The mysterious Pokémon carried you to the roof...
...Rrrgh.
[VAR 0100(0000)]! Where’s Zygarde?![VAR 0114(0008)]
Whoa, I’m picking up on a strong surge of Mega\nPower.[VAR 0114(0008)]
That Absol up there... It looks like it’s in pain.\nWe’ve got to help it![VAR 0114(0008)]
But how did you even get up on the roof?[VAR 0114(0008)]
Hm... [VAR 1100(00FF,0201)]HShe needs a Mega Ring.[VAR 0114(000A)]
AZ?! How did you—?[VAR 0114(0008)]
Floette alerted me that there could be another\ncase of [VAR FF00(0006)]Rogue Mega Evolution[VAR FF00(0000)] here.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Time is of the essence. We must leave this battle\nin [VAR 0100(0000)]’s hands.[VAR 0114(000A)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Lucario. Deliver this Mega Ring to\n[VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(000A)]
[VAR BD06(0000)][VAR 0100(0000)]! That Absol is on the\nverge\r\nof\r\nfalling\r\nprey\r\nto\r\n[VAR FF00(0006)]Rogue Mega Evolution[VAR FF00(0000)]!\c\nTo defeat a Rogue Mega-Evolved Pokémon, you\nmust wield the power of Mega Evolution yourself![VAR 0114(000A)]
Groof!
Groof!
You received a Mega Ring from Lucario!
Remember what I told you about Mega Evolution![VAR 0114(0008)]
[VAR BD06(0000)][VAR 0100(0000)]! Put on the Mega\nRing![VAR 0114(000A)]
[~ 621]
We’ll advise you from here![VAR 0114(0008)]
To face down a Rogue Mega-Evolved Pokémon,\nyou must also use Mega Evolution.[VAR 0114(000A)]
The Mega Ring I gave you can hold Mega Power\nwithin it.[VAR 0114(000A)]
When you attack Rogue Mega-Evolved Pokémon,\norbs of Mega Power will spill out of them![VAR 0114(0008)]
Gather as many of those orbs as you can, and\nonce you’ve maxed out your Mega Power...[VAR 0114(0008)]
...Use [VAR BD0A(000C)]Stick_R_Push to have Lucario Mega Evolve for you![VAR 0114(000A)]
And there is one more thing you must remember.\c\nYou must not let yourself fall during the battle.\nDodge your foe’s attacks if they might strike you![VAR 0114(000A)]
FWOOOR!
[~ 630]
You were defeated by the Rogue Mega Absol...\c\nGather orbs of Mega Power while dodging the\nopponent’s attacks, then Mega Evolve Lucario!
[~ 632]
You pacified the Rogue Mega Absol!
You obtained an Absolite stone!
Wow, [VAR 0100(0000)]! Incredible!\c\nYou really are an amazing Trainer. I can’t believe\nyou managed to pacify that Rogue Mega Absol.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Do you get how big of a deal this is? You saved\nAbsol from the pain of Rogue Mega Evolution![VAR 0114(0008)]
But I wonder why Zygarde led you here in the\nfirst place?[VAR 0114(0008)]
AZ! Sorry I’m late![VAR 0114(0006)]
AZ! Sorry I’m late![VAR 0114(0005)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Huh? Emma? [VAR 0100(0000)]? What\nare\r\nyou\r\ndoing here?[VAR 0114(0006)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Huh? Emma? [VAR 0100(0000)]? What\nare\r\nyou\r\ndoing here?[VAR 0114(0005)]

AZ lent h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]imer Lucario and a Mega Ring.[VAR 0114(0008)]
[VAR BD06(0000)][VAR 0100(0000)], let me catch you up\non\r\nwhat’s\r\nbeen\r\ngoing\r\non\r\nso far.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Essentially, the bond between a Pokémon and its\nTrainer is what makes Mega Evolution possible.[VAR 0114(0008)]
But lately, there have been incidents in Lumiose\nwhere wild Pokémon that don’t have a Trainer\r\nare suddenly Mega Evolving on their own.[VAR 0114(0008)]
We’ve been calling this “Rogue Mega Evolution.”[VAR 0114(0008)]
There’s a certain company that’s keeping a close\neye on what’s been happening.\c\nIf we want to get our hands on their information,\nwe’ve gotta keep winning in the Z-A Royale.[VAR 0114(0006)]
There’s a certain company that’s been keeping a\nclose eye on everything happening.\c\nTo get access to their information, we’ve got to\nkeep winning in the Z-A Royale.[VAR 0114(0005)]
That was AZ’s idea, anyway.[VAR 0114(0008)]
AZ’s idea?
What do you mean?
You remember I’ve talked about wanting to\nprotect Lumiose, right?\c\nWell, Rogue Mega Evolution is what we want to\nprotect it from![VAR 0114(0006)]
You remember I’ve talked about wanting to\nprotect Lumiose, right?\c\nWell, Rogue Mega Evolution is what we want to\nprotect it from![VAR 0114(0005)]
Is this Absol the one that Rogue Mega Evolved?[VAR 0114(0006)]
Is this Absol the one that Rogue Mega Evolved?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Indeed.[VAR 0114(000A)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]It seems to be grateful to\n[VAR 0100(0000)]\r\nfor\r\nsaving\r\nit\r\nfrom\r\nits\r\nsuffering.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Some twist of fate has led your paths to cross.\nPerhaps you should keep this Absol at your side.[VAR 0114(000A)]
You caught Absol!
Absol, huh. That’s not a Pokémon that you see\naround very much.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Nice catch! Absol isn’t a Pokémon you see around\nvery much.[VAR 0114(0005)]
They say our lives are defined by our encounters.\nBe sure to cherish this encounter with Absol.[VAR 0114(0008)]
First you win a Z-A Royale promotion match, then\nyou handle a Rogue Mega-Evolved Pokémon...\c\nYou must be exhausted. Let’s head to the hotel\nand kick back![VAR 0114(0006)]

Who will become the strongest Mega Evolution\nuser? Who will ease Lumiose’s great sorrow?[VAR 0114(000A)]

The Dedenne guards are glaring at you. It doesn’t\nlook like you’ll be able to go in.

Boy, does this lobby ever start feeling empty when\nLida and Naveen are both gone.[VAR 0114(0005)]

Absol’s the only Pokémon you can Mega Evolve,\nthough. Put it in your party or we’ll get nowhere![VAR 0114(0005)]
Better give Absol an Absolite stone if you want it\nto be able to Mega Evolve![VAR 0114(0006)]
You need Absol to hold an Absolite stone if you\nwant it to Mega Evolve![VAR 0114(0005)]
Hey, hang on! Let’s have a Pokémon battle before\nwe head to Quasartico![VAR 0114(0006)]

Makes sense. I doubt Dedenne get to be security\nguards unless they’re really strong!\c\nBut still, we shouldn’t keep Vinnie waiting long...[VAR 0114(0005)]

Dedenne...
Dede...
Given our aims to coexist with Pokémon here in\nLumiose, it seems fitting to employ some of them\r\nas guards—but it’s less ideal if they’re defeated.
If you don’t mind my asking, do you have an\nappointment here?
Vinnie asked us to come.[VAR 0114(0006)]
We’ve been invited by Vinnie.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Vinnie?\c\nAs in, the CEO’s secretary? He called for...you?
That’s correct. I did.[VAR 0114(000E)]
We have some important business to discuss.\nBusiness that will impact Quasartico Inc.[VAR 0114(000E)]
I’m sorry to rush you when you just wrapped up\nyour battle with our guard Dedenne, but please\r\njoin me at the battle court beside our building.[VAR 0114(000E)]

And now I must indulge in a little story time.[VAR 0114(000E)]
Last night, our organization detected a certain\nenergy that we have been on the lookout for.\r\nWe headed to the source of the energy at once.[VAR 0114(000E)]
However, by the time we arrived at the site, it\nappeared someone had resolved the matter for us.[VAR 0114(000E)]
Allow me to be direct in my inquiry.[VAR 0114(000E)]
Do you know what became of the Absol that\nunderwent Rogue Mega Evolution?[VAR 0114(000E)]
I calmed it down
It’s with me now
Superbly done![VAR 0114(000E)]
Where’s all this headed, Vinnie?[VAR 0114(0006)]
Where’s this going, Vinnie?[VAR 0114(0005)]
As you know, Quasartico Inc. has been tasked\nwith carrying out this city’s redevelopment.[VAR 0114(000E)]
We became aware that these cases of Rogue\nMega Evolution could impede our goals.\c\nAs a result, we’ve been quietly working in the\nbackground to try to take care of any incidents.[VAR 0114(000E)]
Yet these incidents have only increased, and our\nteams are struggling to respond to them all.[VAR 0114(000E)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]And since [VAR 0100(0000)] managed to\ntake\r\ncare\r\nof\r\nthat\r\nAbsol,\r\nyou\r\nwanted\r\nto\r\ntalk\r\nto her.[VAR 0114(0006)]

Superbly deduced! That is exactly right.[VAR 0114(000E)]
You are truly a Pokémon Trainer worthy of the\nMega Ring that AZ entrusted to you.[VAR 0114(000E)]
Now, as I was saying...[VAR 0114(000E)]
we had to consider creative solutions to our lack\nof internal human resources for this task.[VAR 0114(000E)]
An idea was floated that perhaps we could ask\nstrong Pokémon Trainers in Lumiose for their aid.[VAR 0114(000E)]
That is how the Z-A Royale came to be.[VAR 0114(000E)]
We have provided highly ranked participants with\nMega Rings, partly at the behest of AZ.\c\nHe has made it clear to us that we must locate the\nstrongest Mega Evolution user in the city.[VAR 0114(000E)]
And I’ve been trying to get into the upper ranks\nmyself, hoping that Quasartico would loop me in\r\nabout cases of Rogue Mega Evolution if I did.[VAR 0114(0006)]

While [VAR 0100(0000)] may have already\nreceived\r\na\r\nMega\r\nRing,\r\nwe\r\nhaven’t\r\nyet\r\nhad\r\nthe\r\nchance\r\nto\r\nevaluate\r\nh[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]iser\r\nfitness\r\nfor\r\ntaking\r\ncare\r\nof\r\nRogue\r\nMega\r\nEvolution\r\nincidents\r\non\r\nh[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]iser own.[VAR 0114(000E)]

Yeah! I wanna protect the people and Pokémon of\nLumiose, and that means helping out the poor\r\nPokémon undergoing Rogue Mega Evolution![VAR 0114(0006)]
Yeah! I wanna protect the people and Pokémon of\nLumiose, and that means helping out the poor\r\nPokémon undergoing Rogue Mega Evolution![VAR 0114(0005)]
Looks like we’ll need ourselves some Challenger’s\nTickets, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0006)]
Looks like we’ll need ourselves some Challenger’s\nTickets, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0005)]
[~ 144]
[VAR BD06(0000)][VAR 0100(0000)], if you wish to prove to\nme\r\nhow\r\nstrong\r\nyou\r\nare,\r\nstart\r\nby\r\nobtaining\r\na\r\nChallenger’s Ticket.[VAR 0114(000E)]
So you have a Challenger’s Ticket, do you?[VAR 0114(000E)]
Securing volunteers who will willingly take on\nRogue Mega-Evolved Pokémon is in the best\r\ninterests of Quasartico Inc., of course.\c\nBut I cannot allow a Trainer to face the dangers of\nthis task if they might lack the necessary skill.\c\nNot even one of AZ’s personal acquaintances.[VAR 0114(000E)]
If you believe you’re ready, please prove it to me in\nbattle.\c\nYou should know, however, that I also have the\nskill to defeat Rogue Mega-Evolved Pokémon.[VAR 0114(000E)]
I’ll take you on
I’m not ready
Then let us begin.[VAR 0114(000E)]
I’ll do my best
I’ll show you what I can do!
I’ll win this battle—for Lumiose
I’m sure you won’t mind if I have a bit of fun as\nwell! This is a Pokémon battle, after all![VAR 0114(000E)]
I’ll wait as long as you need, but this battle\ncannot be avoided forever.[VAR 0114(000E)]
[~ 157]
Drampa, I have complete faith in you! Show h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]imer\nwhat you’ve learned over your long life![VAR 0114(000E)]

We won’t be able to work together if you cannot\neven defeat me in battle.\c\nCome face me again once you have improved your\nskills.[VAR 0114(000E)]
[~ 161]
Superbly fought![VAR 0114(000E)]
With this, I can now confidently say that you\nsubduing that Rogue Mega Absol was no fluke.[VAR 0114(000E)]
Now processing your special promotion.
You were specially promoted to [VAR FF00(0006)]Rank F[VAR FF00(0000)]!
Way to go, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nCongrats on reaching Rank F![VAR 0114(0006)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Woo, Rank F! Congrats,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0005)]
Time for me to shoot straight up the ranks, too.\nCan’t let you outdo me![VAR 0114(0006)]
Time for me to shoot straight up the ranks, too![VAR 0114(0005)]
Vinnie, I’m ready for my promotion match![VAR 0114(0006)]
Vinnie, please battle me in a promotion match![VAR 0114(0005)]
You’ve also obtained the necessary Challenger’s\nTicket, [VAR 018B(0001)]?\c\nVery well. Let us begin.[VAR 0114(000E)]
[VAR BD06(0000)][VAR 0100(0000)], [VAR 018B(0001)], I congratulate\nyou\r\nboth\r\non\r\nyour\r\npromotion\r\nto Rank F![VAR 0114(000E)]
Do allow me to heal both of your teams before we\ncontinue on.[VAR 0114(000E)]
And here is a TM for each of you.\c\nConsider having your Pokémon learn the move\nthat it contains.[VAR 0114(000E)]
Now that you have joined the upper ranks, we can\nspeak frankly about our next steps. Please join\r\nme inside as soon as you’re ready.[VAR 0114(000E)]
[~ 177]

Please have a seat.[VAR 0114(000E)]
What a building. If Quasartico’s got the money to\nbuild this, it’s no wonder they got the Z-A Royale\r\nto catch on so quick.[VAR 0114(0006)]
What a building. If Quasartico’s got the cash to\nbuild this, I’m not surprised they got the Z-A\r\nRoyale to catch on so quick.[VAR 0114(0005)]
[VAR 0100(0000)].\c\nYou’ve had your rank raised, but I must confirm:\nDo you agree to lend us your aid to deal with\r\ncases of Rogue Mega Evolution when they arise?[VAR 0114(000E)]
I’ll take care of it
That’s why I’m here
Such superb aplomb![VAR 0114(000E)]
Only a handful of people are aware of the crisis\nthat Lumiose City now faces—including we three.\c\nWhile Quasartico Inc. has been providing highly\nranked Trainers with Mega Rings of our making,\r\nwe’ve not divulged these sensitive truths to them.[VAR 0114(000E)]
We must work in lockstep to resolve this current\ncrisis—without the people of the city coming to\r\nrealize that they were ever in any danger.[VAR 0114(000E)]
It’s honestly amazing we’ve managed to keep it\nfrom them so far. For two entire years...[VAR 0114(000E)]
Two years? What do you mean, two years?[VAR 0114(0006)]
Two years? What do you mean, two years?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Yes, two years ago is when it began for us...[VAR 0114(000E)]
AZ had realized that the city was in peril, so he\napproached Quasartico Inc. with a proposal,\r\nknowing of our urban redevelopment efforts.[VAR 0114(000E)]
He said that Lumiose...was crying out in pain.[VAR 0114(000E)]
Can you even imagine?\c\nThe terror of being on the receiving end of a glare\nfrom that towering giant of a man...[VAR 0114(000E)]
It was clear he was serious about his claims, so\nwe began our own investigations into the matter.[VAR 0114(000E)]
What we discovered was the existence of a\nmysterious power with the potential to trigger\r\nRogue Mega Evolution in Lumiose City.[VAR 0114(000E)]
We’ve been calling it “Mega Power,” but why is it\naccumulating here in Lumiose?\c\nThat is something our efforts still haven’t been\nable to answer.[VAR 0114(000E)]
And then, six months ago...[VAR 0114(000E)]
we witnessed Rogue Mega Evolution occurring\nfor the first time.\c\nAZ and his Floette did their utmost to pacify the\npoor Pokémon together, and yet...[VAR 0114(000E)]
AZ unfortunately lacks the constitution for\nlengthy battles, which left us with little recourse.[VAR 0114(000E)]
That’s when I stepped in to help.[VAR 0114(0006)]
That’s when I stepped in to help.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Wait, you were there?
What do you mean?
I swapped in for AZ and battled alongside Floette\nin his place.[VAR 0114(0006)]
I took AZ’s place and battled alongside Floette.[VAR 0114(0005)]
It took us all by surprise.[VAR 0114(000E)]
I just had to help, y’know?[VAR 0114(0006)]
I was desperate to help him somehow![VAR 0114(0005)]
He’d done so much for me, like putting me up at\nthe hotel. I wanted to repay him. Still do.\c\nBesides, Floette did all the work—she’s a special\nPokémon, and that Light of Ruin move’s amazing![VAR 0114(0006)]
He’s done so much for me, with the hotel and all.\nI knew I had to thank him somehow.\c\nPlus, it was Floette and her Light of Ruin that\nreally saved the day. She’s very special.[VAR 0114(0005)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]That’s how your friend [VAR 0100(0001)] there\nfound out\r\nabout the threat to Lumiose—and what inspired\r\nh[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]erim to create this “Team MZ,” as you call it.\c\n[VAR 1100(00FF,0102)]ShHe has put every effort into reaching the upper\nranks in order to be in a better position to help us\r\ndeal with these cases of Rogue Mega Evolution.[VAR 0114(000E)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]\nAnd now you have made it to those very ranks.\c\n[VAR 0100(0001)]. [VAR 0100(0000)].\nWe\r\nwill\r\nbe\r\ndepending\r\non\r\nyour\r\nstrength.[VAR 0114(000E)]
Vinnie.[VAR 0114(0004)]
Who is that with you?[VAR 0114(0004)]
Madam President. These are the two young\nTrainers who have been working with AZ.[VAR 0114(000E)]
I see. Lovely to meet you both.[VAR 0114(000D)]
I must return to my duties now that President Jett\nhas arrived. Please do excuse me.[VAR 0114(000E)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]So, [VAR 0100(0000)]—now you know\nwhy\r\nit’s\r\nso\r\nimportant\r\nfor\r\nTeam\r\nMZ\r\nto\r\nbe\r\nstrong!\c\nOK, should we think about heading back to the\nhotel?[VAR 0114(0006)]

Excuse me, may I have a moment?[VAR 0114(0004)]
There’s something I’d like to share with you both.
We’ve got nothing left to do here, right? Let’s\nhead out.[VAR 0114(0006)]

Big, fancy corporate buildings like this really put\nme on edge for some reason...[VAR 0114(0006)]
Phew, I was so on edge meeting up in that fancy\nbuilding. I feel like I just ran a marathon![VAR 0114(0005)]
I know how to take that edge off! Let’s go get\nsomething to eat![VAR 0114(0006)]
We should go grab some food.[VAR 0114(0005)]
I’ll meet you at Nouveau Café—that’s the one\nright off Centrico Plaza, remember?[VAR 0114(0006)]

What now?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Hey, Naveen! Mind if we join you for a bite?[VAR 0114(0006)]
Hey, Naveen! Mind if we eat with you?[VAR 0114(0005)]
I’m done eating, actually.\c\nWhat I’d really like is to enjoy some post-meal\nalone time.[VAR 0114(000B)]
But more importantly, are you sure you know\nwhat you’re doing?[VAR 0114(000B)]
What do you mean?[VAR 0114(0006)]
What do you mean?[VAR 0114(0005)]
[VAR BD06(0000)][VAR 0100(0000)], if you keep winning\nyour\r\nway\r\nup\r\nthe\r\nranks\r\nin\r\nthe\r\nZ-A Royale...[VAR 0114(000B)]
eventually you’ll have to face the gamer prodigy—\nthe streaming sensation of the keyboard legions...\r\nYou’re going to have to battle Canari![VAR 0114(000B)]
Canari?
Who?
What? Have you not heard of her?![VAR 0114(000B)]
She’s an electrifying streamer who slings cutting\ncommentary in her snarky-yet-affectionate tone![VAR 0114(000B)]
She’s a bold, vibrant vision in her streetwear! And\nher gameplay—so daring, so dynamic![VAR 0114(000B)]
She’s not just a local Lumiose star, either—her\nstreams and skill are taking all of Kalos by storm![VAR 0114(000B)]
So tell me, do you really plan on battling Canari?\nTHAT Canari? THE Canari?[VAR 0114(000B)]
I mean, yeah! We won’t get to Rank A if we don’t![VAR 0114(0006)]
I mean...yeah! We won’t reach Rank A if we don’t![VAR 0114(0005)]
You mustn’t![VAR 0114(000B)]
A Pokémon battle with Canari? The nerve.[VAR 0114(000B)]
The closest we fans could ever get to her is\nperhaps claiming a Canari plush in exchange for\r\nColorful Screws![VAR 0114(000B)]
It wouldn’t be proper for the likes of us to even\nenter her orbit.[VAR 0114(000B)]
So you probably figured this out, but...Naveen’s a\npretty serious Canari fan.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Sorry about Naveen... He’s a big-time Canari fan.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Though for some reason, he’s not a member of\nCanari’s fan club, DYN4MO.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Though for some reason, he’s not a member of\nCanari’s fan club, DYN4MO.[VAR 0114(0005)]
They’re called DYN4MO ’cause Eelektross,\nCanari’s partner Pokémon, evolves from Tynamo.\c\nAnd the A in their name is a four—to make it\ngamer-y, I guess?[VAR 0114(0006)]
They’re called DYN4MO ’cause Eelektross,\nCanari’s partner Pokémon, evolves from Tynamo.\c\nAnd the A in their name is a four—to make it\ngamer-y, I guess?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Of course I’m not a member of DYN4MO.[VAR 0114(000B)]
If I joined now, they’d think I’m some common\nbandwagoner, not the die-hard fan I am.[VAR 0114(000B)]
There’s more to fandom than being in the official\nclub, anyway!\c\nTo me, what matters is watching all her content\nand learning all there is to know about her...\c\nThen I can design amazing outfits that she could\nwear on her streams![VAR 0114(000B)]
That’s the dream, at least.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Isn’t part of her appeal the fact that she just\nalways wears her own regular clothes on stream?[VAR 0114(0006)]
Isn’t part of her appeal the fact that she just\nalways wears her own regular clothes on stream?[VAR 0114(0005)]

Oop, hold that thought. Vinnie’s calling.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Hold that thought a sec. Vinnie’s calling.[VAR 0114(0005)]

You ready for a strategy meeting?[VAR 0114(000C)]
Let’s start
Gimme a minute
OK! Just let me know when you’re ready.[VAR 0114(000C)]
So we’re dealing with Rogue Mega Evolution...[VAR 0114(000B)]
C’mon, let’s get this strategy meeting underway![VAR 0114(0006)]
C’mon, it’s strategy meeting time![VAR 0114(0005)]
Y’know our dining room? Guess what—it doubles\nas Team MZ’s strategy meeting room![VAR 0114(000C)]
Would you give me a moment before you go in?[VAR 0114(000B)]
No problem. What’s up?[VAR 0114(0006)]
No problem. What’s up?[VAR 0114(0005)]
This should do it.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Thank you all for waiting. You can come in now.[VAR 0114(000B)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Quasartico’s thrown their support behind\n[VAR 018B(0001)]\r\nand [VAR 0100(0000)]...\c\nNow it’s time we start tackling the Rogue Mega\nEvolution problem in earnest.[VAR 0114(000B)]
So I figured we could use something like this.[VAR 0114(000B)]
It’s Team MZ’s flag, complete with our logo.[VAR 0114(000B)]
That’s so cool![VAR 0114(0006)]
Amazing![VAR 0114(0005)]
Naveen really knows his way around a needle and\nthread, huh?[VAR 0114(0006)]
With sewing skills like these, you can see why\neveryone loves Naveen’s work, right?[VAR 0114(0005)]
It looks really awesome!
You’re so talented, Naveen
This is sort of my thing, after all.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Not to be a buzzkill or anything, but should we\nget to the strategy meeting now?[VAR 0114(000C)]
Oh, right! Yeah, let’s get strategizing![VAR 0114(0006)]
I was just gonna say that, Lida. You beat me to it![VAR 0114(0005)]
Hey, welcome back![VAR 0114(000C)]
Even at Nouveau Café, the rest of Team MZ\nfinds me...[VAR 0114(000B)]
Funny that we found Naveen at Nouveau Café. It’s\nlike Team MZ is bound by destiny or something![VAR 0114(0006)]
Do you think Naveen might have been waiting at\nthe café, hoping we’d show up?[VAR 0114(0005)]
[~ 323]
OK, I hereby call this strategy meeting to order![VAR 0114(000C)]
According to the intel we got from Vinnie, Rogue\nMega-Evolving Pokémon are probably going to\r\nappear in three locations.[VAR 0114(000C)]
The first one is Aymlis Park in the Bleu District.\nThis one’s probably gonna be a [VAR FF00(0006)]Slowbro[VAR FF00(0000)].[VAR 0114(000C)]
The second is Jaune Sector 3, where we can\nexpect a [VAR FF00(0006)]Camerupt[VAR FF00(0000)] to be the problem.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Third is Magenta Sector 9, where our target\nshould be a [VAR FF00(0006)]Victreebel[VAR FF00(0000)].[VAR 0114(000C)]
Notice anything, Naveen?[VAR 0114(000C)]
No, nothing in particular.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Come on, Naveen. Nothing at all?[VAR 0114(0006)]
Come on, Naveen. Nothing at all?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Go on then, team leader. Step up and explain it for\neverybody if Naveen’s too distracted![VAR 0114(000C)]
The place where the Slowbro is supposed to go\nrogue in the Bleu District isn’t far from the Stone\r\nEmporium on Vernal Avenue.[VAR 0114(0006)]
The place where the Slowbro is supposed to go\nrogue in the Bleu District isn’t far from the Stone\r\nEmporium on Vernal Avenue.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Ah, I see. If a Rogue Mega-Evolved Pokémon\ndamaged the Stone Emporium, we might not be\r\nable to shop there anymore...\c\nWhich would mean losing a source of valuable\nMega Stones.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Yup, what Naveen said!\c\nWe might wanna stop by the Stone Emporium to\nstock up on Mega Stones sometime soon. I bet\r\nthat’d help us with all these Rogue Pokémon.\c\nWhat do you think, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(000C)]
Do Pokémon usually like stones?
Does the emporium have insurance?
THAT’S your takeaway?[VAR 0114(000C)]
OH NO![VAR 0114(000B)]
What’s up?[VAR 0114(000C)]
I almost missed the start of Canari’s daily stream.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Naveen, we’re literally in the middle of a strategy\nmeeting! Just watch the archived stream later![VAR 0114(000C)]
Clearly you don’t understand.\c\nYou can’t savor being part of the chat when\nyou’re watching from the archive.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Surely you agree, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Oh yeah, totally
Spoken like a true fan
Huh. I guess there’s more to watching a stream\nthan just sitting there looking.[VAR 0114(000C)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Hey, Lida, focus! We’re still in the strategy\nmeeting here!\c\nI think we should split up and each head to a\ndifferent Pokémon’s location.\c\nThen [VAR 0100(0000)] can circle\naround\r\nand\r\nlend\r\nsome\r\nfirepower\r\nat\r\neach\r\nspot.\r\nSound good?[VAR 0114(0006)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Don’t let ’em sidetrack you, Lida! Remember the\nstrategy meeting!\c\nI think we should split up and each head to a\ndifferent Pokémon’s location.\c\nThen [VAR 0100(0000)] can circle\naround\r\nand\r\nlend\r\nsome\r\nfirepower\r\nat\r\neach\r\nspot.\r\nSound good?[VAR 0114(0005)]
How come?[VAR 0114(000C)]
’Cause she’s a super talented Trainer! We’ll all\nfeel better off with her fighting at our sides![VAR 0114(0006)]
’Cause he’s a super talented Trainer! We’ll all feel\nbetter off with him fighting at our sides![VAR 0114(0005)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]I get where [VAR 1100(00FF,0606)]TaunieUrbain’s coming from, but that’s a lot\nof pressure. Are you OK with that plan,\r\n[VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(000C)]
Seems hard, but sure
Let’s give it a try!
If you say so, then I guess...[VAR 0114(000C)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Naveen, make sure you pull your weight! Don’t\njust let [VAR 0100(0000)] handle\r\neverything,\r\ngot it?[VAR 0114(000C)]
NO WAY![VAR 0114(000B)]
What now?[VAR 0114(000C)]
Canari reacted to something I said in chat![VAR 0114(000B)]
Whoa, that’s amaz—[VAR 0114(000C)]
No, wait! Naveen, we’re still in a strategy meeting.\nSeriously, just watch it in the archive![VAR 0114(000C)]
We’ve been over this.\c\nI couldn’t have had that moment in chat just now\nif I were watching it after the fact![VAR 0114(000B)]
Maybe you’ve got a point...[VAR 0114(000C)]
OK, Naveen and Lida!\c\nWe know what Pokémon we’re after and where\nto look for ’em.[VAR 0114(0006)]
OK, Naveen and Lida!\c\nWe know what species of Pokémon we’re after\nand where they’ll be.[VAR 0114(0005)]
And we should all look into the Pokémon species\nthat’re supposed to Rogue Mega Evolve so we’ll\r\nhave some solid strategies to deal with ’em.[VAR 0114(0006)]
And we should all look into the Pokémon species\nthat’re supposed to Rogue Mega Evolve so we’ll\r\nhave some solid strategies to deal with ’em.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Yeah, I guess that makes sense...[VAR 0114(000C)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Well, [VAR 0100(0000)], since you’ll\nhave\r\nthree\r\ntargets,\r\nlet’s\r\nbreak\r\nthis\r\nup\r\ninto\r\nthree\r\nmissions![VAR 0114(000C)]
Number one: Pacify the Rogue Mega-Evolving\nSlowbro at Aymlis Park in the Bleu District!\r\n[VAR 018B(0001)] will head to that one first.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Number two: Pacify the Rogue Mega Camerupt\nthat should be on a rooftop in Jaune Sector 3.\r\nI’ll help take point on this one.[VAR 0114(000C)]
And number three will be Magenta Sector 9’s\nRogue Mega Victreebel. That’s you, Naveen![VAR 0114(000C)]
Rogue Mega Evolution is painful for Pokémon.\c\nIn their pain, they might end up hurting whoever\nor whatever’s around them.\c\nWe’ve got to help everyone we can—Pokémon\nand people alike.[VAR 0114(0006)]

That does it for our strategy meeting!\c\nWanna watch the rest of Canari’s stream\ntogether, Naveen?[VAR 0114(000C)]
No, thank you.\c\nI prefer watching Canari’s streams on my own.[VAR 0114(000B)]
[~ 380]
[VAR BD06(0000)][VAR 0100(0000)]. I received word from\nVinnie.[VAR 0114(000A)]
So you have committed yourself to saving the\nPokémon suffering from Rogue Mega Evolution.\r\nIf that is the case, you should have this.[VAR 0114(000A)]
The final Evolution of the Chikorita you received\nis the Pokémon Meganium.\c\nMeganium is capable of Mega Evolution, if you\ngive it that Meganiumite to hold.[VAR 0114(000A)]
The final Evolution of the Totodile you received is\nthe Pokémon Feraligatr.\c\nFeraligatr is capable of Mega Evolution, if you give\nit that Feraligite to hold.[VAR 0114(000A)]
The final Evolution of the Tepig you received is the\nPokémon Emboar.\c\nEmboar is capable of Mega Evolution, if you give\nit that Emboarite to hold.[VAR 0114(000A)]
And you bear the Mega Ring that I entrusted you\nwith. It contains a mysterious stone known as a\r\nKey Stone.[VAR 0114(000A)]
When a Key Stone resonates with a Pokémon’s\nMega Stone, Mega Evolution becomes possible.[VAR 0114(000A)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]And the way that you achieve this resonance,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]...is\r\nthrough\r\nyour\r\nbonds\r\nwith\r\nyour\r\nPokémon.[VAR 0114(000A)]
I’ve noticed more smiling faces here at the hotel\nsince you arrived, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(000A)]
I think this is because you help bring people and\nPokémon closer together. Even if you don’t realize\r\nit yourself.[VAR 0114(000A)]
But listen well, [VAR 0100(0000)].\c\nPeople and Pokémon finding a way to live\ntogether in this city... It will be the test that\r\ndecides the future survival of both.[VAR 0114(000A)]
That is why we must protect Lumiose’s Pokémon\nand people—to bring about a bright future for all.[VAR 0114(000A)]

Canari wouldn’t be living in some old alleyway!\nWhat do you take her for?![VAR 0114(000B)]

Canari’s most die-hard fans—the “Canatics”—can\nparticipate in an exclusive event...[VAR 0114(000B)]

[VAR BD06(0000)]Well, you won’t have to worry about that.\n[VAR 0100(0000)]\r\nwill\r\nbe\r\nthe one competing.[VAR 0114(000C)]

We’ll need to figure out how to get h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]imer to win.\nThere’s no way we’d know enough even if we\r\nstarted watching her streams right now.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Well, good thing we’ve got a Cannoisseur here![VAR 0114(000C)]
Her name’s not for jokes![VAR 0114(000B)]

The electrical substation, huh? I wonder what that\nplace has got to do with Canari...[VAR 0114(0006)]
The electrical substation, huh? I wonder what that\nplace has got to do with Canari...[VAR 0114(0005)]
The Magenta Pokémon Center is the closest to\nLumiose’s electrical substation.[VAR 0114(000C)]

To win the title of Canari Quiz Whiz, you need to\nlast all three rounds of the contest without\r\ngetting eliminated. The last fan standing wins![VAR 0114(000B)]
There should be somebody handling check-in\nnearby. Talk to them to enter.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Also, you’ll need to say the password in order to\nparticipate in the contest.[VAR 0114(000B)]
If they ask, just say “[VAR FF00(0006)]Let’s go, DYN4MO![VAR FF00(0000)]”[VAR 0114(000B)]
Here, take this earpiece. If you’re seen using your\nRotom Phone, it’ll be a dead giveaway.[VAR 0114(000B)]
I’ll be listening in the whole time, so make sure\nyou behave yourself around Canari.[VAR 0114(000B)]
You don’t seem like you know about the contest,\nlet alone the password to join.
[~ 623]
Hey, you! Where did you come from?!
I get it. Trust me, I’ve seen folks do crazy things to\nto try and meet Canari, but you can’t just ignore\r\nprocedure, y’know?
Whoa, hey! You gotta check in here first, kiddo.
You need to say the password in order to enter\nthe Quiz Whiz Contest.\c\nWhen asked, just say “[VAR FF00(0006)]Let’s go, DYN4MO![VAR FF00(0000)]”[VAR 0114(000B)]
[~ 628]
Usually I work in construction, but I lend a hand\nwith DYN4MO events from time to time.
You looking to enter the contest? Then you gotta\nknow the password!
Well? Go on, then. What’s the password?
It’s
We’re
Let’s
What’s next?
Go
So
No
Finally?
M4GNETON!
DYN4MO!
TYN4MO!
Sorry, kiddo. A word of advice—turn around and\ngo home.
So “Let’s go, DYN4MO!” is your answer, yeah?
Bingo! Clearly you know the password, so you’re\nwelcome to pass on through!
Heh... I can’t wait to get another quiz contest win\nunder my belt.
Yet the question remains: What prize do I ask for?\nShe’s already signed all my Canari plush...
Hm? I haven’t seen you before. Are you perchance\nnew to the DYN4MO community?
Just so you know, the Canari Quiz Whiz Contest\nis very tricky. Even veteran Canatics—that’s what\r\nwe DYN4MO members call ourselves—struggle to\r\nmake it past the first round. New or casual fans\r\nmay not fully enjoy the complexity of—
Watt’s zappin’, gamers?! Get ready for a jolt![VAR 0114(000F)]
Let’s go, DYN4MO![VAR 0114(000F)]
LET’S GO, DYN4MO!!![VAR 0114(000F)]
THUNDER WAAAVE![VAR 0114(000F)]
How’s it goin’, you crazy Canatics?! Who wants to\nmeet me?![VAR 0114(000F)]
WOOOOOO!
What, you all blinded by those stars in your eyes?!\nYou’re meetin’ me right now![VAR 0114(000F)]
WOO-HOOOO!!!
All right, enough of that. Let’s get right to the\nmain event: the Canari Quiz Whiz Contest![VAR 0114(000F)]
Listen up, Canatics—here’s how this works!\c\nThe quiz has three rounds! Get the most right\nanswers every round to move on to the next![VAR 0114(000F)]
Round one’s a simple true-or-false quiz! Go to the\ngreen ✓ area if you think my statement is true,\r\nor the red × area if it’s false![VAR 0114(000F)]
The first round is so simple, I doubt it’ll even\ncount as a warm-up.
QUESTION ONE![VAR 0114(000F)]
True or false? I’m crazy good at falling-block\npuzzle games![VAR 0114(000F)]
Choose ✓ for true or × for false![VAR 0114(000F)]
To make sure you get to the next round, let’s try\nto nail every question.\c\nI’m here as backup if you need it, but for now,\njust pick whichever answer you think is right.[VAR 0114(000B)]
I’ll repeat the question!\c\nI am super amazing at falling-block puzzle games!\nPick ✓ for true or × for false![VAR 0114(000F)]
I’m here as backup if you need it, but for now,\njust pick whichever answer you think is right.[VAR 0114(000B)]
I feel calm, composed,\nand totally confident.
You should join us over here.
Falling-block\npuzzle games...
I’m confident\nin my choice!
Canari’s so cool!
There’s a fifty-fifty\nchance I’m wrong.
Too easy!
I forgot the question, but\nI’m just happy to be here!
Come on, remember...\nYou know this one...
We’re starting off\nwith a tricky one!
I may be new to the community,\nbut I’m confident in my answer.
Oh, Canari... ♥
This one’s easy, even\nfor a noob like me.
Every question in this quiz is a real thinker.
We’re just here to help run the event.
[~ 683]
Nice try, but this prompt is true. Please hurry to\nthe green ✓ zone.[VAR 0114(000B)]
[~ 685]
Time’s up! Let’s see who got it right.[VAR 0114(000F)]
The correct answer is...[VAR 0114(000F)]
TRUE![VAR 0114(000F)]
I could watch those blocks fall aaall day long!\nMost days, I actually do![VAR 0114(000F)]
WOO-HOOOO!!!
QUESTION TWO![VAR 0114(000F)]
True or false? Macarons are my favorite food!\nChoose ✓ for true or × for false![VAR 0114(000F)]
This one’s easy, too.[VAR 0114(000B)]
I’ll repeat the question.\c\nMacarons are my favorite food! Pick ✓ for true or\n× for false![VAR 0114(000F)]
A wise man\nnever wavers.
Do macarons\ntaste good?
I love them, so I hope\nthat Canari does too.
Man, I could really go\nfor a macaron now...
Canari is so cute!
I’ll just copy folks who seem\nlike they know their stuff.
Another easy one!
Well, the last one was true,\nso this one must be false.
Actually, × may be\nthe right answer...
I’ve never heard her\nmention that before.
“Macaron” means\n“to break,” right...?
Oh, Canari... ♥
Canari? Macarons?\nThat’d be unexpected.
[~ 708]
This one is false. Please move to the red × zone.[VAR 0114(000B)]
[~ 710]
Time’s up! Let’s see how you did![VAR 0114(000F)]
The correct answer is...[VAR 0114(000F)]
FALSE![VAR 0114(000F)]
Come on, Canatics. You know I don’t like sweets![VAR 0114(000F)]
WOO-HOOOO!!!
QUESTION THREE![VAR 0114(000F)]
True or false? Electric-type Pokémon are my fave!\nChoose ✓ for true or × for false![VAR 0114(000F)]
Everyone knows how much she loves Eelektross.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Here’s the question again!\c\nElectric types are my favorite! Pick ✓ for true or\n× for false![VAR 0114(000F)]
My victory is assured.
I trust my intuition!
I’m so nervous...
There’s a 50 percent chance\nI got this one right!
Canari IS electric!
So many questions...\nMy brain can’t take it...
Another easy one!
This is the best day ever.
This one’s a freebie.
Eelektross? That evolves\nfrom Eelektrik, right?
If you know Eelektross’s\ntype, this one’s easy.
Oh, Canari... ♥
Maybe getting this one wrong on\npurpose will help me stand out...
[~ 733]
This is true—her partner Pokémon is Eelektross,\nan Electric type. Please move to the green zone.[VAR 0114(000B)]
[~ 735]
Time’s up! Let’s see who got this one.[VAR 0114(000F)]
The correct answer is...[VAR 0114(000F)]
TRUE![VAR 0114(000F)]
No duh-N4MO! Why do you think I wear yellow?\nThat’s me channelin’ the power of Electric types!\c\nAnd of course, my partner’s an Electric type, too![VAR 0114(000F)]
Speakin’ of my partner, I think you’ve all earned a\nspecial treat. Get ready...[VAR 0114(000F)]
for a special guest appearance from your friend\nand mine, the zap-tastic Eeeeeelektross![VAR 0114(000F)]
WOO-HOOOO!!!
Congrats to the Canatics who got all three right!\nYou’re chargin’ ahead to round two. Nice job![VAR 0114(000F)]
WOO-HOOOO!!!
While I pride myself in being Canari’s oldest and\nmost dedicated fan, I must admit you answered\r\nthose questions surprisingly well.
A fluke, no doubt, but maybe your luck will hold!\nLet’s both do our best in round two.
Ugh. People like him are exhausting.[VAR 0114(000B)]
What a tragic lack of self-awareness... Can’t he\nsee that this self-satisfied one-upping only serves\r\nto drive away other fans?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Anyway, let’s get ready for round two.\c\nOnce you’ve prepared, head over to Canari.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Those questions were all reasonably difficult...for\nanyone besides me, of course!
Oh, Canari... ♥
Well, if I got every question right, people might\nthink I’m some kinda Canari maniac...
As a fan, I’m honored to have made it past the\nfirst round!
Man, I was so sure I was right... Maybe it’s the\nquiz that’s wrong?
I was so confident, though! How did I get EVERY\nanswer wrong?!
Canari is so cool! And I got all the questions right!
I got two questions correct! That still makes me a\nCanatic, right?
Yay, it’s Eelektross! Eelektross is the coolest!
I stayed up all night preparing only to wind up\nbeing sabotaged by sleepiness...
I’ve seen all of her videos, but I never remember\nall the little details, you know?
Just getting to see Canari, even as a hologram,\nmakes me happy!
I tried copying the way members of DYN4MO\nusually dress.
[~ 763]
Are you gonna enter round two?
That’s right
I’m not sure
Then why’d you even win round one?
Come on in.
THUNDER WAVE![VAR 0114(000F)]
Let’s go, DYN4MO![VAR 0114(000F)]
LET’S GO, DYN4MO!!![VAR 0114(000F)]
Come on, you crazy Canatics! If you’re amped to\nsee me, make some noise![VAR 0114(000F)]
WOO-HOOOO!!!
Looks like the only ones movin’ on to round two\nof the contest are...[VAR 0114(000F)]
these five Canatics right here![VAR 0114(000F)]
I’ve totally got this!
Once I win, I’ll have Canari sign my most prized\nCanari merch!
Oh, Canari... ♥
It’s my right—nay, my duty—to win! The next\nround is but a pit stop on the path to victory.
It’s Canari Quiz Whiz Contest time!\c\nFor round two, you’ve gotta find the thing I ask\nfor and bring it to me![VAR 0114(000F)]
HERE’S YOUR TASK![VAR 0114(000F)]
My partner, Eelektross the EleFish Pokémon, has\na favorite dessert. You need to find that dessert...[VAR 0114(000F)]
and bring it back here![VAR 0114(000F)]
It can’t be that simple...[VAR 0114(000B)]
The correct answer is a Lumiose Galette, but\nknowing Canari, there must be some twist.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Unless...\c\nI believe I understand what she’s after. For now,\nwe need to go find a Lumiose Galette.[VAR 0114(000B)]
We should head for [VAR FF00(0006)]Café Gallant [VAR FF00(0000)]in Magenta\nSector 1.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Your task is to bring back my partner Eelektross’s\nfavorite dessert![VAR 0114(000F)]
I don’t want to be seen as a Canari maniac, but\nnext time I’ll make sure I pass the first round.
I bet I could’ve won the whole contest if I just\nmade it past round one...
Eelektross loves eating Colorful Screws! For sure.
My gut’s telling me the answer is Hotel Z’s\nfamous special curry.
Even as a hologram, Eelektross is the coolest!
I’m feeling much calmer now that I’ve been\nknocked out of the running.
I’ve seen every one of her videos, so I know the\nanswer to this one.
Eliminated or not, I still got to see a hologram of\nCanari, so I have no complaints.
There aren’t as many people dressed like this as I\nthought there’d be...
[~ 798]
Lumiose Galette secured! My victory is assured!
Now I’ll sprint back at lightning speed!
He’s sprinting back? He could’ve just called a\nLumi Cab...[VAR 0114(000B)]
Still, that fellow is a formidable opponent.[VAR 0114(000B)]
What do you mean?
Why do you think so?
Canari’s Eelektross doesn’t like just any ordinary\nLumiose Galette.[VAR 0114(000B)]
It has to be one that’s been overbaked to a nice,\nfirm crunch.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Lumiose Galettes cure status conditions when\neaten by a Pokémon.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Canari’s Eelektross once ate one during a battle\nto recover from a burn. Apparently, it’s had a real\r\ntaste for them ever since.[VAR 0114(000B)]
After all, what would you say is Eelektross’s most\ndefining trait?[VAR 0114(000B)]
It’s electric?
Its fangs?
Not that you could have known, but no. The\ncorrect answer is its fangs.[VAR 0114(000B)]
I’m impressed! That’s right—its fangs.[VAR 0114(000B)]
It’s pretty rare for Canari to talk about Pokémon\nbattling on her stream, you know.\c\nOnly a fan who’s been watching her since her\nearly days would know the correct answer.[VAR 0114(000B)]
In any case, let’s order the special type of\nLumiose Galette we need.[VAR 0114(000B)]
I’d like my usual Super Lumiose Galette, please.[VAR 0114(000B)]
[VAR 0100(0000)], take this.[VAR 0114(000B)]
That should get you through round two. Let’s\nhead back toward the electrical substation.[VAR 0114(000B)]
[~ 819]
That was a fairly mild task for this contest.
Oh, excuse me! It must have been very difficult for\na casual Canatic—a Canewbie, if you will.
Watt’s zappin’, you crazy Canatics?! Who brought\nback a tasty snack for Eelektross?![VAR 0114(000F)]
What we’re lookin’ for is...[VAR 0114(000F)]
a Lumiose Galette![VAR 0114(000F)]
Obviously.
Oh no!
Yep, a Lumiose Galette. In other words, that was\nanother freebie.
Uh-oh, what’s this? Why’s everyone look so calm?\nDid you all get it right? Dang, guess that one was\r\na little too easy...[VAR 0114(000F)]
OR WAS IT?![VAR 0114(000F)]
You think the Canari Quiz Whiz Contest has any\nfreebie questions? HA! As if![VAR 0114(000F)]
Too bad, so sad, but you got this one W-R-O-N-G![VAR 0114(000F)]
You, superfan. And you, new kid.[VAR 0114(000F)]
Show me those Lumiose Galettes you brought![VAR 0114(000F)]
Well? Wanna tell us what you’ve got there?[VAR 0114(000F)]
It’s a Super Lumiose Galette
It’s the one from Café Gallant
You mentioned it in Episode 231 of “CanaTalk:\nShocking Side Stories,” if I’m not mistaken.
Zappin’ heck, you two. You’re both so...so...[VAR 0114(000F)]
AMAZING! Wow, you totally got it right![VAR 0114(000F)]
Lumiose Galettes are Eelektross’s favorite snack,\nESPECIALLY the overbaked ones![VAR 0114(000F)]
It’s not just about taste—Eelektross loves the\nsolid, crunchy texture those galettes get when\r\nthey’re extra well-done![VAR 0114(000F)]
That’s because my partner here simply loves bitin’\ninto stuff with its fangs!\c\nSo if the Lumiose Galette is too soft, it’s not the\n“toothsome” experience my Eelektross wants![VAR 0114(000F)]
Since you two were the only ones to get that one\nright, guess what?\c\nYou’re both movin’ on to the final round of the\nCanari Quiz Whiz Contest![VAR 0114(000F)]
I’m impressed you’ve managed to keep up with\nme, Canari’s oldest and most knowledgeable fan.
OK, Canatics, one last time![VAR 0114(000F)]
THUNDER WAVE![VAR 0114(000F)]
LET’S GO...[VAR 0114(000F)]
DYN4MOOOOOO!!![VAR 0114(000F)]
I know why all you Canatics are here today! You\nneed my electrifying personality to spark joy in\r\nyour dull lives, right? So lemme ask you this...[VAR 0114(000F)]
WHO’S CHARGED UP?![VAR 0114(000F)]
WOOOOOO!!!
That’s what I like to hear! All right, back to our\nregularly scheduled Canari Quiz Whiz Contest!\c\nThe last round’s got it all—a battle, a quiz, and\nsweet, glorious victory![VAR 0114(000F)]
The rules are simple!\c\nThe remaining two Trainers will battle, and the\nvictor must answer one final question from me!\c\nGet the question right and you’re a winner, baby![VAR 0114(000F)]
I...I couldn’t prove my love to Canari...
I’ve got a feeling those galettes Eelektross loves\nare gonna be in high demand after this!
The final round is here at last... Maybe I’ll start a\nfan club for whoever wins!
As a Canatic, I’m also pretty confident in my\nPokémon battling skills.
I got every single question wrong, but I’ll get this\none thing right for sure: That die-hard Canatic guy\r\nis gonna win the title again!
It’s a shame I got that last one wrong, but I feel\nmore confident now as a fan.
Now I get to brag to everyone that I saw a\nhologram of Canari!
Eelektross looks cool eating anything!
This is turning into probably the most advanced\nCanari Quiz Whiz Contest in history!
Do you think the Quiz Whiz Contest will be\nstreamed on her channel?
Just being here has done wonders for my health!
I need to put more of my heart and soul into\nbeing a member of DYN4MO.
[~ 866]
For a first-timer, you seem to possess a shocking\namount of admiration for Canari.\c\nHowever, even if you defeat me here, there’s no\nchance a non-DYN4MO member like you will be\r\nable to answer her final question.
Do you still wish to battle me, Mani, one of the\nfirst members of DYN4MO and the OG Quiz Whiz?[VAR 0114(0035)]
Of course I do
Not right now
But of course! In fact, why not save us all some\ntime and withdraw from the contest now?[VAR 0114(0035)]
Quizzes aren’t my only talent—my prowess as a\nPokémon Trainer is equally unmatched!\c\nJust like me, my Electric-type Pokémon are as\nfierce as they are adorable![VAR 0114(0035)]
New kid... Superfan... Good luck, and don’t mess\nthis up![VAR 0114(000F)]
[~ 874]
How can my adorable Pokémon lose when they’re\nas shockingly cute as me?![VAR 0114(0035)]
[~ 876]
In terms of cuteness, my team clearly won. But...\nI concede that we did lose the battle.\c\nStill, there’s no hope that you’ll be able to answer\nthe final question of the quiz.\c\nOnce you get it wrong, I’ll swoop in with the right\nanswer and snag the Quiz Whiz crown![VAR 0114(0035)]
All right, it’s time for the final question.\nEverything’s riding on this one![VAR 0114(000F)]
When I was a kid, I played my first games on a\nlaptop. Who owned that laptop?\c\n1) Me　　　　  2) My dad\n3) My mom　   4) My grandpa[VAR 0114(000F)]
1) You
2) Your dad
3) Your mom
4) Your grandpa
The answer is...Canari’s grandpa, number four.\c\nThis one’s a rather deep cut, and the story behind\nit is quite tragic.[VAR 0114(000B)]
I said four, didn’t I? You need to pick correctly, or\nwe’ll be in trouble.[VAR 0114(000B)]
The laptop belonged to my grandpa? Is that your\nfinal answer?[VAR 0114(000F)]
YOU GOT IT! That’s exactly right![VAR 0114(000F)]
[~ 888]
Know what that means, new kid?\c\nYou won the Canari Quiz Whiz Contest! Congrats\nto our fresh-faced underdog![VAR 0114(000F)]
As Canari’s oldest fan...and as a day-one member\nof DYN4MO...I have no choice but to accept defeat.[VAR 0114(0035)]
All right, new kid, what do you want? Autograph?\nSelfie? PvP match on my stream?[VAR 0114(000F)]
Come on, don’t be shy—spit it out.[VAR 0114(000F)]
I’d like a promotion match
One autograph, please
I don’t need anything
What are you saying?! Ugh, just put me on\nspeaker...[VAR 0114(000B)]
Please, Canari, forget that just now! Would you\ngive my friend the honor of a promotion match?[VAR 0114(000B)]
A promotion match?![VAR 0114(000F)]
Seriously? I mean, what’s the point? I’m just\ngonna win anyway.[VAR 0114(000F)]
Is this kid really a fan? Ya’d think a fan’d prefer\nbein’ the same rank as Canari...[VAR 0114(000F)]
Hmmm...[VAR 0114(000F)]
Fine, whatever. If that’s what the Quiz Whiz\nwants, that’s what the Quiz Whiz gets.[VAR 0114(000F)]
As your reward, I accept your challenge! We’ll\nbattle it out at Racine Construction, cool?[VAR 0114(000F)]
Now that I’m in, you better get ready to be\ncrushed to bits like a Super Lumiose Galette![VAR 0114(000F)]
Bring your best Pokémon so you can’t make any\nexcuses when you lose![VAR 0114(000F)]
We finally landed ourselves a promotion match.\nNice work.[VAR 0114(000B)]
It’s all because of you
Thank you, Naveen
You have my thanks as well. After all, you helped\nme become the Quiz Whiz—even if it’s unofficial.[VAR 0114(000B)]
I’ll leave the rest to you.\c\nAfter all, fans really have no business getting any\ncloser to Canari than I have now.[VAR 0114(000B)]
When you’re ready to battle Canari, head to\nTarragon’s company, Racine Construction.[VAR 0114(000B)]
After our fierce competition, you and I are truly\ncomrades, joined by the bonds of battle![VAR 0114(0035)]
You’re getting far too close to Canari...\c\nHow deplorable.
I’m so glad I got to take part in the Canari Quiz\nWhiz Contest...
Congratulations, Quiz Whiz! Your amazing display\nout there really taught me a lot.
Thanks to you, this contest was unforgettable.\c\nI’ve always felt like I’m just sort of...existing, but\nnow I’m gonna try to live my life to the fullest!\r\n...Starting tomorrow.
My prediction is that Canari will win the\npromotion match! Yep, I’m sure of it.
I’m gonna win next time, and then I’ll ask Canari\nto play games with me!
With die-hard Canatics like you around, my hopes\nof winning the contest are slimmer than slim!
Now I wanna raise an Eelektross! I’ll start by\nsearching for a Tynamo.
You know what? I think I’m going to become\nMani’s fan.
I’ve got to hurry and exchange all my Colorful\nScrews for Canari plush!
After spending so much time watching Canari, I\nfeel totally charged up and ready for anything!
That battle in the final round was riveting!
[~ 925]
Funny how our paths keep crossin’, ain’t it?[VAR 0114(0010)]
I was watchin’ ya in the Quiz Whiz Contest, and I\ngotta say, ya did great out there, kid![VAR 0114(0010)]
You were watching?
What do you mean?
If ya can beat me in a battle, I’ll tell ya everythin’.\nSo, whaddya say?[VAR 0114(0010)]
I’ll battle you
I need a minute
Why’d ya even come here, then?[VAR 0114(0010)]
Let’s do this in the garage.[VAR 0114(0010)]
[~ 935]
Sorry, I can’t let anyone get in the way of my\ngrandkid’s gaming—not even the Quiz Whiz![VAR 0114(0010)]
Let’s get this Pokémon battle goin’![VAR 0114(0010)]
Hey, where ya goin’?! Ain’t ya gonna fight me?[VAR 0114(0010)]
[~ 939]
Excadrill, I need ya to Mega Evolve! Let’s show\nthis kid what we’re made of![VAR 0114(0010)]
[~ 941]
Ha! I expected nothin’ less from the rising star of\nthe Z-A Royale! Ya brought out the full potential\r\nof yer Pokémon![VAR 0114(0010)]
And it’s not just Pokémon battles—ya exceeded\nmy expectations in the Canari Quiz Whiz Contest,\r\ntoo. Clearly yer a dedicated fan of Canari![VAR 0114(0010)]
As a Trainer in the Z-A Royale, and as Canari’s\ngrandpa, it was a joy to get to battle ya.[VAR 0114(0010)]
Which is why I feel the need to tell ya a secret\nabout my precious grandkid, Canari.[VAR 0114(0010)]
What secret?

I’ve been usin’ the latest Holo Caster to project a\nhologram of Canari...[VAR 0114(0010)]

That’s right—the hologram of Canari ya saw at the\nCanari Quiz Whiz Contest...[VAR 0114(0010)]

My grandkid’s primary focus is her gamin’. Fan\ninteractions ain’t a priority for her.[VAR 0114(0010)]
But still, I want to show folks round the world\nhow cool, smart, and talented my grandkid is![VAR 0114(0010)]
That’s why I started pretendin’ to be Canari usin’\nthe Holo Caster![VAR 0114(0010)]

You’ve got spirit, that’s for sure! But let’s be real:\nI’d rather be streamin’ than battlin’ you.[VAR 0114(000F)]

Take this, too. Give it to the person who’s been\nhelpin’ you out.[VAR 0114(000F)]

It may have something to do with Mega Power—\nwhich we know very little about, other than the\r\nrole it plays in Rogue Mega Evolution.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Even regular Mega Evolution is still largely a\nmystery to us... It’s a bit dispiriting.[VAR 0114(000B)]

C’mon, Naveen.\c\nIf we’re gonna do this anyway, we ought to give\nthe hotel some good PR while we’re at it.[VAR 0114(000C)]

Yeah, it’s a surefire sales strategy!\c\n“Come one, come all! Get the finest view of Rogue\nMega Evolution—only at Hotel Z!”[VAR 0114(0005)]
I see... So we’d leave the Beedrill in its Rogue\nMega-Evolved state to use it as a draw?\c\nIt’s a bold plan, but I’m open to it. What do you\nsay, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Yep—it’s what’s best for Hotel Z
Let’s ask AZ for his take!
Thinking about it, I could probably design special\nmerch with Rogue Mega Beedrill as the motif.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Oooh, good call. We could even fill up a whole\nroom with Beedrill stuff![VAR 0114(0006)]

Second is stopping the Rogue Mega-Evolving\nHawlucha on a rooftop in Magenta Sector 3!\r\nI’ll take this one.[VAR 0114(000C)]

It’s called “Rogue Mega Evolution”...
It went berserk
There’s been a lot of talk about Pokémon going\ncrazy out of nowhere...\c\nHard to believe it was all true.
I’ve heard about this Rogue Mega Evolution thing.\nWhy’s it been happening to these wild Pokémon?
Nobody knows
We’re still investigating...
Still a mystery, huh?\c\nYou know, I wonder if it has something to do with\nall the wild Pokémon coming into Lumiose...\c\nAll this weirdness started around the same time\nas the renovation work on Prism Tower too.

Hmph. Quasartico wants Lumiose to be a “city\nfor both people and Pokémon,” but it isn’t as easy\r\nas all that, is it?
Still, I’ll be sad if that’s the last any of us sees of\nthat feisty Beedrill.\c\nI hope it comes back soon now that it’s calmed\ndown.

You think the Hawlucha that lady’s looking for is\nthe one that’s gonna Rogue Mega Evolve?[VAR 0114(000C)]
That seems likely
I think so, yeah
Oh man. I don’t wanna think about how she’d\nfeel if her dear Hawlucha went rogue...[VAR 0114(000C)]
It’s an update from Vinnie! Looks like they’re\ndetecting Hawlucha nearby! C’mon![VAR 0114(000C)]
[~ 175]
There’s the Hawlucha, just like Vinnie said![VAR 0114(000C)]
We’ve gotta help it—for everyone’s sake, but\nespecially for that lady back there![VAR 0114(000C)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Oh, here—let me heal [VAR 0102(0002)]\nup\r\nreal\r\nquick, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(000C)]
Let’s calm this Hawlucha down! I’ll give it all\nI’ve got![VAR 0114(000C)]
The concentration of Mega Power in your vicinity\nis rising rapidly!\c\nWarning: Rogue Mega Evolution is imminent!
I’m ready to handle it!
I need to prepare
[~ 183]
Some of these Pokémon that are Rogue Mega\nEvolving are really precious to people, huh...[VAR 0114(000C)]
I hope Hawlucha gets to see that lady again.[VAR 0114(000C)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]But anyway—great work calming it,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nLet me heal up [VAR 0102(0002)] and\neveryone.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Team MZ has got to keep on saving these poor\nPokémon from Rogue Mega Evolution, for sure![VAR 0114(000C)]
Rogue Mega-Evolved Pokémon successfully\npacified.\c\nThere are two remaining Pokémon at risk of\nundergoing Rogue Mega Evolution.

[~ 191]
There you are, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(000B)]
Something’s not quite right here.[VAR 0114(000B)]
We’re at the spot where the spike in Mega Power\nis apparently coming from...[VAR 0114(000B)]
But I haven’t been able to find the Banette\nwe’re after.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Perhaps we should ask Vinnie to check again...[VAR 0114(000B)]
Um, behind you...
You found it, all right
NYAAAH![VAR 0114(000B)]
*gasp* *wheeze*\nIt...it is indeed here, yes.[VAR 0114(000B)]
W-well. I suppose we’d better give all our\nPokémon the usual pre-battle healing.[VAR 0114(000B)]
I...I can do this. As a member of Team MZ, it’s my\nduty to help Rogue Pokémon. I just need to focus.[VAR 0114(000B)]
The concentration of Mega Power in your vicinity\nis rising rapidly!\c\nWarning: Rogue Mega Evolution is imminent!

[~ 206]
ZEHHHF!
So you continue to successfully save Pokémon\nfrom the pain of Rogue Mega Evolution.[VAR 0114(0019)]
Not that I wish to downplay the difficulty or scale\nof the undertaking.[VAR 0114(0019)]
After all, only with Mega-Evolved Pokémon or\nPlus Moves can you hope to stand up to\r\nRogue Mega-Evolved Pokémon effectively.[VAR 0114(0019)]
However...Zygarde cannot Mega Evolve.[VAR 0114(0019)]
That means you will need to hone your skills as a\nTrainer until you can support Zygarde, even with\r\nsuch a disadvantage.[VAR 0114(0019)]
This is how you must help Zygarde attain the\npeace and order it wishes to bring about.[VAR 0114(0019)]
I doubt that detective would be hunting me and\nZygarde if she knew its intentions. I wonder why\r\nshe finds me so suspicious.[VAR 0114(0019)]
In any case—until we meet again, young Trainers.\nI expect great things of you.[VAR 0114(0019)]
That man has quite the commanding presence...\nWhy is he dressed in those rags, I wonder?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Oh, I’m sorry—I got distracted and forgot to heal\nyour Pokémon.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Now, I’d better head back to the hotel to take care\nof some things...\c\nI’m not simply in a hurry to get away from this\ncreepy place, I assure you.[VAR 0114(000B)]

[~ 222]
So that’s another series of Rogue Mega Evolution\ncases all wrapped up, huh?[VAR 0114(0006)]
I guess that’s another mission on the books for\nus, right? Nice work, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0005)]
Let’s regroup at Hotel Z. Now that the urgent\nstuff is out of the way, I want to talk Z-A Royale.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Come back to Hotel Z for a bit. I want to talk to\neveryone about what we should do next.[VAR 0114(0005)]
[~ 227]
[VAR BD06(0000)]You’re really pulling your weight out there,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]. Thanks![VAR 0114(0006)]
You did great, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0005)]
We did kinda leave the heavy lifting to you again,\nhuh...[VAR 0114(000C)]
That’s just a natural consequence of someone\nproving themselves so thoroughly dependable.[VAR 0114(000B)]
True that—and the job sure is getting done. But\nI wonder...\c\nIs it really enough to just find and calm down\nPokémon after they Rogue Mega Evolve?[VAR 0114(0006)]
For sure—and the job is definitely getting done.\nBut I wonder...\c\nIs it really enough to just find and calm down\nPokémon after they Rogue Mega Evolve?[VAR 0114(0005)]
What do you mean?[VAR 0114(000C)]
I’d rather we get at the actual root of the problem.\c\nNot that we can do that until we know what’s\ncausing Rogue Mega Evolution in the first place...[VAR 0114(0006)]
I’d rather we get at the actual root of the problem.\c\nNot that we can do that until we know what’s\ncausing Rogue Mega Evolution in the first place...[VAR 0114(0005)]
I’m sure Quasartico is following whatever leads\nthey have.[VAR 0114(000B)]
If they were, you’d think Vinnie would at least\nkeep us in the loop...[VAR 0114(000C)]
The fact that he hasn’t told us anything probably\nmeans they don’t know for sure yet either.\c\nI bet they’d tell us anything they knew that could\ncome in handy, even if it didn’t directly relate to\r\nRogue Mega Evolution.[VAR 0114(0006)]
The fact that he hasn’t told us anything probably\nmeans they don’t know for sure yet either.\c\nI bet they’d tell us anything they knew that could\ncome in handy, even if it didn’t directly relate to\r\nRogue Mega Evolution.[VAR 0114(0005)]
This is a promotion match announcement for\nTrainer [VAR 0100(0000)] (Rank E).
The opponent for your next promotion match has\nbeen decided.
You are to face Trainer Ivor (Rank E).
The Trainer who wins will be promoted to [VAR FF00(0006)]Rank D[VAR FF00(0000)].
Oh, it’s that Ivor guy from the Fist of Justice!\c\nWe ran into him by that wild zone in Rouge\nPlaza, remember?[VAR 0114(0006)]
Oh, it’s Ivor from the Fist of Justice.\c\nRemember when we ran into him? I think it was\nby the wild zone in Rouge Plaza.[VAR 0114(0005)]
He runs a dojo that teaches karate or something.\nI bet he’s probably killer with Fighting types.[VAR 0114(0006)]
He runs a dojo that teaches karate or some other\nkinda martial arts.\c\nI bet you anything he’s a master Fighting-type\nuser.[VAR 0114(0005)]
I believe their dojo is near Jaune Plaza.[VAR 0114(000B)]
What a relief to know where they are and not\nhave to track ’em down like we did with Canari!\r\nThat was such a chore...[VAR 0114(000C)]
That “chore” was a small price to pay for the\nprivilege of meeting Canari!\c\nAnd I don’t recall there being any detective work.\nYou simply used the information I had.[VAR 0114(000B)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]So, [VAR 0100(0000)], do you have a\nChallenger’s\r\nTicket\r\nalready?[VAR 0114(0006)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]So, [VAR 0100(0000)], do you have a\nChallenger’s\r\nTicket\r\nalready?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Naturally
Not yet...
Why not go pay Ivor a quick visit, then?[VAR 0114(0006)]
Why don’t you go say hi to Ivor and get a look at\nhim before you two battle, then?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Sounds like it’s time to grind some more points\nin the Z-A Royale, then![VAR 0114(0006)]
Sounds like it’s time to earn some more points\nin the Z-A Royale, then![VAR 0114(0005)]
A promotion match right after battling a bunch of\nRogue Pokémon? That’s a lot. Be careful![VAR 0114(000C)]
I know Ivor’s huge, but don’t let that intimidate\nyou! It’s a Pokémon battle, not karate![VAR 0114(0006)]
Ivor might be gigantic, but don’t let that put you\noff. Your Pokémon will do the battling![VAR 0114(0005)]
Ivor is a giant of a guy, for real.[VAR 0114(000C)]
I’m intrigued by the karate gi the Fist of Justice\nmembers wear. What material do they use?[VAR 0114(000B)]
I must admit that watching you all engage with\neach other so closely leaves me rather envious.[VAR 0114(000A)]
[~ 266]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Hey, I remember you! [VAR 0100(0000)],\nright?\c\nYou beat me in battle right in front of Ivor-sensei\nthat one time! What do you want now?![VAR 0114(0033)]
I came to duke it out with Ivor
I’m here for a promotion match
What?! You were just Rank Y when we battled!\nYou mean you’ve already reached Sensei’s level?[VAR 0114(0033)]
Well, I’m sure you’ll understand that I have to ask:\nYou DID earn a Challenger’s Ticket, right?[VAR 0114(0033)]
If you don’t have a Challenger’s Ticket, then\nyou’re in no position to challenge Ivor-sensei.\r\nProve yourself in the Z-A Royale first![VAR 0114(0033)]
...Of course you did.[VAR 0114(0033)]
So that means your battle skills should be on par\nwith Ivor-sensei’s.[VAR 0114(0033)]
In which case![VAR 0114(0033)]
I request a bout! Both as my chance to get back\nat you for beating me last time, and to see how\r\nmuch stronger I’ve grown since that day![VAR 0114(0033)]
Sure, we can battle
Nah, I think I’m good
Hey! Seriously? But you HAVE to give me a\nchance to get even...[VAR 0114(0033)]
Thank you! I’m going to become the fourth-\nstrongest disciple in the dojo, for sure![VAR 0114(0033)]
[~ 281]
You might have me back on the ropes, but I’ll\nprove that the Fist of Justice never flinches![VAR 0114(0033)]
[~ 283]
You’re back—does that mean you have a\nChallenger’s Ticket now?[VAR 0114(0033)]
No? Then what are you here for?\c\nI told you that you needed to earn a Challenger’s\nTicket to face Ivor-sensei!\c\nSo go win more battles in the Z-A Royale if that’s\nstill what you want![VAR 0114(0033)]
Oh, you do... Figures, I guess, since you bothered\ncoming back.[VAR 0114(0033)]
[~ 287]
You’re just too strong![VAR 0114(0033)]
Does Team MZ have their own dojo with even\nharsher training than ours, or what?[VAR 0114(0033)]
I have to admit that you’ve really mastered your\nskills. Here—this Seed of Mastery is for you.[VAR 0114(0033)]
If you bring me seeds just like that one, I’ll help\nyour Pokémon turn their moves into Plus Moves![VAR 0114(0033)]
But, um...I have to admit...\c\nI’ve been taking up your time battling and talking\nabout Plus Moves and all, but the truth is that\r\nIvor-sensei isn’t even here at the dojo today.[VAR 0114(0033)]
Neither is his sister, Gwynn. It’s actually pretty\nunheard of for both of them to be gone...[VAR 0114(0033)]
Gwyyyyyynnnn!!![VAR 0114(0011)]
Gwyyyyyynnnn!!![VAR 0114(0011)]
Where are yooouuu?![VAR 0114(0011)]
So she’s not here either, then?[VAR 0114(0011)]
That’s right, Sensei. I haven’t seen her today.[VAR 0114(0033)]
Oh? You’re the Trainer who defeated Josée\noutside Wild Zone 3, no?[VAR 0114(0011)]
Wait, don’t tell me! You’re here to join the Fist of\nJustice, aren’t you?[VAR 0114(0011)]
Absolutely not
I’m here to battle you
[VAR 1100(00FF,0201)]HShe’s your opponent for your next promotion\nmatch, sir.[VAR 0114(0033)]
Ah, I see.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Well, I don’t have a Rotom Phone, so I’m afraid\nI cannot verify any of that right now.[VAR 0114(0011)]
You don’t...have a phone?
What about the Z-A app?
I’ve tried using Rotom Phones in the past...[VAR 0114(0011)]
But for some reason they always break as soon as\nI so much as press a finger to them.[VAR 0114(0011)]
So I rely on my younger sister, Gwynn, to handle\neverything smartphone related.[VAR 0114(0011)]
But I haven’t seen Gwynn since yesterday![VAR 0114(0011)]
My apologies, [VAR 0100(0000)]...\c\nI’m just so worried about my poor sister, I can’t\nthink of anything else.[VAR 0114(0011)]
I’m heading out again to search for her.[VAR 0114(0011)]
I’d be honored if you would face me in battle...\nafter my sister and I are reunited![VAR 0114(0011)]
Now, if you’ll excuse me![VAR 0114(0011)]
And he’s off again...[VAR 0114(0033)]
Sensei has stamina in spades, but I don’t think\nhe’ll have much luck finding Gwynn on his own\r\nin a huge city like this.\c\nMaybe there’s someone he plans to ask for help,\nthough... Someone who’s good at finding people?\r\nKnow anybody like that in Lumiose?[VAR 0114(0033)]
A detective, maybe?
You mean Emma?
That sounds right![VAR 0114(0033)]
I think you should help Sensei find his sister.\c\nOnce he knows where she is, he’ll be able to\nfocus on your promotion match.[VAR 0114(0033)]
[~ 322]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Hello there, [VAR 0100(0000)]. What\nbrings\r\nyou\r\nhere?[VAR 0114(0008)]
Well met once again, [VAR 0100(0000)].\c\nAs I mentioned before, I’m searching for my\nsister, Gwynn...[VAR 0114(0011)]
But this detective says she cannot help me.[VAR 0114(0011)]
No, what I said was that I can’t help you without\nmore to go on than “she’s missing.”[VAR 0114(0008)]
I’m happy to help look for your sister, but I need\nyou to answer my questions.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Ah, I understand.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Ask me anything! I’ll answer to the best of my\nability![VAR 0114(0011)]
Where does your sister like to go when she’s not\nat home or the dojo?[VAR 0114(0008)]
That would be city hall.[VAR 0114(0011)]
City hall? ...I see. Your sister certainly has, er,\nunique interests, doesn’t she?[VAR 0114(0008)]
Well then, maybe we can find some clues as to\nyour sister’s whereabouts if we go there.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Understood! I’m on it![VAR 0114(0011)]
He just...left?[VAR 0114(0008)]
If Mimi was feeling better, it could search for his\nsister using its telepathy. Oh well...[VAR 0114(0008)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]I could use your help, [VAR 0100(0000)].\nWe’ll\r\nbe\r\nwaiting\r\nfor\r\nyou\r\nin\r\nthe\r\nJaune District.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Let’s work together to protect the peace of\nLumiose![VAR 0114(0008)]
Murrrmurrr-mrrrawwwr...
[~ 340]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Emma, [VAR 0100(0000)]... I looked\nall\r\nover,\r\nbut\r\nGwynn’s\r\nnot\r\nhere\r\neither![VAR 0114(0011)]
That’s to be expected, Ivor. For now, let’s canvass\nthe area and gather information about Gwynn.[VAR 0114(0008)]
[VAR BD06(0000)][VAR 0100(0000)], I’d appreciate your\nhelp\r\nwith\r\ninterviewing\r\npeople\r\naround\r\ncity hall.[VAR 0114(0008)]
How’re the interviews going so far? Have you\nlearned anything new?[VAR 0114(0008)]
Gwynn... Where in the world could you be?[VAR 0114(0011)]
I climbed this ladder to see if I could spot Gwynn\nfrom above, but no such luck...[VAR 0114(0011)]
Gwynn from the Fist of Justice... Oh, you mean\nthat girl who’s always here?\c\nYeah, she gets called in to deal with all the\ncomplaints lodged by folks near their dojo about\r\nhow loud their training sessions are.
Poor Gwynn, having to sort things\nout for her brother like that...
I hear she often heads to a café off Centrico Plaza\nwith a friend after she’s done here at city hall.
Find any leads, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0008)]
Gwynn might be near Centrico Plaza
We should check that café food truck
That matches what I heard, too. It sounds like she\nleft for Centrico Plaza with someone.[VAR 0114(0008)]
For our next move, I suggest we investigate the\nfood truck at that location.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Understood! I’m on it![VAR 0114(0011)]
I know he’s worried about his sister, but must he\ngo rushing off like that each time?[VAR 0114(0008)]
I suppose that’s how it is with family. Anyway, we\nshould hurry after him.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Does the Fist of Justice really need to keep up\nwith training twenty-four seven?
Now that there are more wild Pokémon around,\nit’s a lot of work to clean up all their droppings!
That incident five years ago caused property\nvalues all over Lumiose to completely tank.\c\nThat’s why we now have that whole urban\nredevelopment plan.
Someone’s gone missing? [VAR BD0A(000A)]Text_icon1
You got yourself a missing person, eh? Well, I\ndon’t know anything about that. Good luck!
Found her! [VAR BD0A(000A)]Text_icon1
I managed to find an old friend of mine online!
Where is she...? [VAR BD0A(000A)]Text_icon1
You haven’t seen my sweet Furfrou around here,\nhave you?
That girl... [VAR BD0A(000A)]Text_icon1
That girl at the café had such a cute bag! I\nshould have asked her where she got it.
Justice... [VAR BD0A(000A)]Text_icon1
My rival at work finally got the dressing-down he\ndeserved. Sweet, sweet justice...
Ivor... [VAR BD0A(000A)]Text_icon1
Ivor’s iconic. I mean, look at those muscles!
I can help! [VAR BD0A(000A)]Text_icon1
I know lots of useful things! Like, um, it’s not\nnice to throw a tantrum when you lose a battle!
Oh gosh, it’s\njust awful! [VAR BD0A(000A)]Text_icon1
No paid vacation AND we’re getting our pay cut?!\nThis is ridiculous!
What was it?\nWyn...? Gwyn...? [VAR BD0A(000A)]Text_icon1
Wyndon! That was it! Hoo, I was just blanking on\nthe name of that city in Galar for a while there.
The Fist of Justice, huh? [VAR BD0A(000A)]Text_icon1
[~ 380]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Emma, [VAR 0100(0000)]... There’s no\nsign\r\nof\r\nGwynn\r\nhere,\r\neither![VAR 0114(0011)]
Again, we need to ask around to learn more![VAR 0114(0008)]
Well, if it isn’t our local detective. The usual Fire\nBlast Roast for you today?
I’m in the mood for something else. I’ll take one\nFlamethrower Roast...[VAR 0114(0008)]
and any information you have on a certain\nmissing girl, to go.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Oooh, am I getting questioned here? I’ll spill.\nHelping out with an investigation seems fun.
Her? Yeah, I’ve seen her. She came by earlier with\nthat DYN4MO girl.
[VAR BD06(0000)]Any idea who that could be,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0008)]
Possibly Canari?
Maybe Tarragon?
I said “girl,” genius. ’Course it was Canari.
Those two seem like polar opposites, but perhaps\nopposites attract, as they say.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Ivor, do you know if your sister is close to Canari\nfrom DYN4MO?[VAR 0114(0008)]
The name isn’t ringing any bells... Where can I go\nto meet this Canari?[VAR 0114(0011)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]You just had a promotion match against Canari,\ndidn’t you, [VAR 0100(0000)]? Where\r\nwas it?[VAR 0114(0008)]
We could visit Racine Construction
I’d check the electrical substation
Ivor, hold up![VAR 0114(0008)]
Are you sure Canari’s at the electrical substation?[VAR 0114(0008)]
Racine Construction, eh? I’m on it![VAR 0114(0011)]
There he goes again...[VAR 0114(0008)]
I’ll be back later to grab that coffee![VAR 0114(0008)]
What?! But we already got it started!
We should hurry to Racine Construction, too.\nCome on, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0008)]
We certainly hope to see you again soon...
[~ 406]
Where’s Gwynn?[VAR 0114(0011)]
Not here, obviously![VAR 0114(000F)]
It would seem there’s no sign of Gwynn here,\neither...[VAR 0114(0011)]
Hey! What’s the big idea?! Don’t just go around\ntellin’ randos where to find me.[VAR 0114(000F)]
This massive meathead barged in out of nowhere\nyellin’ “Where’s Gwynn?!” so loud I nearly had a\r\nheart attack on stream![VAR 0114(000F)]
He’s lucky Pops ain’t here, or there would’ve been\nan all-out brawl.[VAR 0114(000F)]
Sorry, Canari. We promise we won’t reveal your\nlocation to anyone else, but we need your help.[VAR 0114(0008)]
We’re looking for someone named Gwynn. This\ngentleman is her older brother.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Thanks, Detective Obvious, but like I said, G-Volt\nain’t here.[VAR 0114(000F)]
Still, I love a quiz, so tell you what—try guessing.\nIf you’re close, maybe I’ll tell you what I know.[VAR 0114(000F)]
Please! You simply must tell me where she is.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Back off, big guy! You’re creepin’ me out. Ever\nheard of personal space?[VAR 0114(000F)]
I hope you’ll take my refusal to back down as\nproof of how worried I am about Gwynn.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Mute it, musclebag! If you’re sooo worried, then\ntry payin’ more attention to what she gets up to![VAR 0114(000F)]
Oh, right![VAR 0114(000F)]
[VAR BD06(0000)][VAR 0100(0000)]! I almost forgot you\nwere here.[VAR 0114(000F)]
If you’ve finally decided to join the Canatic crew,\nI guess I could give you a hint...[VAR 0114(000F)]
But not until I get my revenge for our last battle!\nHow else am I gonna heal my wounded ego?[VAR 0114(000F)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]In that case, why not have a rematch now? If\n[VAR 0100(0000)] wins, you tell us\r\nwhere\r\nwe\r\nshould\r\nlook\r\nfor\r\nGwynn.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Not sure how a fancy detective got caught up in\nthis family fetch quest, but I’m in and I’ll win![VAR 0114(000F)]
Just to warn you, I’ve upped my game since last\ntime. You ready to lose?[VAR 0114(000F)]
I’ll win again!
Just a minute
Seriously? Ugh...[VAR 0114(000F)]
Bring it on! No mercy this time—I’m goin’ in for\nthe overkill![VAR 0114(000F)]
[~ 432]
Enough playin’ around! Eelektross, let’s crank up\nthe voltage with Mega Evolution![VAR 0114(000F)]
[~ 434]
&%^@#?&!★#$![VAR 0114(000F)]
!%★@^$*&=§#!!![VAR 0114(000F)]
*pant pant*[VAR 0114(000F)]
Yeesh, what’s with you? You’re not supposed to\nget stronger than me...[VAR 0114(000F)]
Whatever. You wanna know about G-Volt, yeah?[VAR 0114(000F)]
She’s been a Canatic since way back, so we’re\npretty close. Sometimes we hang out and play\r\ngames together and stuff.[VAR 0114(000F)]
In one game sesh, she mentioned how she’s\nlookin’ for some spot that could be all hers.\r\nA “place that can’t be found in the world.”[VAR 0114(000F)]
What? That doesn’t make sense.[VAR 0114(0008)]
All I know is what I heard: that G-Volt wanted to\ngo where the X, Y, and Z axes don’t meet up...\r\nwhatever that means.[VAR 0114(000F)]
And she was goin’ on about needin’ to beat a\nPokémon whose type her partner is weak to.[VAR 0114(000F)]
Last I heard, she was headed to some fountain\ndepictin’ a Pokémon like that, so she could at\r\nleast imagine how she’d beat it in her head.[VAR 0114(000F)]
A fountain! Now we’re getting somewhere.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Ivor, do you know which Pokémon your sister has\nas her partner?[VAR 0114(0008)]
Of course! That would be Chandelure, the Luring\nPokémon. Its types are Ghost and Fire![VAR 0114(0011)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]That fountain seems like a pretty important clue,\n[VAR 0100(0000)].\c\nWhich fountain depicts a Pokémon that Gwynn’s\nChandelure would struggle with, I wonder?[VAR 0114(0008)]
The Florges fountain
The Clawitzer fountain
The Heatmor fountain
The Floette fountain
Hm... Florges is a Fairy type, which shouldn’t\nusually be an issue for Chandelure.[VAR 0114(0008)]
The Heatmor fountain? There isn’t a fountain like\nthat in Lumiose. If there was, I bet it’d be famous.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Hm... Floette is a Fairy type, which shouldn’t\nusually be an issue for Chandelure.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Yes! Clawitzer is a Water-type Pokémon, isn’t it?\c\nAnd Chandelure is a Fire type, which makes it\nweak to Water-type moves.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Great! So we should look for a Clawitzer, yes?[VAR 0114(0011)]
I’m on it![VAR 0114(0011)]
Has anyone stopped to think that G-Volt might\njust want some alone time?[VAR 0114(000F)]
I’d probably need space if I had to deal with a\nbrother like Ivor. A LOT of space.[VAR 0114(000F)]
Knowin’ that dimwit, he’s probably headed to a\nwild zone now to look for an actual Clawitzer.[VAR 0114(000F)]
Don’t worry—it’s my duty to protect the peace in\nLumiose, and that’s exactly what I plan to do![VAR 0114(0008)]
Come on, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nLet’s hurry over to the Clawitzer fountain in\nBleu Sector 7![VAR 0114(0008)]
Ivor, wait! It’s the Clawitzer FOUNTAIN![VAR 0114(0008)]
[~ 466]
Emma! [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nI only see a fountain here. There’s no sign of\nGwynn anywhere![VAR 0114(0011)]
So you don’t have any idea where Gwynn might\nbe in this area, then...[VAR 0114(0008)]
But this must be the right place—there’s the\nClawitzer fountain, just like Canari told us.[VAR 0114(0008)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Well, [VAR 0100(0000)]? Do you think\nwe’ll\r\nfind\r\nGwynn\r\nsomewhere\r\naround here?[VAR 0114(0008)]
I’m sure of it
I don’t know
Me too.[VAR 0114(0008)]
We don’t have any other leads to go on. Through\nprocess of elimination, this should be the place.[VAR 0114(0008)]
You’re unsure?[VAR 0114(0008)]
We don’t have any other leads to go on. Through\nprocess of elimination, this should be the place.[VAR 0114(0008)]
But if so, where could Gwynn be hiding? This\nplace is just an empty square...[VAR 0114(0008)]
Do we have any other clues?
What else did Canari tell us?
Let’s see, there was something about a place\nwhere the X, Y, and Z axes didn’t meet...[VAR 0114(0008)]
Yes, of course! The X axis is horizontal, the Y axis\nis vertical, and the Z axis is depth...[VAR 0114(0008)]
Which means we’re likely starting from the right\nplace! I’m guessing our X axis is correct.\c\nNext, we need to adjust our Y axis. Once we do\nthat, we’ll be on the right track to find Gwynn![VAR 0114(0008)]
You mean we should go down? Into the sewers?\nBut there’s all this water in the way.[VAR 0114(0011)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]What would your approach be,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0008)]
I’d vaporize the water
I’d drink all the water
I’d stop the water
Vaporize the water, huh? I suppose a Legendary\nPokémon might have a Fire-type move hot enough\r\nto do that...[VAR 0114(0008)]
I don’t think anything could vaporize this much\nwater. Even after extensive training.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Drink it? ALL of it?! No, I wouldn’t suggest that...[VAR 0114(0008)]
So don’t you even think about it, Ivor![VAR 0114(0008)]
Well, I’ve trained my body to accomplish feats\nsuch as this. With some effort, I imagine I could—[VAR 0114(0011)]
I said NO! You’ll make yourself sick doing that.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Stop the water? That sounds like a tall order.[VAR 0114(0008)]
The skills I’ve honed in the Fist of Justice can\nsurely help us solve this problem...[VAR 0114(0011)]
Aha! I have it! I’ll just smash the fountain![VAR 0114(0011)]
That would cause the water to shoot upward, yes?\nThen the water pooling below will drain away![VAR 0114(0011)]
Yes, a perfect solution! Go, Falinks! Use—[VAR 0114(0011)]
STOP RIGHT THERE![VAR 0114(0008)]
You can’t just destroy city property![VAR 0114(0008)]
Honestly. I can see why people complain about\nthe Fist of Justice taking things too far...[VAR 0114(0008)]
But you might be onto something, Ivor. Maybe\nwe can stop the water from flowing somehow.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Then I shall use my martial arts after all, and—[VAR 0114(0011)]
[VAR 0100(0000)]! I have an idea.\c\nFind a Pokémon that knows Ice Beam and bring\nit back here.[VAR 0114(0008)]
If we freeze the fountain’s nozzles to stop the\nflow, the water that’s filling the pool below ought\r\nto empty into the sewer. Then we can investigate![VAR 0114(0008)]
[~ 506]
Find a Pokémon that can use Ice Beam and add it\nto your party.\c\nThe Vanillite in Wild Zone 12 should know that\nmove, I think.[VAR 0114(0008)]
If only I could smash water with my bare fists...\nMy training has clearly not been diligent enough.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Looks like you brought a Pokémon that can use\nIce Beam. Well done![VAR 0114(0008)]
Now then, freeze the water in that fountain![VAR 0114(0008)]
Wow, Blizzard? Seems a little excessive to use a\nmove with a power of 110, but it got the job done.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Marvelously done, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0011)]
Look! All the water’s draining through the sewers![VAR 0114(0011)]
As long as the fountain stays frozen, we won’t\nneed to worry about getting flooded.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Quick, then! Let’s search the sewers![VAR 0114(0011)]
I shall go on ahead![VAR 0114(0011)]
Ivor certainly doesn’t waste time once he knows\nwhere he’s going, does he?[VAR 0114(0008)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]We should head in too,\n[VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0008)]
Are you sure that move’s gonna freeze the water\nin the fountain?[VAR 0114(0008)]
You used Freeze-Dry?! You didn’t need to freeze it\nso quickly, you know.[VAR 0114(0008)]
[~ 521]
These sewers were built a very long time ago.[VAR 0114(0008)]
There are wild Pokémon about, so be on your\nguard. Who knows how they get in here...[VAR 0114(0008)]
Wild Pokémon, you say? But...will Gwynn be safe\ndown here, then?[VAR 0114(0011)]
That’s why we’re trying to find her![VAR 0114(0008)]
Understood! I’m on it![VAR 0114(0011)]
There he goes again.[VAR 0114(0008)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Come on, we should help him look for Gwynn,\n[VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0008)]
Watch out for wild Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0008)]
[~ 530]
There you are, [VAR 0100(0000)].\c\nIt looks like this lock is preventing us from going\nfarther in.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Then let us power through with pure strength![VAR 0114(0011)]
Shall I smash through this barrier so we may\nproceed?[VAR 0114(0011)]
No! Destroying! Public! Property![VAR 0114(0008)]
[VAR BD06(0000)][VAR 0100(0000)], let’s take a closer\nlook\r\nand\r\nsee\r\nif\r\nwe\r\ncan’t\r\nfigure\r\nthis\r\nout.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Which area do you want to check?[VAR 0114(0008)]
The keyhole
The lock body
The hinges
Check for gaps
It’s shaped like a typical keyhole. Nothing out of\nthe ordinary here.
It looks like a regular lock made from some sort of\nmetal alloy.
You don’t notice anything unusual about the\ndoor’s hinges.
There’s only a tiny gap between the door and the\nfloor.
Detective work is awfully dull.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Found anything interesting yet?[VAR 0114(0008)]
So there’s no clever way to open this door, then?\nI guess we’ll just have to find the key...[VAR 0114(0008)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Where do you think the key could be,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0008)]
Maybe it’s hidden somewhere?
Maybe a Pokémon has it?
We need more information
Hmm, you might be right. There’s not much to go\non, is there?\c\nAs it stands, we can’t even make an educated\nguess...[VAR 0114(0008)]
Well, that Pokémon had some keys.[VAR 0114(0011)]
That was a Klefki, right? Let’s go after it![VAR 0114(0008)]
[~ 555]
Klef.
It seems possible that one of Klefki’s keys could\nhelp us open up that lock back there...[VAR 0114(0008)]
Then I shall go ahead and catch it![VAR 0114(0011)]
The Poké Balls I throw reach speeds of over 100\nmiles per hour.[VAR 0114(0011)]
This does, unfortunately, mean there is a chance\nof Klefki being knocked out as it’s caught, but\r\nthat’s just a risk we’ll have to take.[VAR 0114(0011)]
STOP RIGHT THERE![VAR 0114(0008)]
That’s hardly different than punching the poor\nthing! We’re not in ancient Hisui, you know![VAR 0114(0008)]
This also raises some concerns about how you\nmanaged to catch your own Pokémon, Ivor...[VAR 0114(0008)]
Anyway, I think we can safely leave this matter to\n[VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0008)]
Here—feel free to use these Ultra Balls.[VAR 0114(0008)]
All right, now catch that Klefki![VAR 0114(0008)]
[~ 567]
You need to open up space in your Boxes before\nyou catch Klefki!
Don’t forget—we don’t want to just knock it out.\nWe want to catch that Klefki![VAR 0114(0008)]
Kle!
Let’s catch that Klefki and see if it’ll lend us a key\nfor that lock.[VAR 0114(0008)]
That Klefki must be the keeper of the keys![VAR 0114(0011)]
[~ 573]
Klef!
Wait, you defeated it?! We need to catch it and\nborrow its keys![VAR 0114(0008)]
[~ 576]
Let’s try that again. We need to catch that Klefki\nto see if we can borrow a key for that lock.[VAR 0114(0008)]
[~ 578]
Nice catch![VAR 0114(0008)]
I feel I have witnessed the very essence of a\nmasterful capture.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Th-that’s a bit excessive, no? I mean, we all catch\nPokémon like that...right?[VAR 0114(0008)]
Anyway, let’s see if Klefki can get that lock open\nfor us![VAR 0114(0008)]
[~ 583]
We’re counting on you, Klefki![VAR 0114(0011)]
... ... ...
It doesn’t seem to have the key for this lock...
Huh. I really thought that was going to be the\ntrick to getting through here...[VAR 0114(0008)]
How about this, then, Madam Detective.[VAR 0114(0011)]
If we are truly stuck, perhaps we might try out\nmy plan?[VAR 0114(0011)]
First off, thanks for calling me “Madam Detective.”\nJust “Detective” or “Emma” works, too.\c\nNow what was your plan, Ivor?[VAR 0114(0008)]
If there is no gimmick or mechanism to open this\nlock, then it must be opened by a key!\c\nBut there is no guarantee that said key can even\nbe found in these sewers.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Since we cannot obtain the key we need, we must\nlet my honed fist BECOME the key![VAR 0114(0011)]
Our path will be opened, thanks to my power![VAR 0114(0011)]
JUSTICE PUUUNCH![VAR 0114(0011)]
Fiii...
With that, our way is clear. Let’s press on![VAR 0114(0011)]
So that’s what he calls a “plan”... Personally, I’d\ncall it “brute force.”[VAR 0114(0008)]
In any case, we should hurry after him.[VAR 0114(0008)]
[~ 599]
Did you both see that? It was Chandelure—the\nLuring Pokémon...[VAR 0114(0008)]
It may be the very same Chandelure that Gwynn\nhas as her partner![VAR 0114(0011)]
[~ 602]
It looks like a dead end. No doors or anything.[VAR 0114(0008)]
And no sign of that Chandelure, either.[VAR 0114(0011)]
It’s a Ghost-type Pokémon, so it’s not surprising\nthat it can vanish at will.[VAR 0114(0008)]
If it is indeed Gwynn’s partner, then maybe it\nvanished to wherever Gwynn is?[VAR 0114(0011)]
A keen observation. Given the situation, I’d say\nthat’s highly likely.[VAR 0114(0008)]
All right, let’s search every last inch of this room,\n[VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0008)]
I have learned something important in the course\nof this investigation...\c\nIf I go around smashing things in the name of\ndetective work, Emma gets very cross indeed.[VAR 0114(0011)]
[~ 610]
A cluster of pipes and some valves... Nothing\nspecial about them.
You don’t know what these four machines are for,\nbut they don’t seem related to the case.
Some old electric panels. You tried flipping a few\nswitches, but nothing happened.
You took a good look at the pale-colored crates,\nbut they don’t seem to be anything special.
You’ve already inspected this area. Better check\nsomewhere else.
[~ 616]
We’ve checked all over this room, but there’s no\nsign of any hidden contraptions.[VAR 0114(0008)]
In that case, the only course of action is to act![VAR 0114(0011)]
Strength is power! Strength is justice![VAR 0114(0011)]
JUSTICE PUUUNCH![VAR 0114(0011)]
Hm? That’s odd...[VAR 0114(0011)]
I have smashed countless walls in my life...\c\nThis is the first time I’ve punched a wall and had\nmy fist go straight through without breaking it.\r\nIt felt like my hand went inside the wall itself![VAR 0114(0011)]
Could it be...?[VAR 0114(0008)]
The wall wasn’t real in the first place![VAR 0114(0008)]
So someone—or something—conjured up that\nillusion of a wall to fool us.[VAR 0114(0008)]
The chill I felt when passing through it makes me\nthink this could be the work of a Ghost type.[VAR 0114(0008)]
So you’re saying that a Ghost-type Pokémon is\nattempting to deceive us?[VAR 0114(0011)]
I think so, though we can’t prove it yet.[VAR 0114(0008)]
I see...\c\nClearly I must undergo even more diligent training\nif I wish to smash illusory walls.[VAR 0114(0011)]
But for now, let us proceed! I am sure Gwynn is\nwaiting for us on the other side.[VAR 0114(0011)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Let’s keep pushing ahead,\n[VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0008)]
[~ 632]
[VAR 0100(0000)]. Look there.[VAR 0114(0008)]
I need to be able to smash walls of any kind...[VAR 0114(0011)]
Then I can finally tear down the barriers that\nseparate the people and Pokémon of Lumiose!\c\nYes! The wild zones will separate us no more, and\neveryone will be the happier for it![VAR 0114(0011)]
[~ 636]
I do believe that Chandelure must be Gwynn’s\npartner.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Wait, Chandelure! Please help us find Gwynn![VAR 0114(0011)]
Hmmm, her partner Pokémon is freely roaming\naround and doesn’t seem particularly agitated...\c\nI suppose we can assume that even if someone is\nbehind Gwynn’s disappearance, the culprit isn’t\r\nmonitoring the area or anything.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Every step we take brings us closer to the truth.\nLet’s hurry, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0008)]
There’s no mistaking it. That was Gwynn’s\nChandelure![VAR 0114(0011)]
If that Pokémon really is Gwynn’s trusted partner,\nis there someone else behind her disappearance?[VAR 0114(0008)]
[~ 643]
Gwynn![VAR 0114(0011)]
...?[VAR 0114(0012)]
We’ve found our missing person![VAR 0114(0008)]
Where’s the villain who trapped you down here?[VAR 0114(0011)]
Let’s think back over everything we’ve seen so far.\nCan you identify the culprit behind all this?[VAR 0114(0008)]
Ivor
Gwynn
Chandelure
There is no culprit
I think Gwynn would have reacted differently to\nseeing her brother just now if it were him.[VAR 0114(0008)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Excellent deduction, [VAR 0100(0000)].\nThough\r\nI\r\nsuppose\r\n“culprit”\r\nmay\r\nbe\r\na\r\nbit strong.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Chandelure...? Do you think a Pokémon would\nreally abduct its own Trainer?[VAR 0114(0008)]
That’s right, in a way. There is no culprit because\nno crime has been committed.[VAR 0114(0008)]
What are you saying, Madam Detective?\c\nGwynn was trapped here—we saw it with our\nown eyes![VAR 0114(0011)]
The supposed victim here is Gwynn. However, she\ncame here of her own volition.[VAR 0114(0008)]
That’s the truth behind this whole case.[VAR 0114(0008)]
The truth...? If you really wish to hear it, then\ndefeat me in battle.[VAR 0114(0012)]
I’m a Pokémon Trainer too, after all.[VAR 0114(0012)]
Here, I’ll heal up your Pokémon and leave the rest\nto you, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0008)]
Good luck![VAR 0114(0008)]
Frankly, I have no idea what’s going on.[VAR 0114(0011)]
[~ 665]
Are we doing this?[VAR 0114(0012)]
Let’s battle!
I’d rather not
If you won’t battle, I want you all to leave...[VAR 0114(0012)]
I’m going to win...so you’ll all leave me in peace![VAR 0114(0012)]
Strength is power! Strength is justice![VAR 0114(0012)]
[~ 672]
Chandelure... Mega Evolve. Finish them.[VAR 0114(0012)]
[~ 674]
My justice wasn’t wrong... I simply lacked power.[VAR 0114(0012)]
Well fought, in any case. And well deduced, both\nof you.[VAR 0114(0012)]
Do you know these two, Gwynn?[VAR 0114(0011)]
Of course. Emma is the greatest detective in all of\nLumiose...[VAR 0114(0012)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]And [VAR 0100(0000)] is a member of\nTeam MZ.[VAR 0114(0012)]
[VAR 1100(00FF,0201)]HShe’s also the reigning Canari Quiz Whiz.[VAR 0114(0012)]
I see... And what did you mean when you said\n“well deduced”?[VAR 0114(0011)]
Where to start...\c\nYou break every smartphone you touch, Ivor.\c\nAnd once you start battling in the Z-A Royale, you\ndon’t stop, even when dawn comes.[VAR 0114(0012)]
Your excessive training will keep going on and on\nas you climb the ranks of the Royale.[VAR 0114(0012)]
Meanwhile, I am the one who deals with all the\ncomplaints about your behavior.\c\nIt is an enormous burden.[VAR 0114(0012)]
So I asked Chandelure and one of the Klefki to\nhelp me hide down here.\c\nThat way, you would be unable to participate in\nany promotion matches.[VAR 0114(0012)]
But then you had to come and find me...[VAR 0114(0012)]
I had no idea I was causing the Fist of Justice and\nmy own sister so much trouble...[VAR 0114(0011)]
Well, you were.[VAR 0114(0012)]
So I would love to see you give my brother a good\nthrashing, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0012)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]It’s true, then? [VAR 0100(0000)] is my\nopponent\r\nfor\r\nmy\r\nnext\r\npromotion match?[VAR 0114(0011)]
See for yourself.[VAR 0114(0012)]
There it is, plain as day![VAR 0114(0011)]
Well, it seems I must prepare for our bout! I hope\nyou will all excuse me...[VAR 0114(0011)]
Honestly...[VAR 0114(0012)]
I’m obligated to look into any case I take on, but\nperhaps I should have let this one go cold...[VAR 0114(0008)]
Still, I’m surprised you knew of a hiding place like\nthis. It’s almost undetectable, with all the barriers\r\nand tricks the Pokémon helped put up.[VAR 0114(0008)]
I found this place when I was very young.\c\nIt was here that I met Chandelure, though it was\nonly a Litwick back then.[VAR 0114(0012)]
The Ghost-type Pokémon let me come and go as\nI please, so I visit on occasion.\c\nI love the quiet down here...and the dark.[VAR 0114(0012)]
Well, now that Ivor knows about this place, I\nsuppose you’ll need to find a new hiding spot.[VAR 0114(0008)]
We should head back for now.\c\nThis may be your favorite spot, but it’s not exactly\nfit for...long-term residence, let’s say.[VAR 0114(0008)]
...Of course.[VAR 0114(0012)]
[~ 702]
Maybe I should train up a bit. A little extra muscle\ncould come in handy during my investigations.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Extra muscle? Please, not another Ivor.[VAR 0114(0012)]
I was joking.\c\nMy Expansion Suit can help me out in a pinch,\nthough I decided not to use it unless necessary.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Oh, and Gwynn, tell Ivor I’ll be sending him a bill\nfor my help, OK?[VAR 0114(0008)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Good luck with your promotion match,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0008)]
When you’re ready to face Ivor, come to the\nJustice Dojo.[VAR 0114(0012)]
[~ 709]
At last you’ve arrived![VAR 0114(0011)]
Gwynn has made her feelings on the matter clear,\nbut even so, I must grow stronger.[VAR 0114(0011)]
As I said before, if we are to live in harmony with\nPokémon in this city, then Pokémon must be\r\nafforded the same freedoms that humans enjoy.[VAR 0114(0011)]
And for both sides to enjoy those freedoms, what\nwe will need is incredible strength.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Strength cannot solve everything for us. But it will\nat least allow us to protect what we hold dear.[VAR 0114(0011)]
I will prove the truth of my words by rising to the\nvery top of the Z-A Royale. Rank A will be mine.[VAR 0114(0011)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Now, [VAR 0100(0000)]... Shall we\nbegin\r\nour\r\nmatch?[VAR 0114(0011)]
Let’s do it
Hold on
I will wait as long as you need.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Gwynn, please lend me your phone. I promise I\nwill do my utmost not to break it.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Promotion Match — Rank: E\nOpponent Ivor authenticated!
The promotion match will now begin!
The Trainer who wins will be promoted to [VAR FF00(0006)]Rank D[VAR FF00(0000)].
There are places in life you cannot reach without\nclimbing over strong opponents to get there.[VAR 0114(0011)]
I’d like to see you try!
I’m the strong one here!
I’ll be climbing ahead, then!
Strength is power! Strength is justice![VAR 0114(0011)]
[~ 729]
Time to Mega Evolve, Falinks! Justice WILL win\nthe day![VAR 0114(0011)]
[~ 731]
Your victory is confirmed!
Congratulations! Now processing your promotion.
You’ve been promoted to [VAR FF00(0006)]Rank D[VAR FF00(0000)]!
My justice...didn’t prevail.[VAR 0114(0011)]
It is clear I must train even harder.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Fine, but no more battling in the Z-A Royale after\ndaybreak. That isn’t how it works.[VAR 0114(0012)]
If you continue to vex everyone around you, your\ngoal will only grow harder to reach.[VAR 0114(0012)]
*sniffle* Understood...[VAR 0114(0011)]
It’s true that I act before I think, and that I’m\nterrible at controlling my own strength.\c\nI don’t even know how many smartphones I’ve\nbroken at this point...[VAR 0114(0011)]
Perhaps if you assisted me as my coach, we could\nwork on fixing these things together?[VAR 0114(0011)]
Out of the question.[VAR 0114(0012)]
You’re the elder of us and the master of this dojo.\nStop making others take care of your messes.[VAR 0114(0012)]
I’ll have more to say on this once we’re home.\nLet’s go, Ivor.[VAR 0114(0012)]
Uh—please, one moment, Gwynn. I want to give\n[VAR 0100(0000)] my thanks.[VAR 0114(0011)]
As a token of gratitude for our fine battle, please\naccept this small gift from me.[VAR 0114(0011)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]It was a good match, [VAR 0100(0000)].\nI\r\nwould\r\nbe\r\nhonored\r\nif\r\nyou\r\nwould face me again!\c\nNext time, my power will surely open my path\nforward![VAR 0114(0011)]
Now, if you will excuse me...[VAR 0114(0011)]
[~ 749]
Kyururu!
Wow, it sounds like you had a lot of fun!\c\nWho’d have thought that X and Y axes would end\nup being clues in a missing persons case?[VAR 0114(000C)]
X and Y, huh? I remember hearing something\nabout that a long time ago...[VAR 0114(0006)]
X and Y, huh? I remember hearing something\nabout that a long time ago...[VAR 0114(0005)]
What sort of something?[VAR 0114(000B)]
How did it go...?\c\nSomething about how the X and Y axes go in\ndifferent directions, but there’s still a point where\r\nthey meet, and finding it is the important thing.[VAR 0114(0006)]
How did it go...?\c\nSomething about how the X and Y axes go in\ndifferent directions, but there’s still a point where\r\nthey meet, and finding it is the important thing.[VAR 0114(0005)]
I’m not sure I get it...\c\nYou mean like how people and Pokémon are\ntotally different, but we should focus on the\r\nthings we share?[VAR 0114(000C)]
It could be that—or something like us all here!\nWhat’re the odds we’d meet and become friends?[VAR 0114(0006)]
It could be that—or something like us all here!\nWhat’re the odds we’d meet and become friends?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Hm?[VAR 0114(0006)]
Huh?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Something the matter?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Nah, it’s nothing.\c\nBut I should be asking you what’s the matter,\nNaveen! Why won’t you just try the croissant\r\ncurry already?[VAR 0114(0006)]
Nah, nothing to worry about.\c\nI’m more wondering if something’s the matter on\nyour end, Naveen! You still won’t try my good old\r\ncroissant curry, huh?[VAR 0114(0005)]
That won’t be happening.\c\nWhile I admit that it might taste good, the\naesthetics are still too much for me.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Hey, that’s not as hard of a pass as you gave\nbefore, Naveen![VAR 0114(000C)]
Maybe this means we’re finding where our X and\nY axes meet![VAR 0114(000C)]
Kyururu!

The next day...
Your alarm is going off...
[~ 2]
Good morning.[VAR 0114(000B)]
No sign of [VAR 0100(0001)] or Lida just yet.[VAR 0114(000B)]
At last, I’ve been granted the calm, quiet morning\nI’ve longed for...[VAR 0114(000B)]
Now I can finally make some progress on my\nsewing commissions![VAR 0114(000B)]
In fact, I’m so pleased that I’ll even include you in\nmy happy mood.[VAR 0114(000B)]
You received a pair of Performance Sneakers!
Think nothing of it. I got them as thanks for a\nsewing project, and they’re not my size.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Hey! [VAR 018B(0001)]![VAR 0114(000C)]
Do you know where [VAR 018B(0001)] is?[VAR 0114(000C)]
Not here. [VAR 1100(00FF,0102)]ShHe must’ve headed out earlier to be\nh[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]eris helpful self around the city.[VAR 0114(000B)]
That idiot![VAR 0114(000C)]
Apparently, [VAR 1100(00FF,0001)]she borrowed some money to shoot a\nHotel Z promo spot. So we’re in debt now—to this\r\nscary group called the Rust Syndicate![VAR 0114(000C)]
What? THE Rust Syndicate?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Yes, them! The ones so scary even a rampaging\nalpha Pokémon wouldn’t dare mess with them![VAR 0114(000C)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Hello. This is [VAR 0100(0000)], right?\nThe\r\nkid\r\nwho\r\nlives\r\nand\r\nhelps\r\nout\r\nat\r\nHotel Z?[VAR 0114(0004)]
That’s me!
That’s not me
Well, aren’t you an honest one. Or maybe just\nnaive? You should be more careful about\r\nanswering questions from unfamiliar callers.[VAR 0114(0004)]
Please, no need to play dumb. Let’s not waste\neach other’s time.[VAR 0114(0004)]
Now, I’m calling as a representative of the Rust\nSyndicate.\c\nAnd I wanted to discuss a bit of money your\nfriend [VAR 018B(0001)] borrowed from us.[VAR 0114(0004)]
I could have just dropped in at that fine hotel you\nwork at...[VAR 0114(0004)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]But I figured you would want to avoid a scene.\nEspecially since [VAR 018B(0001)] has been\r\nworking\r\nso\r\nhard\r\nto\r\nbring\r\nin\r\nnew\r\ncustomers.[VAR 0114(0004)]
So I ask that you kindly stop by our office. You’ll\nfind it in the Bleu District.[VAR 0114(0004)]
We’ll be waiting for you.[VAR 0114(0004)]
What...what was that call about?[VAR 0114(000C)]
About [VAR 018B(0001)]
About the money
[VAR BD06(0000)]What? So it wasn’t just me they called? They even\ntracked down your number,\r\n[VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(000C)]
How deep in trouble are we, exactly?[VAR 0114(000B)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Well, [VAR 018B(0001)] didn’t borrow a ton to\nbegin with.[VAR 0114(000C)]
But the interest on the loan is out of control![VAR 0114(000C)]
I hear the Rust Syndicate makes it impossible for\nyou to pay back your interest—then they can force\r\nyou to work off your debt by doing their bidding...[VAR 0114(000B)]
If that’s true, we’re dealing with some truly\nheinous people.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Kyururu!
[VAR BD06(0000)]Don’t worry, Floette. We’ll get [VAR 018B(0001)]\nout\r\nof\r\nthis\r\nmess somehow.[VAR 0114(000C)]
If it is true that they force others to work for them\nby imposing unreasonable interest, we must at\r\nleast try to talk things out with them.[VAR 0114(000A)]
It is only through speaking with each other that\nwe can hope to find some satisfactory resolution.[VAR 0114(000A)]
In any case, it seems the only option now is to go\nto the Rust Syndicate’s office, as requested.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Yeah, you’re right, AZ. Especially since they’ve\ncalled two of us now...[VAR 0114(000C)]
I can’t get ahold of [VAR 018B(0001)]...[VAR 0114(000B)]
Hey, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(000C)]
If they already know where to find all of us, I\ndon’t feel great going to their office alone.\r\nYou’ll head over with me, right?[VAR 0114(000C)]
Of course
I’d rather not...
Thanks! I’ll feel a lot better that way.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Come on! There’s no way we’ll get anywhere if\nyou’re not there![VAR 0114(000C)]
If anything happens while we’re gone, we’re\ncounting on you to handle it, Naveen![VAR 0114(000C)]
Wha—? A-all right...[VAR 0114(000B)]
You two...will be OK. Won’t you?[VAR 0114(000B)]
The Rust Syndicate certainly seem disreputable,\nyet I’ve not heard of the police taking any action\r\nagainst them. Make of that what you will.[VAR 0114(000A)]
[~ 53]
We clean the city of dirt and dust! ♪[VAR 0114(001B)]
Watch us grunts wash away the rust! ♪[VAR 0114(001C)]
Hey, looks like we’ve got visitors.[VAR 0114(001B)]
Huh? Whaddya want? Got business with the\nRust Syndicate?[VAR 0114(001B)]
Yes, we’re here to talk
No business, no
If ya got no business, why’re you snoopin’ around\nhere, huh?!\c\nGet lost! I’m gonna hafta clean this whole area\nsince y’all dirtied it with your uninvited visit![VAR 0114(001B)]
Ooh, here to talk, huh?[VAR 0114(001B)]
Well, I’m on guard duty here! I’m too busy keepin’\nan eye on things to listen to your problems!\c\nMaybe if I crush you in a Pokémon battle, you’ll\nrun off and stop botherin’ us![VAR 0114(001B)]
That means you and me are gonna have a one-on-\none match too, li’l girl![VAR 0114(001C)]
Sheesh. Everything about the Rust Syndicate has\na threatening aura, right down to their building...[VAR 0114(000C)]
[~ 65]
Wha— I lost? Hey, you cheated, didn’t you![VAR 0114(001B)]
That’s why you’re never gonna make it past bein’\na guard, see?[VAR 0114(001C)]
Hey, shaddup! I didn’t see you pullin’ a win on\nyour end, either![VAR 0114(001B)]
My battle was much closer! I lost by a hair! It was\npractically a win![VAR 0114(001C)]
You’re standing out in front of our organization. A\nplace where we need to maintain appearances.\c\nI fail to see how you two causing a scene is aiding\nus in this effort.[VAR 0114(0004)]
Now, who are our guests?[VAR 0114(0004)]
Mr. Philippe![VAR 0114(001D)]
Standing guard isn’t just busywork—it’s a vital\nrole in our organization. Please do it properly.[VAR 0114(0014)]
Now then—my name is Philippe. What brings you\nto our humble office today?[VAR 0114(0014)]
We’re here to discuss [VAR 018B(0001)]
We’re here to discuss a loan
Oh, then you must be [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nThank you for coming by so soon after my call.\nI can see you’re taking matters very seriously.[VAR 0114(0014)]
But what a shame to find out that this is the kind\nof people you are...\c\nWas there truly a need to humiliate our guards so\nthoroughly and heartlessly?[VAR 0114(0014)]
What?![VAR 0114(000C)]
I don’t know if I can discuss business with people\nas rude as yourselves.\c\nBut it would also be rude of me to send you away\nwhen you came all the way here...[VAR 0114(0014)]
So how about this: I give you a thrashing in battle,\nand we call it even?[VAR 0114(0014)]
If you don’t mind an embarrassing defeat, speak\nto me when you’re ready.[VAR 0114(0014)]
I have no idea how we got dragged into this, but I\ndon’t think we have a choice...[VAR 0114(000C)]
Mr. Philippe’s partner is gonna cut you to shreds!
I don’t mind this place gettin’ all messy if it\nmeans we can see Mr. Philippe in action!
[~ 86]
So, how about you show me what you can do in a\nPokémon battle, hmm?[VAR 0114(0014)]
You’re on!
No thanks...
In that case, I’ll ask you to leave. But then who\nwill help your poor friend, I wonder?[VAR 0114(0014)]
I do like that enthusiasm. But I’m part of the Rust\nSyndicate’s top brass—my approval is hard to win.[VAR 0114(0014)]
I wouldn’t want to leave you with false optimism\nabout how business with us goes.[VAR 0114(0014)]
Hold on! If you want to enter, you’ll need to defeat\nme first.[VAR 0114(0014)]
[~ 94]
Our two stones connect us! Our bond manifests\nin Mega Evolution![VAR 0114(0014)]
[~ 96]
... ... ...[VAR 0114(0014)]
Very impressive. Very impressive indeed, for\nsomeone so young.\c\nI’ve taken the liberty of healing your Pokémon as\na sign of my goodwill.[VAR 0114(0014)]
And as a man of my word, I think it’s time for us\nto talk business. Please follow me.[VAR 0114(0014)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]C-come on, [VAR 0100(0000)]... We\nshould\r\nhead\r\nin\r\nafter him.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Hey! Don’t go off and leave me here![VAR 0114(000C)]
Your partner’s pretty strong too.
Can’t believe you beat Mr. Philippe...
I’m as scared of NOT going in there as I am of\ngoing in... We won’t be safe until we solve this![VAR 0114(000C)]
[~ 105]
Hey! We got us an intruder!
I dunno what you’re tryin’ to accomplish, but\ndon’t go about causin’ trouble for us!
[~ 108]
The atmosphere in the office is tense...
[~ 110]
Into the elevator, please.[VAR 0114(0014)]
[~ 112]
Wait here, please.[VAR 0114(0014)]
These two are here to speak with you, boss.[VAR 0114(0014)]
And who exactly am I speaking with?[VAR 0114(0004)]
They’re the kids here to discuss our business\ninvolving Hotel Z.[VAR 0114(0014)]
So you two came in place of [VAR 018B(0001)], eh?\n[VAR 1100(00FF,0102)]ShHe’s too good to come h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]erimself?[VAR 0114(0004)]
But tell me, Philippe, why don’t our guests have a\nscratch on them?[VAR 0114(0004)]
You were supposed to crush their spirits. Make\nthem more persuadable.[VAR 0114(0004)]
Sorry, boss... They’re stronger than they look.[VAR 0114(0014)]
You don’t say? Well, isn’t that interesting...[VAR 0114(0004)]
So, you two... I take it you’re here to talk some\nsort of deal? Better make it worth my time.[VAR 0114(0004)]
Um, I’m sorry, can I ask...who are you?[VAR 0114(000C)]
This is the boss of the Rust Syndicate.[VAR 0114(0014)]
Mr. Corbeau.[VAR 0114(0014)]
Never really wanted the title of boss, I’ll have you\nknow. But Philippe there shoved it on me.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Your talents far exceed my own, sir. It’s only\nnatural I would surrender the boss’s seat to you.[VAR 0114(0014)]
Bah, enough of that! We’ve got guests—this isn’t\nthe time to be discussing our internal affairs.[VAR 0114(0013)]
And where are my manners. I’ve kept our guests\nstanding this whole time![VAR 0114(0013)]
Have a seat on those sofas, why don’t you?\nThey’re real comfy...\c\nOur guests all love ’em. In fact, they never seem to\nwant to leave ’em...\c\nAt least, not before agreeing to everything we ask.[VAR 0114(0013)]
[~ 131]
Now then, let’s talk business.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Like I said, though, you better make it worthwhile.\nOtherwise, who knows what may happen to you?[VAR 0114(0013)]
We promise we’re taking this super seriously.[VAR 0114(000C)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]We...we had to come in [VAR 018B(0001)]’s place\nbecause\r\nwe couldn’t get ahold of h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]erim.[VAR 0114(000C)]
To be honest, though, we’re not sure why [VAR 1100(00FF,0001)]she\ncame to you for a loan in the first place.[VAR 0114(000C)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]I guess I’d interpret your friend\n[VAR 018B(0001)]’s\r\nlack\r\nof\r\ncommunication as an attempt to save you from\r\nworrying. [VAR 1100(00FF,0102)]ShHe’s such a caring [VAR 1100(00FF,0304)]girlboy, after all.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Fill them in, Philippe.[VAR 0114(0013)]
This whole deal began when I encountered\n[VAR 018B(0001)] out helping people in the city.[VAR 0114(0014)]
[VAR 1100(00FF,0102)]ShHe was lending a hand to a member of our\norganization, so I asked h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]erim if there was any way\r\nwe could help in return—as thanks, of course.[VAR 0114(0014)]
[VAR 1100(00FF,0102)]ShHe mentioned that the hotel [VAR 1100(00FF,0001)]she was helping out\nat was struggling to get customers...[VAR 0114(0014)]
And I thought it was the perfect opportunity to\noffer our assistance. One of our services is\r\nproviding loans to those in need, you see.[VAR 0114(0014)]
[VAR BD06(0000)][VAR 018B(0001)] was rather enthusiastic about\nthe idea.\r\n[VAR 1100(00FF,0102)]ShHe mentioned needing funds to create some\r\npromotional videos for the hotel.[VAR 0114(0014)]
It was my pleasure to loan h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]erim 100,000 for this\npurpose.[VAR 0114(0014)]
Your friend helped us, so we helped your friend. A\nbeautiful little circle, isn’t it?[VAR 0114(0013)]
Excuse me?![VAR 0114(000C)]
You said on the phone that the interest is already\nup to 1,000,000 now! You call that “helping”?![VAR 0114(000C)]
Naturally I made sure to indicate the terms and\nconditions when finalizing the loan.[VAR 0114(0014)]
Your friend claimed that if [VAR 1100(00FF,0001)]she made a video and\nposted it ASAP, guests would flock to your hotel,\r\nso [VAR 1100(00FF,0001)]she could pay us back in full the very next day.[VAR 0114(0014)]
Wha—? But h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]eris videos aren’t that great anyway.\nWe’d be lucky if one of them broke even 10 views.\r\nThey’re certainly not bringing in a lot of guests...[VAR 0114(000C)]
Well, I take financial matters very seriously. I even\npersonally warned h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]erim, you know.[VAR 0114(0013)]
I straight up asked h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]erim, “Are you sure? You’re not\na pro—can you really make a video that good?”\r\nI told h[VAR 1100(00FF,0304)]er sim he shouldn’t be overpromising.[VAR 0114(0013)]
But [VAR 1100(00FF,0001)]she did. So now what I want to know is...\nwhat are you two going to do about the situation?[VAR 0114(0013)]
We need more time to repay you
That interest rate is just crazy!
Aww, poor us! It sounds like we’re never going to\nget our money back, Philippe.[VAR 0114(0013)]
What’s this? Trying to go back on our terms?\nSorry, kid, but a deal is a deal.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Listen, I’ll tell you what.[VAR 0114(0013)]
We can leave the matter of the 100,000 that\n[VAR 018B(0001)] borrowed between h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]erim and us.\c\nThat way, you two only have to deal with all the\nextra interest [VAR 1100(00FF,0001)]she accrued.[VAR 0114(0013)]
How do you expect us to deal with it?[VAR 0114(000C)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]I’m not a monster. I know having this big old debt\nfrom [VAR 018B(0001)] hanging over your head\r\ncan’t\r\nbe\r\nfun.\c\nAnd I doubt you can cough up the money, anyway.[VAR 0114(0013)]
So I’ve got a proposal for you.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Nothing too hard—I just want you to take care of\nsome little jobs here and there for us.[VAR 0114(0013)]
You do well, and I’ll start reducing the interest\nthat is owed to us.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Why should we believe that you’ll actually follow\nthrough on that?[VAR 0114(000C)]
Is this kid trying to test my patience?[VAR 0114(0013)]
Ah, no, no. I shouldn’t be losing my temper at\ninnocent civilians.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Look. I’m cutting you a deal here. Out of the\ngoodness of my heart, I might add.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Now, if you choose to reject my kind offer, then\nwe’ll just show up at the hotel and have a big old\r\nPokémon showdown. Every single one of us.[VAR 0114(0013)]
So, what do you say? I assume you’ll accept?[VAR 0114(0013)]
We accept
No way
What’s that?[VAR 0114(0013)]
Yes! Yes, we accept![VAR 0114(000C)]
Now that’s what I like to hear! Pleasure doing\nbusiness with you.[VAR 0114(0013)]
How much will we have to do before the interest\nis taken care of and we’re done working for you?[VAR 0114(000C)]
Well, if you work really, really hard, maybe just\none job!\c\nOr I could keep giving you more work. It’s up to\nme, really.[VAR 0114(0013)]
So you’re saying you might just keep us working\nfor you forever?[VAR 0114(000C)]
Oh, don’t worry. It...probably won’t come to that.[VAR 0114(0013)]
But look on the bright side—these jobs will all be\nfor the benefit of the city! Just do your best, and\r\nI’m sure everything will go fine.[VAR 0114(0013)]
To be clear, this deal is between you two and the\nRust Syndicate. [VAR 018B(0001)] has no part.[VAR 0114(0014)]
I’ll be in touch.[VAR 0114(0013)]
The exit is over there. Kindly see yourselves out.[VAR 0114(0014)]
[~ 184]
Phew.\c\nI’m so glad we’re out of there. More than half of\nme thought they might not let us go...[VAR 0114(000C)]
Guess now we know firsthand how they rope\npeople into giving ’em free labor forever.[VAR 0114(000C)]
[VAR 018B(0001)] is such an idiot...[VAR 0114(000C)]
But I guess I can’t be THAT mad when I know [VAR 1100(00FF,0001)]she\nwas doing it all to help AZ.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Hey, wouldja clear out already? I’ve got cleanin’\nto do!
As if we’d want to stay here another second![VAR 0114(000C)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Come on, [VAR 0100(0000)]. Let’s head\nback\r\nto\r\nHotel Z.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Money is a very important matter. It has the\npower to destroy friendships.[VAR 0114(0014)]
You borrow our money, that means you answer to\nus until you pay it back.
It’s the results that matter—nobody cares if you\nget them honestly or use a little shortcut...
[~ 195]
We’re back, Naveen.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Oh, you’re alive! Thank goodness...[VAR 0114(000B)]
Kyururu...
Aww, thanks, Floette. Sweet of you to worry\nabout us.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Floette was on edge the whole time you two\nwere gone.[VAR 0114(000B)]
If you’d been any later, she might have unleashed\nher Light of Ruin on the Rust Syndicate.[VAR 0114(000B)]
You can’t let her do that! We really don’t want to\nstart a never-ending feud with those guys.[VAR 0114(000C)]
That’s precisely why I did all I could to keep\nFloette calm. So, how did things go?[VAR 0114(000B)]
They’re using us as unpaid help. Just like the\nrumors said.[VAR 0114(000C)]
So what do we do next?[VAR 0114(000B)]
We can’t really do much until the Rust Syndicate\ngets in touch about what they want us to do...[VAR 0114(000C)]
And we still haven’t managed to get hold of\n[VAR 018B(0001)] either.[VAR 0114(000C)]
For the moment, I guess we should start by\nfiguring out our next steps the Team MZ way.\c\nThat’s right—it’s strategy meeting time![VAR 0114(000C)]
You have no idea how worried I was. I’m glad\nyou’re both safe.[VAR 0114(000B)]
It sounds as if you’ve made some progress with\nthe situation.\c\nI would suggest doing as the syndicate says for\nnow. We can wait and see how things develop.[VAR 0114(000A)]
[~ 211]
[VAR BD06(0000)]What do you say, [VAR 0100(0000)]?\nReady\r\nto\r\nstart\r\na\r\nstrategy\r\nmeeting?[VAR 0114(000C)]
Yeah, let’s get started
Hold on one sec
Sure! Let me know when you’re ready.[VAR 0114(000C)]
I’m not sure what kind of strategizing we can\nreally do against the Rust Syndicate...[VAR 0114(000B)]
OK! Let the strategy meeting begin!\c\nToday’s topic: How are we gonna handle the Rust\nSyndicate’s orders? Or maybe I should be asking:\r\nHow do we deal with the Rust Syndicate overall?[VAR 0114(000C)]
Shouldn’t we try and find out all we can about\n[VAR 018B(0001)]’s debt, for starters?[VAR 0114(000B)]
If I could, I would! But what are we supposed to\ndo when we don’t even know where [VAR 1100(00FF,0001)]she is?[VAR 0114(000C)]
Surely [VAR 1100(00FF,0001)]she’ll make h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]eris way back to the hotel\neventually...[VAR 0114(000B)]
Hey—uh, why are we having a strategy meeting?\nI haven’t gotten any word from Vinnie...[VAR 0114(0006)]
Huh? Is it strategy meeting time? Did I miss an\nupdate from Vinnie or something?[VAR 0114(0005)]
[VAR 018B(0001)]![VAR 0114(000C)]
What’d you go and take out a sketchy loan for?!\nWe’re gonna have to bust our butts to pay it back![VAR 0114(000C)]
Oh, that... Yeah, I did borrow some funds to shoot\na Hotel Z promo spot.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Oh... You found out. Yeah, I did borrow some\nmoney to make a new Hotel Z promo.[VAR 0114(0005)]
But it wasn’t a ton or anything! Nothing worth\ngetting worked up about.[VAR 0114(0006)]
But it was just a little! Nothing to get all worried\nover.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Oh, for sure. Just a little 1,000,000 in interest.\nNo worries, right?[VAR 0114(000C)]
Naw, c’mon, there’s no way. I read all the terms\nwhen I borrowed the money.[VAR 0114(0006)]
No way, that can’t be right. I read all the terms\nwhen I borrowed the money.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Guh.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Wait, what?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Oh man... There’s some REALLY fine print about\ninterest. You’d have to zoom in to even find it.[VAR 0114(0006)]
There IS something about interest. It was so small\nI couldn’t even see it without zooming in...[VAR 0114(0005)]
Well, that’s awfully sneaky. But if it’s there in\nprint, I’m afraid they’ve got us over a barrel.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Hold on—Vinnie’s calling.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Hold on. Getting a call from Vinnie.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Hey, Vinnie. Got more Rogue Mega Evolution\ncases for us?\c\nYeah, please go ahead and send us the info like\nalways.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Hey, Vinnie. Got more Rogue Mega Evolution\ncases for us?\c\nYeah, please go ahead and send us the info like\nalways.[VAR 0114(0005)]
This is gonna be a lot to handle on top of the Rust\nSyndicate’s jobs...[VAR 0114(000C)]
What are you talking about?[VAR 0114(0006)]
What jobs?[VAR 0114(0005)]
The Rust Syndicate is saying it’s still on you to pay\nback the original sum you borrowed, of course.\c\nBut now SOME of us are also stuck working for\nthem till they say your stupid interest’s paid off![VAR 0114(000C)]
Seriously? I don’t know how all this happened\nwhile I was out helping folks, but I’m really sorry![VAR 0114(0006)]
Seriously? I don’t know how all this happened\nwhile I was out helping folks, but I’m really sorry![VAR 0114(0005)]
Hmph. Guess I’ll just add these Rogue Pokémon\nto the strategy meeting agenda.[VAR 0114(000C)]
According to Vinnie’s report...[VAR 0114(000C)]
we’ve got another three locations with Pokémon\nthat’re probably gonna Rogue Mega Evolve.[VAR 0114(000C)]
First, looks like there’s a [VAR FF00(0006)]Mawile[VAR FF00(0000)] in Sector 6 of the\nMagenta District.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Then we’ve got a [VAR FF00(0006)]Barbaracle[VAR FF00(0000)] in Sector 5 of the\nBleu District...[VAR 0114(000C)]
and lastly, an [VAR FF00(0006)]Ampharos[VAR FF00(0000)] in Sector 6 of the Rouge\nDistrict.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Let’s split up who goes where again. Then we can\neach figure out the details of our targets later.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Hope you’re still good with going around and\nhelping on all three, [VAR 0100(0000)]...[VAR 0114(000C)]
So, today’s first mission: handling the Mawile\nthat’s going rogue in Magenta Sector 6!\c\n[VAR 018B(0001)], you can go.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Second mission: helping the Barbaracle in the\nsewers of Bleu Sector 5! I’ll be there.[VAR 0114(000C)]
And third mission: taking care of the Ampharos in\nRouge Sector 6!\c\nThis one’ll be on a rooftop, apparently. Naveen, go\ncheck it out.[VAR 0114(000C)]
I’ll help however I can![VAR 0114(0006)]
I’ll do whatever I can to help![VAR 0114(0005)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Sorry, [VAR 0100(0000)], I know this is a\nlot\r\non\r\nyour\r\nplate.\c\nLet’s focus on the Rogue Mega-Evolving\nPokémon for now, OK?[VAR 0114(000C)]
Please. Save the Pokémon from the suffering that\nRogue Mega Evolution inflicts upon them.[VAR 0114(000A)]
[~ 262]
Apparently, when Mawile Mega Evolves, its\nDefense and Sp. Def go up. It’s gonna be a tough\r\nnut to crack![VAR 0114(0006)]
When Mawile Mega Evolves, its Defense and\nSp. Def increase, so we’re gonna have to really\r\nwork type matchups to our advantage.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Let’s make sure we’re ready as can be before we\ntry and tackle it.[VAR 0114(0006)]
I’ll heal up our Pokémon so we’re all in fighting\nshape.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Fire- and Ground-type moves are gonna be your\nbest bet against Mega Mawile.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Fire- and Ground-type moves should do the job\nwell against Mega Mawile.[VAR 0114(0005)]
The concentration of Mega Power in your vicinity\nis rising rapidly!\c\nWarning: Rogue Mega Evolution is imminent!
I’m ready to handle it!
I need to prepare
[~ 272]
That’s how you do it![VAR 0114(0006)]
Nicely done![VAR 0114(0005)]
Your Pokémon did great! Here—I’ll get everyone\nhealed up.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Your Pokémon did so well! Here—I’ll get everyone\nhealed up.[VAR 0114(0005)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]But, man, [VAR 0100(0000)]...\nEverything’s\r\na\r\nreal\r\nmess\r\nnow.\c\nThe whole team’s in hot water thanks to me. I\nmade a huge mistake taking out that loan, huh?[VAR 0114(0006)]
[VAR BD06(0000)][VAR 0100(0000)]... Everything’s a real\nmess\r\nnow,\r\nisn’t it?\c\nThe whole team’s in hot water thanks to me.\nTaking out that loan was a huge mistake, huh?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Yeah, kinda...
Don’t worry about it
That’s what I figured...[VAR 0114(0006)]
That’s what I figured...[VAR 0114(0005)]
Well, that’s nice of you to say.[VAR 0114(0006)]
That’s kind of you, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0005)]
AZ’s told me not to worry about the hotel so\nmuch, but...I really wanna repay him for all he’s\r\ndone for me, y’know?[VAR 0114(0006)]
AZ’s told me not to worry about the hotel so\nmuch, but...I really want to repay him for all he’s\r\ndone for me, y’know?[VAR 0114(0005)]
I just can’t see someone who needs help and not\ndo something.\c\nI came here to Lumiose looking for someone, but\nas I got to know this place, I really came to love\r\nthe city and its people and Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0006)]

On that note, I gotta go do some people-helping. I\nheard some angry folks are planning to take to the\r\nstreets, so I want to make sure no one gets hurt![VAR 0114(0006)]

I guess this Barbaracle is our “light at the end of\nthe tunnel,” here.[VAR 0114(000C)]
I wonder how many Binacle make up a\nMega Barbaracle...\c\nThough I guess what we should be thinking about\nis how to handle this battle. Barbaracle becomes\r\nRock and Fighting type when it Mega Evolves.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Let’s make sure your Pokémon [VAR 1101(00FD,0302)]isare all healed up\nbefore we try and take it on.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Staryu and I are gonna give this all we got![VAR 0114(000C)]

Great job, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(000C)]
Zehhh!
If Mega Power continues to overflow and saturate\nthis city...[VAR 0114(0019)]
do you not fear that every Pokémon in Lumiose\nmay succumb to Rogue Mega Evolution?[VAR 0114(0019)]
If that happens, we’ll handle ’em too
That’s what we’re trying to stop
I would expect nothing less from one of those\nwhom Zygarde sees potential in.[VAR 0114(0019)]
There is something you should know.[VAR 0114(0019)]
This disaster of Mega Power spilling forth over\nLumiose...\c\nI have reason to believe it began at much the\nsame time as the renovation work on Prism Tower.[VAR 0114(0019)]
This suggests that Quasartico Inc. has some\nconnection to what is happening.[VAR 0114(0019)]
Perhaps Zygarde wishes me to investigate that\nconnection...\c\nI believe Zygarde is wielding me as an instrument\nfor the betterment of Lumiose. It intrigues me.[VAR 0114(0019)]
And it bothers me none.\c\nAfter all, my wish has always been to make a\nmore beautiful city—a more beautiful world.[VAR 0114(0019)]
For that, I am counting on your help. Until we\nmeet again.[VAR 0114(0019)]
It’s weird how Prism Tower keeps coming up in all\nthis, huh...\c\nAZ was worried about it too, wasn’t he?[VAR 0114(000C)]
Before the renovation started, Prism Tower was\nopen for anyone to go in and climb up...\c\nI wonder if they closed it down ’cause they’re\ntrying to hide something?[VAR 0114(000C)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Oh! Before I forget, let me heal\n[VAR 0102(0002)]\r\nand\r\nour\r\nother\r\nhard-working\r\nPokémon![VAR 0114(000C)]
Now I gotta get going!\c\nStaryu and I have to work on our coordination so\nwe can help these poor Rogue Pokémon better![VAR 0114(000C)]
I guess the best way to do that is get battle\nexperience in the Z-A Royale![VAR 0114(000C)]
[~ 326]
How strange...[VAR 0114(000B)]
This Holovator seems to have power, but I can’t\nget it to work at all.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Hm?[VAR 0114(000B)]
What’s wrong?
Notice something?
It seems we’re...being watched.[VAR 0114(000B)]
How did you notice me here?[VAR 0114(0012)]
How could we NOT notice? Did you think you\nwere being subtle?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Quiet.[VAR 0114(0012)]
You have a problem, no?[VAR 0114(0012)]
How do you know that? Did you do something to\nthat Holovator?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Your problem may have a solution...if you beat me\nin battle.[VAR 0114(0012)]
Is this girl actually ignoring me? You’ve got to\nbattle her—not just to find out what she knows,\r\nbut to find out what her problem is![VAR 0114(000B)]
The Holovator isn’t working for some reason.
[~ 341]
Are we doing this?[VAR 0114(0012)]
Get ready to lose
I don’t feel like it...
Then you deserve to be stuck.[VAR 0114(0012)]
Revenge will be ours.[VAR 0114(0012)]
[~ 347]
How terrifying...[VAR 0114(0012)]
[~ 349]
You really are strong.[VAR 0114(0012)]
Sorry, Canari. I couldn’t avenge you...[VAR 0114(0012)]
Wait, I remember you! You were in the Canari\nQuiz Whiz Contest![VAR 0114(000B)]
Quiet.[VAR 0114(0012)]
You won, so I’ll keep my word.[VAR 0114(0012)]
This Holovator...[VAR 0114(0012)]
It’s cursed...[VAR 0114(0012)]
Seriously?!
Can you fix it?
Just kidding. It’s not actually cursed.[VAR 0114(0012)]
Go ahead, Chandelure.[VAR 0114(0012)]
Shaaa!
See? A naughty Phantump was the culprit.[VAR 0114(0012)]
Ah. Well. Er... Thank you.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Chandelure and I must protect this city and its\npeople.\c\nWe can’t hope to save our reputations from Ivor’s\nrecklessness any other way.[VAR 0114(0012)]
I’ll win the next Quiz Whiz Contest! My love for\nCanari is much greater than yours. You’ll see.[VAR 0114(0012)]
I’m sorry that I made you battle. Here—I’ll heal\nyour Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0012)]
The rest is up to you.[VAR 0114(0012)]
Well, that explains her problem with me. But if\nshe thinks she can out-quiz me, she’s wrong.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Now, up we go. Ampharos should be up there.[VAR 0114(000B)]
[~ 370]
Scrafty is raring to go.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Here—I’ll make sure your Pokémon are in good\nshape before we battle.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Ampharos will gain the Dragon type when it\nMega Evolves. Take care with your type matchups![VAR 0114(000B)]
The concentration of Mega Power in your vicinity\nis rising rapidly!\c\nWarning: Rogue Mega Evolution is imminent!
I’m ready to handle it!

[~ 377]
You should go and get backup from Team MZ!
[~ 379]
That was quite the battle. I’ll heal our Pokémon.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Facing these Rogue Mega-Evolved Pokémon can\nbe scary, but I know they need our help.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Now, the Rust Syndicate—they’re the ones I’m\ntruly afraid of. I’d rather not deal with them at all.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Impressive work, Team MZ![VAR 0114(0004)]
I’ve been going around searching for cases of\nRogue Mega Evolution in the hopes of running\r\ninto Zygarde and that mysterious “L” person, but...[VAR 0114(0008)]
no big breakthroughs yet!\c\nL’s actions certainly seem suspicious, but I don’t\nget the sense that he has any bad intentions...[VAR 0114(0008)]
Please let me know if you find out anything\nimportant about L, OK? See you around.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Being a detective seems like a lot of work.[VAR 0114(000B)]

[VAR 1100(00FF,0102)]ShHe’s out helping people

Really? Now?!\c\nSo [VAR 1100(00FF,0001)]she’s got time to help everyone else, but not\nthe friends who have to clean up h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]eris mess?![VAR 0114(000C)]
Hello, hello. I figured you might’ve all arrived back\nat the hotel after this long.[VAR 0114(0013)]
...Eh, I suppose I can drop the act.\c\nLook, we are always watching you. You’re smart\nenough to know what that means, right?[VAR 0114(0013)]
So, how about it? Ready for your first job?[VAR 0114(0013)]
We’ve got a small bunch of troublemakers holed\nup in one of the old buildings in the Bleu District.\r\nI need you to teach them a lesson.[VAR 0114(0013)]
If the Rust Syndicate takes direct action, it could\ndraw a bit too much attention. That’s why I’d like\r\nTeam MZ to handle this for us.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Just think of it as doing the city a service.\nAnyway, don’t let me keep you. Good luck![VAR 0114(0013)]
So the Rust Syndicate is putting us to work\nafter all...[VAR 0114(000C)]
It seems so...
Yes, finally...
Guess we’ve got no choice but to get started.[VAR 0114(000C)]
So we need to “teach a lesson” to some\n“troublemakers” in the Bleu District? I don’t like\r\nthe sound of that...[VAR 0114(000C)]
I...might suggest we leave dealing with any\ntroublemakers to [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(000B)]
Naveen and I can think up other ways to get some\ncash flowing in to fix all this.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Maybe Emma could use some part-time help?[VAR 0114(000C)]
If only I had more sewing commissions...[VAR 0114(000B)]
So it appears that the Rust Syndicate is intent on\nwalking a shadowy path.[VAR 0114(000A)]
[~ 419]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Are you [VAR 0100(0000)]? The one Mr.\nCorbeau\r\nwas\r\ntalking\r\nabout?
Yeah, that’s me
Nope, wrong person
Then get lost and leave us alone, wouldja?
What was the boss thinkin’, sending a kid...?\c\nAh well, whatever. Been waiting for you.
See, I just started renting out this building.
But a bunch of troublemakers moved in while it\nwas empty, and they haven’t left. It’s a real pain...
Head on in if you’re ready to take on those\ntroublemakers.
[~ 428]
Look over there.
See that crowd of wild Pokémon? They’re the\ntroublemakers!
Well, I’ll let you handle this. I’ll be over there in\nthe corner until you’re done.

Go on then! Take care of those rowdy Pokémon!
Is...is it done? Did you get rid of those pesky\nPokémon?
Thank you so much! Now I can finally get started\non moving my office here.
Pretty impressive.[VAR 0114(0004)]
The person you sent did the trick, Corbeau! Thank\nyou very much!
’Course [VAR 1100(00FF,0100)]she did! It’s the Rust Syndicate’s job to\nlook after any citizen who needs help.[VAR 0114(0013)]
I was just stopping by to make sure you handled\nthe job properly.[VAR 0114(0013)]
I take it you’re not very busy
Nothing better to do, huh?
Hmph. You must know there are a lot of wild\nPokémon coming to Lumiose these days, right?[VAR 0114(0013)]
Quasartico’s holo-tech does a pretty good job of\nkeeping them in set areas and out of trouble.[VAR 0114(0013)]
But some make their way into the city and cause\nproblems for people and other Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0013)]
This trend has forced some Pokémon out of their\nusual habitats—and into our living spaces.[VAR 0114(0013)]
It’s tough not having a place where you belong. It\nwas the same for me back when I was a kid.[VAR 0114(0013)]
You went through something like that too? The\nfamous, fearless Corbeau?
But—wait, that makes it sound like we’re the bad\nguys, chasing those Gengar from their home...
Geh...?
Looks like you didn’t take care of every last\ntroublemaker, did you? Now that’s sloppy work...[VAR 0114(0013)]
So, what’re you gonna do with that Pokémon?[VAR 0114(0013)]
I’ll look after it and see how things go.\c\nI feel bad chasing it out of its home... I think we\ncan live together, at least for now.
Well then. I’ve got your next job lined up already.[VAR 0114(0013)]
I need you to help out one of my people. She’ll be\non the riverbank near the electrical substation.[VAR 0114(0013)]
I need you to take care of some...undesirable\nelements down there.[VAR 0114(0013)]
I feel bad chasing Gengar out of its home... I think\nwe can live together, at least for now.
[~ 457]
You’re [VAR 0100(0000)], right?
That’s me!
Nope, sorry
Hm. Guess I got the wrong person?
Great, follow me.
[~ 463]
I need you to destroy all the Mega Crystals here in\nthe sewers.
There’s a lot of ’em. Be ready to break a sweat.
You can keep any Mega Shards that you find\nwhen you destroy the Mega Crystals. Good luck.
[~ 467]
I need you to destroy all the Mega Crystals here\nin the sewers.
Good work in there.
Lettin’ those Mega Crystals grow willy-nilly could\nmake this sewer real crowded for Pokémon.
So we in the Rust Syndicate try to clean ’em up.\nOn the boss’s orders, obviously.
What are Mega Crystals, anyway? I’ve heard\nthey’re chunks of Mega Power...
But that just begs the question of what in the\nworld Mega Power is, right?
In any case, the Mega Crystals are gone, so\nlet’s go.
You destroyed all the Mega Crystals!
[~ 476]
Thanks for taking care of that pesky mess down\nthere.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Say, is it true you’re going around calming Rogue\nMega-Evolved Pokémon?[VAR 0114(0013)]
It’s true
I can’t say
I see...[VAR 0114(0013)]
Please, there’s no point hiding it. As I already told\nyou, we’re always watching.[VAR 0114(0013)]
One more question.[VAR 0114(0013)]
I know a guy showed up after you calmed one of\nthose Rogue Pokémon recently. Who was he?[VAR 0114(0013)]
He’s just called “L”
I don’t know him well
You don’t even know his real name, huh?[VAR 0114(0013)]
You don’t know him, eh.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Well, that gentleman’s name is [VAR FF00(0006)]Lysandre[VAR FF00(0000)].[VAR 0114(0013)]
He is—or was—a very wealthy and generous\nbusinessman.\c\nHe helped me out when I was a kid. Provided me\nwith support since I had no family to rely on.[VAR 0114(0013)]
I...don’t know why he did what he did five years\nago, or what he’s been up to since.[VAR 0114(0013)]
But if he’s alive, that means I can repay him for\neverything he’s done for me.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Oh, but look at me, talking to myself. You better\nnot breathe a word of this to anyone, understand?[VAR 0114(0013)]
Otherwise, that interest... It might become a LOT\nmore of an issue for you.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Anyway, I have another job for you.\c\nWe’ve got a little problem with some outsiders\ncausing trouble on our turf. It might get nasty...\r\nbut you should be able to handle it for me, right?[VAR 0114(0013)]
You’ll know what’s up if you head to the battle\ncourt near Centrico Plaza. Go take care of it.[VAR 0114(0013)]
You heard the boss’s orders. You’d better listen\nto him.
[~ 498]
Now, for your Roselia, I’d strongly suggest having\nit learn the special move Giga Drain.[VAR 0114(0036)]
It’s true that its current move, Poison Sting, has\nan appealing additional effect. However, you\r\nshould note that it’s a physical move.[VAR 0114(0036)]
I would also suggest Calcium for Roselia, but I\nrealize your pocket money might be limited.[VAR 0114(0036)]
Hm? Are you here for some battle advice as well?[VAR 0114(0036)]
Um... Can you talk to these fancy-pants for us?\nThey’re from the [VAR FF00(0006)]Society of Battle Connoisseurs[VAR FF00(0000)].
We were just having battles on our own when\nthey came up and started lecturing us...
I bet they’re just trying to show off to us because\nnobody their own age will put up with them.
You think you can take us on? You do look\nsomewhat capable.[VAR 0114(0036)]
If nothing else, it should provide a nice warm-up\nfor our next gathering.[VAR 0114(0037)]
Very well! If you feel you’re ready to face the two\nof us, then come speak to me.[VAR 0114(0036)]
All we wanna do is battle. All this lecturing is just\ngetting in our way.
If you want to face the two of us, you must speak\nto my friend here first![VAR 0114(0037)]
[~ 511]
You seem quite confident in your skills, but do\nyou really think you can beat both of us?[VAR 0114(0036)]
Of course
Maybe not...
Wise decision.[VAR 0114(0036)]
We participate in very advanced battles at the\nSociety of Battle Connoisseurs. Let me show you\r\na glimpse of our skill![VAR 0114(0036)]
[~ 517]
Honestly, this location is just too...drab for my\nPokémon to show their full potential.[VAR 0114(0036)]
I will make sure the name of the Society of Battle\nConnoisseurs remains untarnished.[VAR 0114(0037)]
I’ll face you next. I’m stronger than him, you\nknow. Do you still want to battle?[VAR 0114(0037)]
You bet
Give me a moment
Feel free to excuse yourself, then.[VAR 0114(0037)]
Prepare yourself, for I am far stronger than him!\nMy love for Pokémon battles knows no bounds![VAR 0114(0037)]
[~ 525]
Impossible! We’re both members of Jacinthe’s\nillustrious Society of Battle Connoisseurs![VAR 0114(0037)]
You shouldn’t be able to defeat the two of us![VAR 0114(0036)]
This will leave a stain on the reputation of our\nesteemed society and tarnish our brand...[VAR 0114(0037)]
I think we need to call for reinforcements to sort\nthis out.[VAR 0114(0036)]
Hello there, you two.\c\nI heard word you’ve been acting like you own this\nplace. Too bad you had to go and lose to a kid.[VAR 0114(0013)]
People are on edge as it is these days, what with\nall the wild Pokémon showing up in town.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Hardly seems like a good time to be going around\ntroubling our city’s children, now does it?[VAR 0114(0013)]
You’re Corbeau of the Rust Syndicate, aren’t you?\c\nThe one who fancies himself some kind of outlaw\nhero for the masses.[VAR 0114(0037)]
So YOU sent this boor here to humiliate us? Well,\nwe’ll have our revenge someday![VAR 0114(0036)]
You all should head home for today too, kiddos.\nWatch out for any strangers![VAR 0114(0013)]
Whew, I’m glad you got us out of that. Thank you!
I don’t think of myself as a hero, you know.\nSomeone has to take action. That’s all.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Anyway, you really are strong, aren’t you?[VAR 0114(0013)]
And yet you don’t boast or show off... Why,\nnobody even knows that you’re the one calming\r\nRogue Pokémon. You’re an interesting one.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Please, I must ask you to desist! This is ridiculous!
What’s happening now?\c\nYou’re coming with me to find out![VAR 0114(0013)]
[~ 542]
As I have said many times already, there is\nabsolutely no cause for you to be concerned![VAR 0114(000D)]
You say that, but who knows what you’re doing\nbehind the scenes!
The number of wild zones keeps increasing! Isn’t\nthat the true goal of your redevelopment plan?
[VAR 0100(0000)]? And...Corbeau, sir?![VAR 0114(0006)]
[VAR 0100(0000)]? And...Corbeau, sir?![VAR 0114(0005)]
Now here’s an unexpected pairing. The CEO of\nQuasartico and [VAR 018B(0001)] together, huh?[VAR 0114(0013)]
Care to explain all the ruckus?[VAR 0114(0013)]
You’ve heard the rumors that Quasartico’s behind\nall the wild Pokémon coming to the city, right?\r\nWe want to hear the truth from the CEO!
But those rumors are ridiculous!\c\nI came here because I’d heard these people might\ntry to start something with Quasartico—and good\r\nthing I did! This crowd won’t listen to reason![VAR 0114(0006)]
But those rumors are ridiculous!\c\nI came here because I’d heard these people might\ntry to start something with Quasartico—and good\r\nthing I did! This crowd won’t listen to reason![VAR 0114(0005)]
And who are you two? We’re trying to keep our\ncity safe—if you’re going to get in our way,\r\nthen you’ll have to face my Pokémon!
“Keep our city safe”? Don’t make me laugh.[VAR 0114(0013)]
[VAR BD06(0000)][VAR 018B(0001)]! Get the president away from\nthis mess![VAR 0114(0013)]
Got it![VAR 0114(0006)]
Got it![VAR 0114(0005)]
This way, ma’am![VAR 0114(0006)]
This way, ma’am![VAR 0114(0005)]
Well, isn’t this an interesting turn of events.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Though I’m not sure how I ended up protecting a\nscoundrel who won’t even repay a debt...[VAR 0114(0013)]
You’re kinder than you act
You’re a good person
Give me a break! Nice people don’t end up in my\nline of work.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Still, I can’t just abandon folks who are in trouble.\nThat’s below even me.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Come on now, I’ll lend a hand—that makes two\nagainst one. I never said I’d play nice![VAR 0114(0013)]
[~ 567]
Where did you two come from?! You’re so strong!
But we’ll uncover the evil deeds of Quasartico\nsomeday! You haven’t seen the last of us!
That’s what every defeated villain says. I guess\noriginality wasn’t their strong suit.[VAR 0114(0013)]
My Scolipede is pretty strong, though, eh?[VAR 0114(0013)]
Thanks for the assist, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nGlad you came when you did. I was at a loss for\nhow to handle a crowd that big.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Thanks for the help, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nGlad you came when you did. I was at a loss for\nhow to handle that many people.[VAR 0114(0005)]
And...thank you too, Corbeau, sir.[VAR 0114(0006)]
And...thank you too, Corbeau, sir.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Don’t worry about it.\c\nCouldn’t have you getting injured—otherwise,\nwe’d have to wait even longer to get our money.\r\nNot that we’d mind you racking up more interest.\c\nBesides, the Rust Syndicate deals in favors, not\nviolence.[VAR 0114(0013)]
So... You there, Quasartico president lady...[VAR 0114(0013)]
What that rabble was going on about—how the\nwild Pokémon are coming here because of\r\nQuasartico... Any truth to that?[VAR 0114(0013)]
First, allow me to offer my thanks for your help.[VAR 0114(000D)]
And what is true is that we at Quasartico Inc. aim\nto make Lumiose City into a place where people\r\nand Pokémon will coexist in harmony.[VAR 0114(000D)]
However, we also know it is unreasonable to\nsimply dream we can live alongside wild Pokémon\r\nwith no protections needed.[VAR 0114(000D)]
Our holo-tech encloses the wild Pokémon to keep\nLumiose’s people safe—though I also hope to\r\nsomeday remove all such walls between us.[VAR 0114(000D)]
Yeah, I really hope all that’s true.\c\nIt would be a shame for something to happen to\nthis city. I do love this place, in spite of everything\r\nI’ve been through here.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Well, thanks for putting in a bit of overtime, kid.\nI’ll be in touch.[VAR 0114(0013)]
You are one of the other Pokémon Trainers that\nVinnie reports to me about, I believe?\c\nAnd you stay with AZ at his hotel?[VAR 0114(000D)]
I hope you’ll continue to help us with keeping\nLumiose safe.[VAR 0114(000D)]
I’ll stick with President Jett and make sure she\ngets back OK.\c\nI’d ask Vinnie to handle it, but apparently he’s\noff dealing with some other urgent thing.[VAR 0114(0006)]
I’ll stick with President Jett and make sure she\ngets back OK.\c\nI’d ask Vinnie to handle it, but apparently he’s\noff dealing with some other urgent thing.[VAR 0114(0005)]
You should head back to the hotel. Lida’s\nprobably worried about you.\c\nThough I guess I’m the one that’s given her more\nreason to worry...[VAR 0114(0006)]
Why don’t you head back to the hotel for now? I\nbet Lida’s worried about you.\c\nThough I guess that’s funny coming from me, the\none who’s caused everyone all this worry...[VAR 0114(0005)]
[~ 591]
[VAR BD06(0000)]You’re back, [VAR 0100(0000)]! Do you\nthink\r\nthat\r\nwas\r\nour\r\nlast\r\njob\r\nfor\r\nthe\r\nRust\r\nSyndicate?[VAR 0114(000C)]
Who knows?
Hard to say
Either way, it sounds like the work they’re giving\nyou is just...doing good deeds around Lumiose.[VAR 0114(000B)]
You were breaking Mega Crystals to help\nPokémon and giving aid to people in need, right?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Well, yeah, when you boil it down that way, it\nsounds like plain old volunteer work...\c\nBut you wouldn’t think it’s all so innocent if you’d\nseen Corbeau when he got angry! He’s terrifying![VAR 0114(000C)]
What’s that got to do with anything?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Hey, good work today.[VAR 0114(0013)]
There’s something I’d like to discuss. Stop by our\noffice... Alone, please.[VAR 0114(0013)]
I’ll be waiting.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Was that the Rust Syndicate calling you in?[VAR 0114(000C)]
Yep
Nope
You’re not fooling me.[VAR 0114(000C)]
I knew it...[VAR 0114(000C)]
I dunno what kind of bad luck gets you caught up\nin so much stuff, [VAR 0100(0000)]...[VAR 0114(000C)]
I’m sorry I can’t do more than cross my fingers\nand hope you get back safely.[VAR 0114(000B)]
[~ 609]
We’ve been waiting for you. Now, then, into the\nelevator, please...[VAR 0114(0014)]
[~ 611]
[VAR 1100(00FF,0201)]HShe’s here, boss.[VAR 0114(0014)]
Thanks for coming in.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Is this another job?
What do you need?
You are one interesting kid, aren’t you?[VAR 0114(0013)]
Running odd jobs to help a friend, calming down\nRogue Pokémon... It’s all pretty impressive.[VAR 0114(0013)]
More than anything, I love that you can hold your\nown in a battle![VAR 0114(0013)]
So I’ve decided you’re done working for us! I’ll\nclear all the interest, as promised.[VAR 0114(0013)]
But that’s not actually why I called you here.[VAR 0114(0013)]
You see, I wanted to have a proper, no-holds-\nbarred battle with you.[VAR 0114(0013)]
This is a promotion match announcement for\nTrainer [VAR 0100(0000)] (Rank D).
The opponent for your next promotion match has\nbeen decided.
You are to face Trainer Corbeau (Rank D).
The Trainer who wins will be promoted to [VAR FF00(0006)]Rank C[VAR FF00(0000)].
Now isn’t that interesting.[VAR 0114(0013)]
You’re my next opponent in the Z-A Royale.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Fate itself is telling us we need to battle![VAR 0114(0013)]
Right you are, boss.[VAR 0114(0014)]
So, do you have a Challenger’s Ticket?[VAR 0114(0013)]
Oh, that’s too bad. Well then, go have some fun in\nthe Z-A Royale. I’ll be waiting here.[VAR 0114(0013)]
I love it when someone’s well-prepared. We can\nget right to our promotion match![VAR 0114(0013)]
[~ 633]
You have that Challenger’s Ticket ready?[VAR 0114(0014)]
Rules must be followed. Please obtain a\nChallenger’s Ticket.[VAR 0114(0014)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Suppose I really ought to thank [VAR 0100(0001)]\nfor\r\nintroducing me to an amusing Trainer like you.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Now then, let’s get this started.[VAR 0114(0013)]
I’m looking forward to it
Hold on a moment
You messing with me or something?[VAR 0114(0013)]
The best part of battle is facing a Trainer who’s\ngot talent...and then sending them home crying![VAR 0114(0013)]
You’re acquainted with Lysandre too, yeah? That’s\nproof enough for me that you’re no pushover!\c\nI want to experience every drop of your skill as a\nPokémon Trainer![VAR 0114(0013)]
“Acquainted” might be a strong word
Hey, I barely even know the guy
Oh, come on. Let’s not argue semantics.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Promotion Match — Rank: D\nOpponent Corbeau authenticated!
The promotion match will now begin!
The Trainer who wins will be promoted to [VAR FF00(0006)]Rank C[VAR FF00(0000)].
People, Pokémon... We all get covered in the\ngrime of the world as we go through life.\c\nThis city needs people willing to get their hands\ndirty cleaning up all that mess![VAR 0114(0013)]
As a kid, I had no home, nowhere to go...until\nLumiose gave me a place where I could belong.\r\nI aim to protect this city in any way I can...\c\nAnd for that, I need more influence. I need to\nreach Rank A![VAR 0114(0013)]
I’ll win, and I’ll protect Lumiose!
I’ll be the one reaching Rank A!
I’ll wipe that smile off your face!
For now, I’m just gonna enjoy my battle with you\nto the fullest![VAR 0114(0013)]
[~ 655]
Scolipede! As long as you’re with me, I can face\nany pinch with a smile![VAR 0114(0013)]
[~ 657]
Your victory is confirmed!
Congratulations! Now processing your promotion.
You’ve been promoted to [VAR FF00(0006)]Rank C[VAR FF00(0000)]!
Don’t know if Lysandre sees your talent, but I do.\c\nI see what you can bring to this city.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Here’s a TM as a sign of my respect!\c\nIt’s for the move Gunk Shot. You should have all\nyour Pokémon learn it.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Thanks again. It was a good battle![VAR 0114(0013)]
You know, we could use someone like you in the\nRust Syndicate. What do you say?[VAR 0114(0013)]
I’m a member of Team MZ, so...
Ooh, really? Sounds like fun!
Fair enough. I respect you sticking to your crew.[VAR 0114(0013)]
No, forget I brought it up.\c\nI appreciate your enthusiasm, but you’re part of\nTeam MZ. You need to stick with your crew.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Team MZ must be one heck of a team—especially\nwith you on it.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Though I don’t think I’m quite done with you yet.\nI’ll see you at Hotel Z.[VAR 0114(0013)]
[~ 671]
Way to go, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nYou beat Corbeau, and you’re a rank higher too![VAR 0114(000C)]
I bet the Rust Syndicate will keep off our backs\nnow that you’ve defeated Corbeau.\c\nIt would look pathetic if they kept trying to boss\nus around after a loss like that.[VAR 0114(000B)]
They won’t fully leave us alone till we pay back\nwhat [VAR 018B(0001)] owes them, though.[VAR 0114(000C)]
So it’s time for us to chip in as a team and clear\n[VAR 018B(0001)]’s debt![VAR 0114(000C)]
Just when I’d finally started saving up some real\nmoney from my sewing commissions...[VAR 0114(000B)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]You’d better be chipping in too,\n[VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(000B)]
At least once we pay this off, we should be free\nfrom the Rust Syndicate for good. I don’t wanna\r\nhave anything else to do with them![VAR 0114(000C)]
I’m super sorry, guys... I promise I’ll pay you all\nback real soon...[VAR 0114(0006)]
I’m so sorry, everyone. I promise I’ll pay you all\nback as soon as I can...[VAR 0114(0005)]
We all help each other in this team
At least we’re getting it sorted out
[VAR BD06(0000)]Did you at least manage to take care of whatever\nwas pulling you away this whole time,\r\n[VAR 018B(0001)]?[VAR 0114(000C)]
Yeah, it all worked out OK.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Yeah, it worked out OK.[VAR 0114(0005)]
I was trying to keep the president of Quasartico\nsafe. Funny thing is, Corbeau showed up to help.[VAR 0114(0006)]
I was trying to keep the president of Quasartico\nsafe. Funny thing is, Corbeau showed up to help.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Hold up—do you think the Rust Syndicate is\ngonna say I owe ’em more now?[VAR 0114(0006)]
Wait! Do you think the Rust Syndicate is gonna\nadd on more to my debt for that?[VAR 0114(0005)]
If so, I guess it’s back to doing unpaid labor...[VAR 0114(000B)]
Kyururu.
Hello, hello! Anyone here?[VAR 0114(0004)]
Ohmygosh! A guest?![VAR 0114(000C)]
So this is Hotel Z, eh? Not bad at all.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Wh-what are YOU doing here?!\c\nOh no—are you gonna have the whole Rust\nSyndicate battling Pokémon here, like you said?![VAR 0114(000C)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Please don’t! We just need a little more time!\nWe’ll pay [VAR 0100(0001)]’s whole debt back\r\ntomorrow![VAR 0114(000C)]
Now, now, what’s got you all on edge?[VAR 0114(0013)]
Think about it: What do most people come to\nhotels for? To book a room, correct?[VAR 0114(0013)]
Or what? Is Hotel Z too fancy for the likes of me?[VAR 0114(0013)]
If you’d like a room, I’d be happy to get you\nchecked in...sir. Follow me, please.[VAR 0114(0006)]
If you’d like a room, I’d be happy to get you\nchecked in...sir. Follow me, please.[VAR 0114(0005)]
You really are huge, old man. You know, word on\nthe street is you’re three thousand years old.[VAR 0114(0013)]
If you would put your name down here.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Of course. Give me your best room, please.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Occupation...? I’ll just put down “handyman.”[VAR 0114(0013)]
There, all filled out. Bet you didn’t expect me to\nhave such neat handwriting.[VAR 0114(0013)]
You’ll find the elevator right over here, sir.[VAR 0114(0006)]
You’ll find the elevator right over here, sir.[VAR 0114(0005)]
It’s time for me to retire. A pleasant evening to\nyou all.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Wh-what’s going on? What was that about?[VAR 0114(000C)]

You even prepared a special breakfast for\nScolipede and the crew.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Here’s what I owe you for my stay.[VAR 0114(0013)]

Actually...I wonder if you might do me a favor.\c\nHelp me fulfill my dream of picking out people\nworthy of wearing my designs! Do this, and the\r\noutfits are yours, free of charge![VAR 0114(003A)]
And to prove yourself worthy...[VAR 0114(003A)]

That would be nice...[VAR 0114(0012)]
But being lumped together with Ivor like this is\nmortifying...[VAR 0114(0012)]
Ah, there she is! Lady Jacinthe has arrived!
Bienvenue and hello to one and all! I am Jacinthe,\nyour humble host for this fine event.[VAR 0114(0015)]
Allow me to begin by thanking each of you for\nmaking the time to attend today’s gathering![VAR 0114(0015)]
We, the Society of Battle Connoisseurs, strive to\nprovide more than simply a venue for battling.[VAR 0114(0015)]
We aim also to help Trainers and Pokémon better\nunderstand, appreciate, and inspire growth in one\r\nanother, all through battles.[VAR 0114(0015)]
Just the other day, we were joined by Galar’s\nformer Champion, Leon, who delivered a very fine\r\nlecture at our invitation.[VAR 0114(0015)]
And today, I have invited a group of exceptional\nTrainers who have recently piqued my interest.[VAR 0114(0015)]
These gifted few have garnered attention in the\nZ-A Royale, held each night on Lumiose’s streets.[VAR 0114(0015)]
Alors, let us begin! As I call your names, please\ncome and join me on the court.[VAR 0114(0015)]
From DYN4MO, the electrifying Canari...[VAR 0114(0015)]
and the venerable Tarragon![VAR 0114(0015)]
From the Fist of Justice, the mighty Ivor...[VAR 0114(0015)]
and the inimitable Gwynn![VAR 0114(0015)]
From the Rust Syndicate, the cunning Corbeau...[VAR 0114(0015)]
and the dependable Philippe![VAR 0114(0015)]
And from Team MZ, the valiant [VAR 018B(0001)]...[VAR 0114(0015)]
and the up-and-coming [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0015)]
Guess that’s us, huh?[VAR 0114(0006)]
Wonder how this is gonna go...[VAR 0114(0005)]
If I have called your name, please gather here![VAR 0114(0015)]
Honored guests!\c\nI, Jacinthe, am thrilled to announce a very special\ntournament for your enjoyment today!\c\nI call it...Le Super-Tournoi de Jacinthe![VAR 0114(0015)]
Huzzah!!!
Oops! That’s my phone. My bad![VAR 0114(0006)]
So sorry! I gotta take this call.[VAR 0114(0005)]
What’s up, Vinnie? Got some Rogue Mega\nEvolution cases for us?[VAR 0114(0006)]
What’s up, Vinnie? Got some Rogue Mega\nEvolution cases for us?[VAR 0114(0005)]
...Got it. I’ll work out a plan with everyone.[VAR 0114(0006)]
...Got it. I’ll work out a plan with everyone.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Um...Jacinthe?[VAR 0114(0006)]
Um...Jacinthe?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Yes, what is it?[VAR 0114(0015)]
It was great of you to invite us, but something\nsuper urgent came up.[VAR 0114(0006)]
We really appreciate the invite, but something\nurgent has come up.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Zut alors! What could possibly be so important?[VAR 0114(0015)]
Come on, let’s go.[VAR 0114(0006)]
We’ve gotta go.[VAR 0114(0005)]
[~ 306]
I can’t believe she got so many hard hitters\ntogether for her own private tournament![VAR 0114(0006)]
I can’t believe she got so many hard hitters\ntogether for her own private tournament![VAR 0114(0005)]
Jacinthe seems like someone we’re gonna need\nto watch out for.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Jacinthe seems like someone we’re gonna need\nto watch out for.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Perhaps you would do better to watch out for\nyourselves after that display![VAR 0114(0016)]
I urge you to kindly reconsider your actions![VAR 0114(0016)]
You still have time—you must return to the venue!\c\nI say this out of concern for your own well-being![VAR 0114(0016)]
Nah, it’s OK. Just put us down as disqualified.[VAR 0114(0006)]
That’s all right. You can disqualify us.[VAR 0114(0005)]
We’ve gotta go help protect the city so that you all\ncan keep enjoying your tournaments![VAR 0114(0006)]
We’ve got to go help protect the city so that you\nall can keep enjoying your tournaments![VAR 0114(0005)]
No! WAIT![VAR 0114(0016)]
OH, COME ON!!![VAR 0114(0016)]
[~ 320]
All right, we need to put together another\nstrategy meeting...[VAR 0114(0006)]
All right, we need to put together another\nstrategy meeting...[VAR 0114(0005)]
But I also just got a request to help someone out,\nso I’ll tackle that real quick on my way back.[VAR 0114(0006)]
But I also just got a request to help someone out,\nso I’ll tackle that real quick on my way back.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Sorry, but go ahead to Hotel Z without me, OK? I’ll\nsee you there soon![VAR 0114(0006)]
Sorry, but go ahead to Hotel Z without me, OK? I’ll\nsee you there soon![VAR 0114(0005)]
Kindly bring [VAR 018B(0001)] back with you.[VAR 0114(0016)]
[~ 328]
[VAR 018B(0001)] told us what happened.\c\nToo bad the call came in the middle of the party! I\nguess Rogue Mega Evolution can strike anytime.[VAR 0114(000C)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Protecting the city requires sacrifices. At least,\nafter seeing [VAR 0100(0000)]\r\nat\r\nwork,\r\nthat’s\r\nmy\r\nconclusion.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Anyway, how was the party?[VAR 0114(000C)]
It looked amazing
It was...a lot
I guess the other half really does live differently.[VAR 0114(000C)]
I’m back![VAR 0114(0006)]
I’m back![VAR 0114(0005)]
Is [VAR 0100(0000)] here yet?[VAR 0114(0006)]
Is [VAR 0100(0000)] here yet?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Clearly! Why didn’t you just come back with h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]imer?\nWhat’d you do, get sidetracked and wander off?[VAR 0114(000C)]
I swung by Prism Tower on my way here, yeah.\nThere was something I wanted to check out.[VAR 0114(0006)]
I swung by Prism Tower on my way here. There\nwas something I wanted to check out.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Fine, whatever![VAR 0114(000C)]
C’mon, we’ve got a strategy meeting to start![VAR 0114(000C)]
[~ 344]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Are you good to start the strategy meeting,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(000C)]
Ready to strategize!
Hold on a minute
Sure thing! Just holler when you’re ready.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Let’s get this strategy meeting going![VAR 0114(0006)]
Let’s get this strategy meeting going![VAR 0114(0005)]
It seems Rogue Mega Evolution has no intention\nof giving us a break.[VAR 0114(000B)]
I hereby declare this strategy meeting open![VAR 0114(000C)]
Here’s our update from Vinnie.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Looks like we’ve got three more spots where\nPokémon are in danger of Rogue Mega Evolving.[VAR 0114(000C)]
First, there’s a [VAR FF00(0006)]Froslass[VAR FF00(0000)] in Aymlis Park in the Bleu\nDistrict.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Then there’s an [VAR FF00(0006)]Altaria[VAR FF00(0000)] in Magenta Sector 4.[VAR 0114(000C)]
The third one is a [VAR FF00(0006)]Venusaur[VAR FF00(0000)] in Jaune Sector 8.[VAR 0114(000C)]
They really pop up all over the place, don’t they?[VAR 0114(0006)]
They sure do pop up all over Lumiose.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Vinnie’s intel says the Pokémon falling victim to\nRogue Mega Evolution are getting stronger, too.[VAR 0114(000C)]
When one’s opponents grow more formidable,\none need only train to match them.[VAR 0114(0004)]
Not a bad suggestion.[VAR 0114(000B)]
I don’t think we can afford to slow down and\nfocus only on training.[VAR 0114(0006)]
I don’t think we have time to mess around with\nextra training while Pokémon could go rogue.[VAR 0114(0005)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Besides, [VAR 0100(0000)] is Rank C in\nthe\r\nZ-A\r\nRoyale\r\nnow.\c\nThat’s plenty strong. There aren’t that many\nTrainers in all of Lumiose who’re stronger![VAR 0114(0006)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Besides, [VAR 0100(0000)] is Rank C in\nthe\r\nZ-A\r\nRoyale\r\nnow.\c\nThat’s plenty strong. There aren’t that many\nTrainers in all of Lumiose who’re stronger![VAR 0114(0005)]
To reach such a high rank is remarkable indeed.[VAR 0114(0004)]
Have you considered entering a tournament? That\nseems like a fine way to train up your team.[VAR 0114(0004)]
That’s true... But our first goal should be to learn\nanything that can help us plan, like the types of\r\nthese Pokémon that might go rogue.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Yeah, knowing your opponent’s type is like\nPokémon Battling 101.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Anything else we need to consider before we\nmove on to assignments?[VAR 0114(000C)]
Alors, that Society of Battle Connoisseurs event\ncomes to mind. How are they faring, I wonder?[VAR 0114(0004)]
Who cares? We turned them down pretty hard.\c\nAfter all, tackling the Rogue Mega Evolution\nproblem is Team MZ’s top priority.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Who cares? We turned them down pretty hard.\c\nAfter all, tackling the Rogue Mega Evolution\nproblem is Team MZ’s top priority.[VAR 0114(0005)]
And what exactly is this “Rogue Mega Evolution”\nproblem, might I ask?[VAR 0114(0004)]
Oh, come on. Does anyone actually think we need\nto go over it again from the start?[VAR 0114(0006)]
Oh, come on. Does anyone actually think we need\nto go over it again from the start?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Wait a minute...
Something’s off...
Now that you mention it, does this strategy\nmeeting feel weirdly...crowded to anyone else?[VAR 0114(000C)]
Er, are you all right, Lida? It sounds like you’re\nimagining things...[VAR 0114(000B)]
Or maybe not.[VAR 0114(000B)]
What are you doing here, Jacinthe?[VAR 0114(0006)]
What are you doing here, Jacinthe?[VAR 0114(0005)]
As the host of Le Super-Tournoi de Jacinthe, I am\nhere to personally escort you back to the venue.[VAR 0114(0015)]
Um... I’m sorry, who is this lady exactly?[VAR 0114(000C)]
C’est moi![VAR 0114(0015)]
I am Jacinthe, leader of Lumiose’s illustrious\nSociety of Battle Connoisseurs![VAR 0114(0015)]
So this is what the city’s elite like to wear.[VAR 0114(000B)]
The fabric of your outfit is certainly gorgeous, but\nwhat really stands out is the craftsmanship.[VAR 0114(000B)]
A keen observation, my dear friend! It seems you\nhave quite the eye for fashion.[VAR 0114(0015)]
Hey, quit cozying up! She’s not with Team MZ![VAR 0114(0006)]
Hey, don’t get too friendly! She’s not part of\nTeam MZ![VAR 0114(0005)]
What does that matter? We are all friends, surely.[VAR 0114(0015)]
We surely are NOT![VAR 0114(0006)]
We surely are NOT![VAR 0114(0005)]
In any case, when might I expect you to join us\nfor the tournament?[VAR 0114(0015)]
I told Lebanne—just consider us disqualified!\nWe’ve got Pokémon to save![VAR 0114(0006)]
I told Lebanne—just mark us as disqualified! We\nhave Pokémon to save![VAR 0114(0005)]
Go back to Hotel Richissime and host your\ntournament![VAR 0114(0006)]
Go back to Hotel Richissime and host your\ntournament![VAR 0114(0005)]
I am afraid that is not possible.[VAR 0114(0015)]
You see, the tournament I planned was perfect in\nevery way. Anything less would be unacceptable.[VAR 0114(0015)]
And the two of you are indispensable in making\nmy perfect dream into a perfect reality![VAR 0114(0015)]
Is it perfect if all your guests are standing around\nwaiting for you?[VAR 0114(000C)]
I left that in the capable hands of my dear right-\nhand woman, Lebanne.[VAR 0114(0015)]
As we speak, the guests are enjoying a lavish\nbanquet of exquisite dishes and spectacular\r\nperformances by renowned artists![VAR 0114(0015)]
Good for them. Now let’s get back to the stuff\nthat actually matters. Lida?[VAR 0114(0006)]
I think that’s enough from Jacinthe. Lida, can we\nget back to Rogue Mega Evolution?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Right! We’ll split this into three missions![VAR 0114(000C)]
First, we need to help the Froslass that’s in\ndanger of Rogue Mega Evolving.\c\nIt’s in Aymlis Park in the Bleu District. Naveen,\nyou take that one.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Second, we have to handle the Altaria in Magenta\nSector 4. I’ll go there once we’re done here![VAR 0114(000C)]
Third and last is the Venusaur in Jaune Sector 8.\n[VAR 018B(0001)], you’ll secure that location.[VAR 0114(000C)]
And like always, you go hit up all of those places,\nOK, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(000C)]
Let’s forget about the SBC party and focus on the\nRogue Mega Evolution problem![VAR 0114(0006)]
Let’s forget about the SBC party and focus on the\nRogue Mega Evolution problem![VAR 0114(0005)]
Alors, Team MZ, I must say that you seem to be\nup to something quite intriguing![VAR 0114(0015)]
But know this—I do not take kindly to those who\nmake light of my tournaments.[VAR 0114(0015)]
Jacinthe seems...eccentric.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Still, the upper crust do know how to dress. Those\nmaterials truly are a cut above.[VAR 0114(000B)]
I really wish we could help those Pokémon before\nthey go rogue...[VAR 0114(000C)]
It’s difficult to know exactly what to do until we\nknow what causes Rogue Mega Evolution...[VAR 0114(000B)]
We may not know what’s causing Rogue Mega\nEvolution yet, but someday, we’ll have to try and\r\nstop it once and for all![VAR 0114(0006)]
We may not know what’s causing Rogue Mega\nEvolution yet, but someday, we’ll have to try and\r\nstop it once and for all![VAR 0114(0005)]
[~ 425]
I wish you’d hustled over a bit faster. I thought I’d\ncatch my death of cold up here.[VAR 0114(000B)]
But I must say, Froslass is a beautiful Pokémon.\nI’m taking inspiration for future designs.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Sorry—I suppose this is no time to be dreaming\nup new pieces.\c\nWe’d better focus on helping that Froslass before\nit suffers too long from Rogue Mega Evolution.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Let’s make sure everyone’s all healed up before\nthe battle starts.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Mega Froslass is an Ice and Ghost type. Using\nGhost- and Fire-type moves should work well.[VAR 0114(000B)]

Alors, that was a Rogue Mega-Evolved Froslass?[VAR 0114(0015)]
Wild Pokémon, Mega Evolving all on their own,\nwithout a Trainer or a warning...\c\nThis certainly poses a serious threat to our city—\none that must not be overlooked.[VAR 0114(0015)]
Jacinthe?!
Why are you here?
I wanted to check in and see if you were ready to\njoin my tournament.[VAR 0114(0015)]
You see, I completely understand the importance\nof protecting this city and its residents...[VAR 0114(0015)]
but my tournament is of equal—if not greater—\nimportance![VAR 0114(0015)]
Look, we’ve got enough on our plate right now.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Your “plate,” is it? Your “plate” is very full?[VAR 0114(0015)]
Erm...yes.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Very well, but please do consider that I have a\n“plate” of my own.\c\nPresently, my plate is full of patience, but that will\nnot last forever![VAR 0114(0015)]
Once you have dealt with your little Rogue Mega\nEvolution errand, please join us at Richissime.\c\nUntil then, I shall use my special methods to\nkeep an eye on you. Adieu![VAR 0114(0015)]
I’m not sure who’s scarier to face: these Rogue\nMega-Evolved Pokémon or Jacinthe.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Anyway, you and your Pokémon did great with\nMega Froslass. I’ll make sure everyone’s healthy.[VAR 0114(000B)]
And, erm, listen... I know this is all a lot to deal\nwith, but you’ve got me in your corner.[VAR 0114(000B)]
[~ 453]
[VAR BD06(0000)]OK, let’s do this! And—thanks,\n[VAR 0100(0000)],\r\nfor\r\nalways\r\nbattling\r\nalongside\r\nme,\r\nif\r\nI\r\nhaven’t\r\nsaid\r\nit\r\nenough.[VAR 0114(000C)]
This may not be a great time to ask, but...we ARE\nhelping you out, right? Naveen, [VAR 1100(00FF,0606)]TaunieUrbain, and me?[VAR 0114(000C)]
Of course you are
You’re a huge help
Phew. Thank goodness.\c\nI know we keep throwing big, annoying tasks at\nyou, since you can handle ’em.\c\nI’ve been feeling kinda guilty about it, but I’m glad\nto know we’re pulling our weight![VAR 0114(000C)]
Let me get everyone healed up.[VAR 0114(000C)]
We’re gonna do our best—me, Staryu, and the\nwhole gang![VAR 0114(000C)]

So that was a Rogue Mega-Evolved Altaria? My\ngoodness![VAR 0114(0015)]
To think something so fluffy and adorable could\nbe capable of such wild rage![VAR 0114(0015)]
Tell me, [VAR 0100(0000)]...\c\nDoes your rapid rise in the Z-A Royale ranks have\nanything to do with your efforts to quell these\r\ncases of Rogue Mega Evolution?[VAR 0114(0015)]
It does
No way
So that fascinating strength of yours was gained\nfor the noble cause of protecting the city![VAR 0114(0015)]
Alors! Your strength is clear as day in battle, yet\nyou pretend to have no grand ambitions...\r\nI must say, I am taking quite a liking to you![VAR 0114(0015)]
That settles it: I am convinced that my tournament\nwill not be complete without you and your gallant\r\nstrength, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0015)]
I urge you to come and join in the festivities as\nsoon as you are able.[VAR 0114(0015)]
Otherwise... Well, I could always buy out Hotel Z\nto encourage your participation. Adieu![VAR 0114(0015)]
Ugh, that lady... The “Z” in Team MZ comes from\nHotel Z![VAR 0114(000C)]
If she buys the hotel and renames it, we’ll have to\ncome up with a whole new team name![VAR 0114(000C)]
But maybe that’s getting ahead of myself a little.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Here, I’ll heal up our hard-working Pokémon![VAR 0114(000C)]
And speaking of Team MZ...I’m really glad you’re\none of us, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(000C)]
That Mega-Evolved Altaria was so fluffy. Wish I\ncould’ve given it a big squeezy hug![VAR 0114(000C)]

It’s Jacinthe. She legit worries me.\c\nI definitely get what Lebanne was trying to warn\nus about now.[VAR 0114(0006)]
It’s Jacinthe. She’s bad news.\c\nI’m pretty sure I get what Lebanne was trying to\nwarn us about now.[VAR 0114(0005)]
It was certainly rude of her to appear at our\nstrategy meeting uninvited.[VAR 0114(000B)]
That’s so far down the list of what worries me\nabout her![VAR 0114(0006)]
That’s the least of my worries about her![VAR 0114(0005)]
But I guess we gotta head to Richissime. The\nlonger we blow her off, the worse it’ll get.[VAR 0114(0006)]
But I guess we should head to Richissime. The\nlonger we make her wait, the worse it’ll get.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Hang on—do you all hear that?\c\nIt sounds like something’s going on outside.[VAR 0114(000C)]
All I want is to celebrate us calming a few more\nRogue Mega-Evolved Pokémon! Instead we get\r\nJacinthe, and now more trouble at our door?[VAR 0114(0006)]
I just wanted to celebrate us calming a few more\nRogue Mega-Evolved Pokémon! Instead we get\r\nJacinthe, and now more trouble at our door?[VAR 0114(0005)]
I’ll go see what’s up.[VAR 0114(0006)]
I’ll go see what’s up.[VAR 0114(0005)]
[VAR 1100(00FF,0606)]TaunieUrbain is dealing with rather a lot, isn’t [VAR 1100(00FF,0001)]she?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Why don’t we join h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]erim out there so [VAR 1100(00FF,0001)]she doesn’t\nhave to handle this stuff alone?[VAR 0114(000C)]
[~ 541]
Why is the hotel surrounded by a... Wait, is this\na battle zone?[VAR 0114(000B)]
I don’t remember battle zones being purple.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Hello and bienvenue to the Jacinthe zone![VAR 0114(0015)]
While similar to the wild zones and battle zones\nyou know, this one is for my own personal use![VAR 0114(0015)]
Please feel free to admire how the color of my\nholo-tech avatar expertly matches the zone![VAR 0114(0015)]
Must you, Jacinthe?[VAR 0114(0006)]
This can’t be real.[VAR 0114(0005)]
No matter how long I wait... No matter how many\ntimes I ask politely...[VAR 0114(0015)]
the two of you still refuse to do what is right:\nparticipate in my wonderful tournament!\c\nThus, to ensure my invitation is accepted, no\nmatter the cost...[VAR 0114(0015)]
I have taken matters into my own hands!\c\nForgive me for resorting to such drastic measures\nand for not being there in person to greet you.[VAR 0114(0015)]
I couldn’t care less that you’re here in hologram\nform—just take down your weird zone already!\r\nOur hotel’s not gonna get any guests like this![VAR 0114(0006)]
I couldn’t care less that you’re here in hologram\nform—just take down your weird zone already!\r\nOur hotel’s not gonna get any guests like this![VAR 0114(0005)]
Isn’t Corbeau from the Rust Syndicate the only\nguest we’ve had recently?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Pretty much, yeah...[VAR 0114(000C)]
Whose side are you two on?![VAR 0114(0006)]
Whose side are you two on?![VAR 0114(0005)]
This is not a “weird” zone! It is a Jacinthe zone,\nand naturally, I will deactivate it in due time.[VAR 0114(0015)]
But in order for that to happen, you must fight!\nFor that is what I wish, and I will brook no refusal![VAR 0114(0015)]
Why’d you have to take things this far?[VAR 0114(0006)]
Why are you doing all this?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Watching h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]iser battles firsthand revealed to me the\ntrue extent of [VAR 0100(0000)]’s talent.[VAR 0114(0015)]
And now, I want nothing more than to see that\nglorious talent shine in my tournament.\c\nSurely that is not too much to ask.[VAR 0114(0015)]
Well then, my dearest Lebanne, I shall leave the\nrest to you. Adieu![VAR 0114(0015)]
I trust you understand my earlier warnings now.\c\nAbout the consequences that await those who\ndare to slight Lady Jacinthe.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Personally, I fail to see the point of these next\nbattles, but our leader commands it.[VAR 0114(0016)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Now then, [VAR 0100(0000)],\nplease\r\nmeet\r\nyour opponent.[VAR 0114(0016)]
I will show you the marvelous battle style we train\nto achieve at the Society of Battle Connoisseurs![VAR 0114(0038)]
[~ 569]
I expected nothing less from you.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Would you like your Pokémon healed?[VAR 0114(0016)]
Yes please
No thanks
Allow me.[VAR 0114(0016)]
While I respect your decision, I urge you not to\nmake things harder on yourself than necessary.[VAR 0114(0016)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Now then, [VAR 0100(0000)],\nplease\r\nmeet\r\nyour\r\nnext\r\nopponent.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Allow me to display the dazzling battle skills I’ve\nhoned at the SBC![VAR 0114(0039)]
[~ 578]
I expected nothing less from you.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Would you like your Pokémon healed?[VAR 0114(0016)]
Yes please
No thanks
Allow me.[VAR 0114(0016)]
While I respect your decision, I urge you not to\nmake things harder on yourself than necessary.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Both of you may return to the venue. I will join\nyou shortly.[VAR 0114(0016)]
LET’S GO![VAR 0114(0016)]
Looks like I finally get to cut loose in a REAL\nbattle for once! Bring it on![VAR 0114(0016)]
Uh, did you drop your personality?[VAR 0114(0006)]
Oh geez. I’ve got a feeling Lebanne is as much\nbad news as Jacinthe.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Shut it, punk! I’ll deal with you next![VAR 0114(0016)]
Get ready for a taste of who I used to be before\nJacinthe came along![VAR 0114(0016)]
[~ 592]
Time for our secret weapon! Mega Evolve so we\ncan drag this kid, Dragalge![VAR 0114(0016)]
[~ 594]
It’s not over yet! I’ll keep fighting till you give up\nand join the tournament![VAR 0114(0016)]
I don’t care if you’re some kinda battle master\nwho doesn’t need healing—I’ll wear you down![VAR 0114(0016)]
Hold on a sec, I just need to heal up my team.[VAR 0114(0016)]
YOU hold on a sec.[VAR 0114(0006)]
YOU hold on a sec.[VAR 0114(0005)]
We were already planning on joining the\ntournament![VAR 0114(0006)]
We were already planning on battling in the\ntournament![VAR 0114(0005)]
...You serious?[VAR 0114(0016)]
Yeesh, maybe start with that next time.[VAR 0114(0016)]
You’re the ones who trapped us in this weird\nzone and wouldn’t listen to a thing we said.[VAR 0114(0006)]
You’re the ones who trapped us in this weird\nzone and wouldn’t listen to a thing we said.[VAR 0114(0005)]
It’s a Jacinthe zone![VAR 0114(0016)]
Oh well. I had a fun battle for the first time in a\nwhile, and Jacinthe’s getting what she wanted,\r\nso I guess I’ve got no complaints.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Well...almost no complaints. To tell the truth, I\nwish I got to fight like this more.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Were you pretending up till now?
Is this version of you the real one?
I used to be a fighter back in the day. The kind\nthat only seeks out the strongest opponents.\c\nYeah, I like settling fights with my Pokémon AND\nmy fists. Don’t like it? Then don’t mess with me.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Anyway, two years ago, I got totally annihilated in\nbattle by Jacinthe, and I’m still paying for it.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Now I’ve gotta talk fancy and wear this crazy\ngetup all because I promised her I would.[VAR 0114(0016)]
So I’ll warn you again—watch out for Jacinthe.\c\nIf you lose to her, you might end up like me.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Promotion match scheduling alert.
This is a promotion match announcement for\nTrainer [VAR 0100(0000)] (Rank C).
The opponent for your next promotion match has\nbeen decided.
You are to face Trainer Jacinthe (Rank C).
The Trainer who wins will be promoted to [VAR FF00(0006)]Rank B[VAR FF00(0000)]!
Ha! Talk about perfect timing.\c\nYou really can’t escape Jacinthe if she’s your\nopponent in your next promotion match.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Hold up, I’ll get rid of the Jacinthe zone.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Jacinthe zone: OFF![VAR 0114(0016)]
Don’t forget, you’re gonna need a Challenger’s\nTicket before you can have a promotion match.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Later! I’ll be waiting back at Hotel Richissime.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Y’know, Jacinthe and Lebanne might be more\nalike than I would’ve first thought...[VAR 0114(0006)]
Y’know, Jacinthe and Lebanne might be more\nalike than I would’ve first thought...[VAR 0114(0005)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Go to Hotel Richissime when you’re ready,\n[VAR 0100(0000)].\r\nI’ll\r\nmeet\r\nyou\r\nthere![VAR 0114(0006)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Go to Hotel Richissime when you’re ready,\n[VAR 0100(0000)].\r\nI’ll\r\nmeet\r\nyou\r\nthere![VAR 0114(0005)]
The SBC, Jacinthe, Lebanne... Honestly, I don’t\nget what any of their deals are.[VAR 0114(000C)]
That was quite a thing we just witnessed. I’m not\nsure WHAT thing, exactly, but quite a thing.[VAR 0114(000B)]
[~ 631]
We gotta fight our way to the promotion match.\nGo earn yourself a Challenger’s Ticket![VAR 0114(0006)]
We’ve got to fight our way to the promotion\nmatch. Go earn yourself a Challenger’s Ticket![VAR 0114(0005)]
Nice, you got yourself a Challenger’s Ticket. Let’s\nhead in, then![VAR 0114(0006)]
Good, you’ve got a Challenger’s Ticket. Guess we\nshould go on in![VAR 0114(0005)]
Do you understand Jacinthe a little better now?[VAR 0114(0016)]
Ready to battle, huh?[VAR 0114(0016)]
OK, gotta get back into work mode.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Would you permit me to take your photo for the\ntournament bracket?[VAR 0114(0016)]
Go right ahead
Let me get changed
I urge you to hurry. Lady Jacinthe is waiting with\ngreat impatience.[VAR 0114(0016)]
I’m good to go, too.[VAR 0114(0006)]
I’m good to go, too.[VAR 0114(0005)]
All right, I will now take your photo.[VAR 0114(0016)]
What kind of expression will you make?
Fierce
Happy
Glum
Neutral
Say “cheese”![VAR 0114(0016)]
Perfect![VAR 0114(0016)]
Kindly follow me to the venue. Lady Jacinthe is\nwaiting for you.[VAR 0114(0016)]
[~ 654]
Finally. We’ve been waitin’ here forever for you,\n[VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(000F)]
What do you mean?
For me? Why?
After you left, we figured the tourney was off.\nBut when we tried to leave, we got trapped in this\r\nweird “Jacinthe zone” thing.[VAR 0114(000F)]
Dear friends and honored guests, I thank you for\nyour patience![VAR 0114(0015)]
I am delighted to announce that my tournament—\norganized by me and in my honor—has recovered\r\nits missing pieces.[VAR 0114(0015)]
Now, have a look at the tournament bracket.[VAR 0114(0015)]
As you can see, I am the ultra-deluxe top seed! A\nfitting position for your humble hostess, no?[VAR 0114(0015)]
She really planned this whole thing to cater to\nherself as much as possible, huh...[VAR 0114(0006)]
Wow. There’s planning things with your own\nconvenience in mind...and then there’s this.[VAR 0114(0005)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]For round one, we have Canari facing off against\n[VAR 0100(0000)].\c\nOnce you are ready, please speak to Lebanne on\nthe court.[VAR 0114(0015)]
Now then, my dear friends—let Le Super-Tournoi\nde Jacinthe commence![VAR 0114(0015)]
Well, this is Jacinthe’s tournament, so I guess\nwe’ve gotta do this even if it seems absurd.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Well, this is Jacinthe’s tournament, so I guess\nwe’ve gotta do this even if it seems bizarre.[VAR 0114(0005)]
[~ 669]
[~ 670]
Your first opponent will be Canari. Are you ready\nto start the battle?[VAR 0114(0016)]
I’m ready
Not yet
I urge you to prepare quickly, before you incur\nLady Jacinthe’s displeasure.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Without further ado, let the battle between\nCanari and [VAR 0100(0000)] begin![VAR 0114(0016)]
I’m just here to show all my adorin’ Canatics how\ncool and strong I am.[VAR 0114(000F)]
This time, I know I’m gonna win![VAR 0114(000F)]
You were draggin’ your feet comin’ here, right?\nWell, good news: you can go home after you lose.\r\nHurry and talk to Lebanne so I can beat you.[VAR 0114(000F)]
Sorry, kid, but Canari’s got this in the bag![VAR 0114(0010)]
I’m excited to see how much stronger your\nPokémon have grown, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0011)]
Oh, Canari... ♥[VAR 0114(0012)]
Good luck, kid.[VAR 0114(0013)]
As you may expect, the Rust Syndicate usually\nprefers to avoid the SBC.[VAR 0114(0014)]
I know you’ve beaten Canari before, but don’t let\nthat lull you into dropping your guard![VAR 0114(0006)]
I know you’ve beaten Canari before, but don’t get\ncareless![VAR 0114(0005)]
I hope you will entertain us with a battle worthy\nof kicking off Le Super-Tournoi de Jacinthe.[VAR 0114(0015)]
How will Lady Jacinthe’s chosen competitors fare\nin battle, I wonder?
What on earth is Lady Jacinthe thinking, inviting\nthe Rust Syndicate? Is this some sort of jape?
[~ 689]
Enough playin’ around! Eelektross, let’s crank up\nthe voltage with Mega Evolution![VAR 0114(000F)]
[~ 691]
&%^@#?&!★#$![VAR 0114(000F)]
!%★@^$*&=§#!!![VAR 0114(000F)]
I lost...again? Me? But...I’m Canari...[VAR 0114(000F)]
Thank you both for that spectacular battle, Canari\nand [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0015)]
I am all excitement and anticipation to see how\nthe rest of the battles play out.[VAR 0114(0015)]
Dear friends and honored guests, we have made\nit to the end of round one.[VAR 0114(0015)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]The Trainers who qualified for the next round are\n[VAR 0100(0000)], Ivor, Corbeau, and\r\nGwynn.[VAR 0114(0015)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]For round two, we have Ivor facing off against\n[VAR 0100(0000)].\c\nOnce you are ready, please speak to Lebanne on\nthe court.[VAR 0114(0015)]
[~ 700]
Your next opponent will be Ivor. Shall we begin\nthe battle?[VAR 0114(0016)]
I’m ready!
Not yet
I urge you to prepare quickly, before you incur\nLady Jacinthe’s displeasure.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Without further ado, let the battle between\nIvor and [VAR 0100(0000)] begin![VAR 0114(0016)]
A quick word, please, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0011)]
I feel you should know that Lebanne here was the\nreason I started my strict training regimen.\c\nShe beat me in a fight when we were children,\nand after that, I...[VAR 0114(0011)]
Hm. On second thought, never mind all that.\c\nI should focus on our match. Let’s have a fair\nfight, yes?[VAR 0114(0011)]
Sorry I lost, G-Volt.[VAR 0114(000F)]
Y’know what kinda tournament I wanna see? A\nscaffolding-buildin’ tournament![VAR 0114(0010)]
Once you have steeled yourself for battle, please\nspeak to Lebanne.[VAR 0114(0011)]
I’ll never forgive you for beating Canari...[VAR 0114(0012)]
Keep it up, kid.[VAR 0114(0013)]
I would enjoy a nice, long chat with that man...\nWith our fists doing the talking, of course.[VAR 0114(0014)]
Remember to check the important things, like\nwhat items your Pokémon are holding![VAR 0114(0006)]
Remember to check the important things, like\nwhat items your Pokémon are holding![VAR 0114(0005)]
My intuition is never wrong! Each fight thus far\nhas been absolutely incredible.[VAR 0114(0015)]
Here I assumed you were invited here on a whim,\nbut you managed to put on a pretty good show.
The Fist of Justice? They’re no more than a vulgar\ngroup spreading propaganda in our streets.
[~ 720]
Falinks! Let us break through the bounds of\njustice with Mega Evolution![VAR 0114(0011)]
[~ 722]
Your power was too great for my justice to crush.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Now that I am stronger, I thought I could defeat\nLebanne and thus heal from my past trauma...[VAR 0114(0011)]
But it seems I still have more training to do.\c\nOn the plus side, though, that means I have room\nto grow! I have high hopes for my future self.[VAR 0114(0011)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]I wish you all the best in your upcoming battles,\n[VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0011)]
Another outstanding battle! Thank you for that\nperformance, [VAR 0100(0000)] and Ivor.[VAR 0114(0015)]
I do hope the remaining battle for this round will\nbe equally enjoyable to watch.[VAR 0114(0015)]
Dear friends and honored guests, we have arrived\nat the end of round two.[VAR 0114(0015)]
The winning Trainers this round were Corbeau\nand [VAR 0100(0000)]...[VAR 0114(0015)]
which naturally means they will be our\ncompetitors in round three!\c\nOnce you are ready, please speak to Lebanne on\nthe court.[VAR 0114(0015)]
[~ 732]
Your next opponent will be Corbeau. Shall we\nbegin the battle?[VAR 0114(0016)]
I’m SO ready!
Not just yet
Lady Jacinthe is eager to watch your battle as\nsoon as possible. Kindly pick up the pace.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Without further ado, let the battle between\nCorbeau and [VAR 0100(0000)] begin![VAR 0114(0016)]
So, I’m up against you.[VAR 0114(0013)]
This is quite the venue. It’s the perfect place to\nrepay you for the defeat you handed me the other\r\nday. I think I’d enjoy that.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Boss! Just remember your training with me!\nYou’ll be fine![VAR 0114(0014)]
That idiot... I’ll need to teach him to keep his\nmouth shut.[VAR 0114(0013)]
But well, me and my crew’ve gotten stronger.\nScolipede and the rest are ready to go![VAR 0114(0013)]
Now then, let’s have some fun![VAR 0114(0013)]
Hey G-Volt, did you try the terrine? It’s crazy good.[VAR 0114(000F)]
I can’t eat another bite...[VAR 0114(0010)]
I shall be watching closely to discern the secret to\nyour strength.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Oh, Canari... ♥[VAR 0114(0012)]
You want to get this going? Then go let Lebanne\nknow that you’re ready.[VAR 0114(0013)]
The boss is going to win! There’s no way he can\nlose![VAR 0114(0014)]
Beat him so hard he’ll never dare put you to work\nagain, OK?[VAR 0114(0006)]
After everything we went through with the Rust\nSyndicate, you better not go losing now![VAR 0114(0005)]
Watching the people of Lumiose come together,\nunited by a love of battling, is...simply sublime![VAR 0114(0015)]
While they may lack the refinement of the SBC,\neach Trainer here displays incredible strength.
I detest the Rust Syndicate... They forced me to\nwork for them, you know.
[~ 755]
You’re our last chance, Scolipede! But this is\nwhere the fun starts![VAR 0114(0013)]
[~ 757]
Blast. Still not good enough, eh.\c\nNot even after I roped Philippe in to help me train\nup, embarrassed as I am to admit it.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Still, battles with you are a good time. Swing by\nour office again if you want to have some fun.[VAR 0114(0013)]
I caught every moment of your battle from my VIP\ncourtside seat.[VAR 0114(0015)]
Thank you for your truly spectacular performance,\n[VAR 0100(0000)] and Corbeau![VAR 0114(0015)]
The Trainer who has fought all the way to the top\nof Le Super-Tournoi de Jacinthe is...\c\nmy personal favorite, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0015)]
In your next battle, you will be facing off against\nnone other than your gracious host...me![VAR 0114(0015)]
Who’s your money on, G-Volt?[VAR 0114(000F)]
I’d like to take some food back for the rest of my\nwork crew, but...who do I ask for to-go boxes?[VAR 0114(0010)]
I will use this chance to learn all I can about the\nbattle tactics of Trainers in the highest ranks![VAR 0114(0011)]
I don’t really care who wins.[VAR 0114(0012)]
You’d better win, kid. I can’t stand that woman.[VAR 0114(0013)]
At last, this long tournament will soon be over.[VAR 0114(0014)]
Alors, the time has finally come.[VAR 0114(0015)]
We might just make it through this OK...[VAR 0114(0016)]
We’re finally at the end! Win this quick so we can\npeace out![VAR 0114(0006)]
Just a little longer! Beat Jacinthe and it’ll finally\nbe our turn to bid her adieu![VAR 0114(0005)]
Lady Jacinthe? Lose? No, perish the thought. The\nvery notion is laughable.
It would be quite a stain on the SBC’s reputation\nif Lady Jacinthe were to lose.
[~ 776]
The time has come for you and I to battle, my\ndear [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0015)]
Time and again, I was delayed in bringing Le\nSuper-Tournoi de Jacinthe to fruition...\c\nIn the end, I had to resort to wielding my\ninfluence as a social elite to make it happen.[VAR 0114(0015)]
Now here we are, about to begin the final round!\c\nMay it live up to—nay, exceed!—the wildest\nexpectations of our lovely guests with spectac—[VAR 0114(0015)]
Zeh!
Uh...what’s with that Pokémon?
How’d it even get in here?
Gah! More trouble?![VAR 0114(0016)]
I don’t know what’s going on, but I can’t afford to\nlet anything else go wrong![VAR 0114(0016)]
Hear Zygarde’s wish.[VAR 0114(0019)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Is that man a fan of [VAR 0100(0000)]’s,\nperhaps?[VAR 0114(0011)]
It can’t be... He’s alive?\c\nThe leader of Team Flare, who vanished after his\nfailed attempt to create the world he dreamed of...\r\nLysandre![VAR 0114(0010)]
Wait, the guy who used that ultimate weapon five\nyears ago? Dang, that’s a shockin’ turn of events.[VAR 0114(000F)]
I don’t care. I want to go home.[VAR 0114(0012)]
Huh? What?! No way![VAR 0114(0014)]
That’s Lysandre! That’s Lysandre over there,\nisn’t it?![VAR 0114(0014)]
Can it, Philippe. Don’t make a scene in front of\nLysandre. You’re embarrassing me.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Zygarde showed itself in order to face you in\nbattle, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0019)]
Its wish is that you two face each other in\nearnest...and forge a strong bond in doing so.[VAR 0114(0019)]
The type of bond that I mean...is a connection\nthat can never be severed.[VAR 0114(0019)]
Without such a mighty bond, you cannot hope to\nsave Lumiose from crisis![VAR 0114(0019)]
I dunno whether to throw this guy out or get\nready to hold Lady Jacinthe back...[VAR 0114(0016)]
How marvelous![VAR 0114(0015)]
I admire the fierce determination that drove you to\ninterrupt our battle to demand your own, my dear.[VAR 0114(0015)]
Alors, I myself desire nothing more than to battle\nagainst [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0015)]
So believe me when I say I can sympathize with\nthis dear Pokémon 1,000 percent![VAR 0114(0015)]
And that entrance! What could be more splendid\nthan a surprise appearance by a special guest?[VAR 0114(0015)]
You are Lysandre, yes?\c\nNaturally, I recognize your visage. You were quite\nthe celebrity in Kalos, after all.\c\nI will ask the hotel staff to come by with more\nhors d’oeuvres...[VAR 0114(0015)]
It doesn’t matter who I was. I remember none\nof it.[VAR 0114(0019)]
I am here only to say that I wish for Zygarde and\n[VAR 0100(0000)] to battle![VAR 0114(0019)]
Yes, of course! By all means.[VAR 0114(0015)]
Lebanne, would you handle this?[VAR 0114(0015)]
[VAR BD06(0000)][VAR 0100(0000)], your next opponent\nwill\r\nbe\r\nthis\r\nmysterious\r\nPokémon, Zygarde![VAR 0114(0015)]
That Pokémon should barge in on one of my\nstreams sometime.[VAR 0114(000F)]
Was this planned, or was it really a surprise?[VAR 0114(0010)]
That Pokémon—Zygarde, was it?—really has its\nguard up.[VAR 0114(0011)]
So that’s the Pokémon from the rumors...[VAR 0114(0012)]
Dang, this is getting really interesting now![VAR 0114(0013)]
Lysandre! It’s him!!![VAR 0114(0014)]
Alors, what an exciting turn of events![VAR 0114(0015)]
Another unforeseen development... I’m gonna\nneed to lie down after this...[VAR 0114(0016)]
Zygarde’s wish...is that this land may continue to\nknow peace and order.[VAR 0114(0019)]
I know Emma’s been hunting for Zygarde, but it\ndoesn’t seem dangerous or anything...[VAR 0114(0006)]
I know Emma’s been hunting for Zygarde, but it\ndoesn’t seem dangerous or anything...[VAR 0114(0005)]
Now a Pokémon has infiltrated our event? What\nin the world is going on?
Is it truly wise to permit a dangerous individual\nlike Lysandre to join us?
[~ 822]
Zeh!
Will you battle Zygarde?
Battle Zygarde
I need to prepare
You would truly deny Zygarde’s wish?[VAR 0114(0019)]
Zygarde’s body is comprised of entities known as\nZygarde Cells.[VAR 0114(0019)]
The more Zygarde Cells that gather, the stronger\nZygarde’s capabilities...or so I have heard.[VAR 0114(0019)]
That is Zygarde’s 50% Forme.[VAR 0114(0019)]
Zzz-aaaaaa!!!
[~ 832]
Zeh!
As best I could tell, Zygarde seemed pleased.[VAR 0114(0019)]
Now you have seen Zygarde in its 50% Forme, but\nnot yet in its ultimate one—Zygarde Complete.[VAR 0114(0019)]
I will collect the remaining Zygarde Cells, as\nZygarde has commanded me.[VAR 0114(0019)]
You must focus on becoming a Pokémon Trainer\nmighty enough to fight at Zygarde’s side![VAR 0114(0019)]
Denizens of Lumiose, please listen![VAR 0114(0019)]
The time has come for each of you to consider\nwhat it means that Zygarde came here today.[VAR 0114(0019)]
I pray that all of you find the right answer.[VAR 0114(0019)]
Alors, my dear [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0015)]
To emerge victorious from a battle against a\nsurprise challenger... You truly are exceptional![VAR 0114(0015)]
And now, it is time for the undeniably incredible\n[VAR 0100(0000)]...[VAR 0114(0015)]
and the EXCEEDINGLY incredible host of this\nterrific tournament to begin the final round![VAR 0114(0015)]
But this is not merely the final battle—it is also\nour promotion match![VAR 0114(0015)]
I hope that all of you gathered here are ready to\nwitness the riveting resolution of today’s event![VAR 0114(0015)]
[~ 847]
Alors, at long last, we get to battle one another,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0015)]
Let’s do this
I need a minute
If you are under the impression that you can\nescape from my Jacinthe zones, you are mistaken.[VAR 0114(0015)]
Promotion Match — Rank: C\nOpponent Jacinthe authenticated!
The promotion match will now begin!
The Trainer who wins will be promoted to [VAR FF00(0006)]Rank B[VAR FF00(0000)]!
What a tournament it has been—so eventful, one\nmight think it had been going on for years![VAR 0114(0015)]
Now here we are, after so many twists and turns,\nat the conclusion of this momentous event![VAR 0114(0015)]
How glad I am to have entered the Z-A Royale!\c\nIt has allowed me to cross paths with some of the\ngreatest Trainers in Lumiose, including yourself![VAR 0114(0015)]
I feel the same way
Thank you very much
You’re pretty great yourself!
Once I reach Rank A, I will make it my mission to\nbring happiness to the people of Lumiose!\c\nTo do so, I will make each and every one of them\ninto the strongest Trainer they can be—for that is\r\nmy duty as an influential socialite![VAR 0114(0015)]
Let us begin our promotion match—and the\nconclusion of Le Super-Tournoi de Jacinthe.\c\nMay it be a battle worthy of the occasion![VAR 0114(0015)]
I should stream this with a hidden camera—call it\n“Undercover at Jacinthe’s CRAZY Secret Party!”[VAR 0114(000F)]
Ya think they’ll give out goody bags?[VAR 0114(0010)]
I will use this chance to learn all I can about the\nbattle tactics of Trainers in the highest ranks![VAR 0114(0011)]
Good luck to you both...and please hurry it up.[VAR 0114(0012)]
Listen, kid, you’d better win. Maybe that’ll get\nJacinthe to stay out of our hair for a while.[VAR 0114(0013)]
The boss seems to expect great things from you.\nPlease do your best to not disappoint him.[VAR 0114(0014)]
I’d love to see you win, but either way, just get\nthis over with before anything else goes wrong...[VAR 0114(0016)]
I’ve got one word of advice for you: Win![VAR 0114(0006)]
You just have to win. End of story![VAR 0114(0005)]
Team MZ, eh? I suppose it would not hurt to\nremember that name.
There’s no way a tournament organized by Lady\nJacinthe could end in her own defeat!
[~ 874]
It is our responsibility as elites to guide the\nmasses, Clefable![VAR 0114(0015)]
[~ 876]
Your victory is confirmed!
Congratulations! Now processing your promotion.
You’ve been promoted to [VAR FF00(0006)]Rank B[VAR FF00(0000)]!
A most heartfelt congratulations on your victory![VAR 0114(0015)]
As well as your promotion.[VAR 0114(0015)]
Have a look at our audience.[VAR 0114(0015)]
Everyone looks so very pleased![VAR 0114(0015)]
I daresay we managed to convey to them the joy\nthat comes when Trainers and Pokémon with a\r\ndeep bond battle side-by-side![VAR 0114(0015)]
Please continue your efforts to protect the city of\nLumiose. Naturally, I will help however I can![VAR 0114(0015)]
As a token of my gratitude, please accept this\nsuper-deluxe TM.[VAR 0114(0015)]
And finally, let us end this sensational soirée with\na special fist bump, as a gesture of goodwill.[VAR 0114(0015)]
Now then, let us give another heartfelt round of\napplause to [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0015)]
[~ 889]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Wow, [VAR 0100(0000)]! I can’t believe\nyou\r\nwon\r\nJacinthe’s\r\ntournament\r\nAND\r\nyour\r\npromotion\r\nmatch![VAR 0114(0006)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Wow, [VAR 0100(0000)]! I can’t believe\nyou\r\nwon\r\nJacinthe’s\r\ntournament\r\nAND\r\nyour\r\npromotion\r\nmatch![VAR 0114(0005)]
So you’re Rank B now. I’m still Rank C, but I’ll\ncatch up to you in my promotion match tomorrow![VAR 0114(0006)]
So you’re Rank B now. I’m still Rank C, but I’ll\ncatch up to you in my promotion match tomorrow![VAR 0114(0005)]
And how better to celebrate than with my\nsignature croissant curry? Let’s eat![VAR 0114(0006)]
And how better to celebrate than with my\nsignature croissant curry? Let’s eat![VAR 0114(0005)]
I thought we might all get to eat at that ritzy party,\nbut oh well! Maybe next time...[VAR 0114(000C)]
Having the same meal as always doesn’t feel very\ncelebratory...but I suppose I could have a bite.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Finally coming around to appreciating the\ndelights of croissant curry, Naveen?[VAR 0114(0006)]
Finally coming around to appreciating the\ndelights of croissant curry, Naveen?[VAR 0114(0005)]
No. But it’d be rude of me to refrain from eating\nwhen we’re celebrating.\c\nIts “delights” are, and will remain, lost on me.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Anyway—heck of a tournament, wasn’t it? I can’t\nbelieve even Zygarde showed![VAR 0114(0006)]
Anyway—heck of a tournament, wasn’t it? I can’t\nbelieve even Zygarde showed![VAR 0114(0005)]
Who’s Zygarde?[VAR 0114(000C)]
It’s a Legendary Pokémon and a total enigma!\nEmma’s been on its tail.[VAR 0114(0006)]
It’s a Legendary Pokémon and a total enigma!\nEmma’s been on its tail.[VAR 0114(0005)]
For some reason, it seems to have taken a shine\nto [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0006)]
For some reason, it seems to have taken a shine\nto [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0005)]
Oh! So that’s the Pokémon we saw after we\ncalmed down that Mega Barbaracle?\c\nSo it’s kinda strange, but it really likes you for\nsome reason? Sounds like Jacinthe![VAR 0114(000C)]
No, it has a different vibe
They’re not the same at all
We should probably ask AZ about Zygarde. He\nmight know more.[VAR 0114(0006)]
We should probably ask AZ about Zygarde. He\nmight know more.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Actually, has anyone seen Floette? She usually\nhangs out when we’re celebrating...[VAR 0114(0006)]
Actually, has anyone seen Floette? She usually\njoins in when we’re celebrating...[VAR 0114(0005)]
I saw her head up to the roof with AZ earlier.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Oh, OK. Well, let’s dig in while dinner’s still hot,\nflaky, and saucy![VAR 0114(0006)]
Oh, OK. Well, for now, let’s dig in![VAR 0114(0005)]
[~ 918]
Ange...[VAR 0114(000A)]
You were meant to be a guardian of the city,\ntowering over her and watching her always...[VAR 0114(000A)]
Kyuru...
A three-thousand-year-old desire, once foolishly\nheld...\c\nA three-thousand-year-old mistake, so very\nfoolishly made...[VAR 0114(000A)]
It even cost me you, my beloved Floette.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Now these bright young lives must pay my\nremaining debts...or Lumiose’s future will be lost.[VAR 0114(000A)]

The next day...
Your alarm is going off...
[~ 2]
Lumiose trembles...[VAR 0114(000A)]
What d’you mean, AZ?[VAR 0114(0006)]
AZ? What’s the matter?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Prism Tower...[VAR 0114(000A)]
The unease spilling from it can now be felt even\nat this distance.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Then we gotta do something about it![VAR 0114(0006)]
Then it’s time we did something about it![VAR 0114(0005)]
Not yet.[VAR 0114(000A)]
The only one who can control the tower is\nMega Floette.\c\nWe will need the strongest Mega Evolution user\nif we’re to put this situation to rights.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Wait, MEGA Floette? Wow...\c\nGuess I’ve gotta make it to the top rank of the\nZ-A Royale and prove I’m the strongest, then![VAR 0114(0006)]
Did you say “Mega” Floette?!\c\nWell, I guess I’ve got no choice but to reach the\ntop of the Z-A Royale and prove I can handle it![VAR 0114(0005)]
Yes. If you can prove that you are the strongest of\nall, then Floette may respond to your strength![VAR 0114(000A)]
Kyururu.
I know, Floette. I know.[VAR 0114(0006)]
I know, Floette. I know.[VAR 0114(0005)]
You said last night you’re still Rank C, right,\n[VAR 018B(0001)]?[VAR 0114(000C)]
That’s right![VAR 0114(0006)]
That’s right.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Then the strongest Mega Evolution user is all but\nguaranteed to be [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(000B)]
Hey, have a little faith! I’m not the leader of Team\nMZ for nothing![VAR 0114(0006)]
Hey, don’t count me out! I’m the leader of Team\nMZ, remember?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Just watch! I’ll catch up to—no, blow right past—\n[VAR 0100(0000)] in the rankings!\c\nAnd I won’t stop there—I’ll fix this whole mess!\nI’ll help so many people and Pokémon at once![VAR 0114(0006)]
Just watch! I’ll catch up to—no, climb right past—\n[VAR 0100(0000)] in the rankings!\c\nAnd then I’ll make things right in Lumiose! I’ll\nhelp so many people and Pokémon at once![VAR 0114(0005)]
That’s the spirit! It wouldn’t be fair to just leave\neverything up to [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(000C)]
I’ll be pulling for you, too, [VAR 018B(0001)]. Good luck\nclimbing the ranks.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Oh, hang on—I got a message from Vinnie.\c\nHe says I should come meet him at Quasartico.\nWonder what’s up.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Oh—I got a message from Vinnie.\c\nHe says I should come meet him at Quasartico.\nI wonder what he needs.[VAR 0114(0005)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]He asked for you to come too,\n[VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0006)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]He asked for you to come too,\n[VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0005)]
I wonder what’s in store for all of us...[VAR 0114(000C)]
I’ll do whatever it takes so I can spend the rest of\nmy days designing clothes...[VAR 0114(000B)]
Listen to the voice of the city. Reach out to aid\nthose who are crying out in sorrow.[VAR 0114(000A)]
[~ 35]
You’re both here? Good.\c\nI’m sorry for the urgent summons.[VAR 0114(000E)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]What’s going on? What’d you need both me and\n[VAR 0100(0000)]\r\nfor?[VAR 0114(0006)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]What’s the matter? What did you need me and\n[VAR 0100(0000)] for?[VAR 0114(0005)]
I’m afraid I do not have any answers—I was\nmerely tasked with reaching out to you.[VAR 0114(000E)]
President Jett is waiting inside. She will be the\none to explain.[VAR 0114(000E)]
[~ 41]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Ma’am, I’ve brought Team MZ’s leader,\n[VAR 018B(0001)],\r\nand\r\nh[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]eris\r\nteammate\r\n[VAR 0100(0000)]\r\nas well.[VAR 0114(000E)]
Thank you both for sparing me some of your time.[VAR 0114(000D)]
[VAR 018B(0001)]. [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(000D)]
The two of you helped me out of a difficult\nsituation the other day, along with that gentleman\r\nfrom the Rust Syndicate.\c\nI’m sorry I failed to properly express my\nappreciation sooner.[VAR 0114(000D)]
So...it wasn’t true, right? What that Trainer was\nsaying?[VAR 0114(0006)]
So...it wasn’t true, right? What that Trainer was\nsaying?[VAR 0114(0005)]
You mean his claim that the Pokémon flocking to\nLumiose are part of some plot by our company?\r\nOf course that’s incorrect.[VAR 0114(000D)]
Truly, the extent of our involvement in this entire\naffair is the use of our holo-tech barriers.\c\nThese barriers encircle the wild zones and keep\nwild Pokémon from damaging their surroundings.\c\nSpecifically, though, they are intended to prevent\nwild Pokémon that have undergone Rogue Mega\r\nEvolution from causing widespread damage.[VAR 0114(000D)]
Makes sense...[VAR 0114(0006)]
Makes sense...[VAR 0114(0005)]
After the incident five years ago, Lumiose City\nwas hemorrhaging people, and property values\r\nwere in free fall.\c\nThis is why the urban redevelopment plan was\nestablished.[VAR 0114(000D)]
But it was a risky venture. The mayor could not\nfind businesses willing to take on the project.\c\nAnd so it fell to my company: Quasartico Inc.[VAR 0114(000D)]
The initial plan was to create a city that belonged\nto both people and Pokémon. A place where wild\r\nPokémon could live alongside humans.[VAR 0114(000D)]
There were concerns from some uneasy with the\nidea—even those with no ties to this city. Still, it\r\nwas a noble undertaking, worth pursuing.[VAR 0114(000D)]
But when we began investigating Prism Tower to\nplan for repairs and improvements, we became\r\naware of something we had not anticipated.[VAR 0114(000D)]
The tower was emitting a peculiar energy.[VAR 0114(000D)]
That is when we also began detecting that\nstrange power—which we call Mega Power—\r\nin all corners of Lumiose City.[VAR 0114(000D)]
At the same time, wild Pokémon were flocking to\nthe city in droves, as if drawn to this power.[VAR 0114(000D)]
And now, we have Rogue Mega Evolution...\c\nIf this dire phenomenon becomes commonplace,\nthe people will abandon Lumiose once more...[VAR 0114(000D)]
It’s all right! Team MZ will help get all this under\ncontrol![VAR 0114(0006)]
Don’t worry! Team MZ will help get all this under\ncontrol![VAR 0114(0005)]
Thank you for that, young [VAR 1100(00FF,0304)]ladyman.[VAR 0114(000D)]
Beg pardon, ma’am. It seems I’m being called for.\c\nIf you would excuse me for just a moment?[VAR 0114(000E)]
It is thanks to Vinnie that I came to know of AZ.[VAR 0114(000D)]
Which also led me to your group, Team MZ...and\nto me asking so much of you children now.[VAR 0114(000D)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]As if we wouldn’t want to help save the people\nand Pokémon of Lumiose!\c\nWe’re glad to help! Right,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0006)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]As if we wouldn’t want to help save the people\nand Pokémon of Lumiose!\c\nWe’re glad to help! Right,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Yeah! We’ll protect everyone
Yeah! It’s for Lumiose’s future
Thank you both.[VAR 0114(000D)]
I wish to make this a city where people and\nPokémon truly can live together.\c\nHelp me make that dream a reality.[VAR 0114(000D)]
We’re on it!\c\nWhich probably means we better get down to\nwork. Thanks for having us.[VAR 0114(0006)]
We certainly will!\c\nWhich means we’d better get to work right away.\nThanks for having us.[VAR 0114(0005)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]One last question before you go,\n[VAR 018B(0001)].[VAR 0114(000D)]
If you don’t mind me asking—that jacket of yours.\nWhere did you obtain it?[VAR 0114(000D)]
This? It...used to be my mom’s. Something to\nremember her by.[VAR 0114(0006)]
It was my mom’s. I keep it to remember her by.[VAR 0114(0005)]
I see...\c\nForgive me. I just thought it looked familiar\nsomehow.[VAR 0114(000D)]
If you remember where you might’ve seen it, let\nme know, ma’am!\c\nI came here to Lumiose searching for someone.\nYou might just have the clue I need to find them![VAR 0114(0006)]
If you remember where you might’ve seen it,\nplease let me know, ma’am.\c\nI came here to Lumiose searching for someone.\nYour memory could be the clue I need.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Now, we should get going...[VAR 0114(0006)]
Now, if you’ll excuse us...[VAR 0114(0005)]
Please. One more moment of your time.[VAR 0114(000E)]
I’ve just been briefed about the latest readings.\nWe’re detecting concentrations of Mega Power.[VAR 0114(000E)]
I will email you all of the details, as usual.[VAR 0114(000E)]
Leave it to us! This is what Team MZ’s here for![VAR 0114(0006)]
Leave it to us! This is what Team MZ’s here for![VAR 0114(0005)]
We’re gonna make Lumiose a city that people and\nPokémon can share, like you were saying, ma’am![VAR 0114(0006)]
We’re gonna make Lumiose a city that people and\nPokémon can share, like you were saying, ma’am![VAR 0114(0005)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]C’mon, [VAR 0100(0000)]! We’re\nheading\r\nback\r\nto\r\nthe\r\nhotel.\r\nStrategy meeting time![VAR 0114(0006)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]C’mon, [VAR 0100(0000)]! We’re\nheading\r\nback\r\nto\r\nthe\r\nhotel.\r\nTime\r\nfor\r\nanother\r\nstrategy meeting![VAR 0114(0005)]
[~ 93]
So? Why’d Vinnie call you over to Quasartico?[VAR 0114(000C)]
I guess the president just wanted us to know\nthey’ve got our backs and appreciate our work.\c\nShe said she’s counting on our help to take care\nof the Rogue Mega Evolution problem.[VAR 0114(0006)]
I guess the president just wanted us to know\nthey’ve got our backs and appreciate our work.\c\nShe said she’s counting on our help to take care\nof the Rogue Mega Evolution problem.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Speaking of which, did you both get word from\nVinnie about new Rogue Mega Evolution reports?[VAR 0114(0006)]
On that note, did you both hear from Vinnie about\nRogue Mega Evolution reports for us to look into?[VAR 0114(0005)]
That we did. Which I suppose means it’s time for\nanother strategy meeting.[VAR 0114(000B)]
[~ 100]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Let’s start our strategy meeting,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(000C)]
OK, I’m ready!
Wait a sec...
Mmkay, well, let me know when you’re ready.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Let’s get the meeting started already! We’ve got\nstrategies to make![VAR 0114(0006)]
Let’s start the meeting and get strategizing![VAR 0114(0005)]
I see Rogue Mega Evolution hasn’t decided to\nease off and give us a break.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Here’s the new info from Vinnie.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Our first concern is a [VAR FF00(0006)]Dragonite[VAR FF00(0000)] in Vert Sector 3.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Second, in Jaune Sector 4, we’ve got a [VAR FF00(0006)]Tyranitar[VAR FF00(0000)]\nto check out.[VAR 0114(000C)]
And finally, there’s a [VAR FF00(0006)]Starmie[VAR FF00(0000)] in Bleu Sector 9.[VAR 0114(000C)]
All three of those can be difficult to tackle even\nwhen they HAVEN’T Mega Evolved.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Yeah—so they’re gonna be extremely tough\ncustomers when Rogue Mega Evolution sets in.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Which means they’ll be extremely tough\ncustomers when Rogue Mega Evolution sets in.[VAR 0114(0005)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Do you feel up to this,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(000C)]
Of course!
I’ve got this
Team MZ will be supporting you on the ground,\nas always.[VAR 0114(000B)]
But even with our help, these will be serious\nopponents. We can’t let our guard down.[VAR 0114(000B)]
C’mon, we’re all pros at working together now.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Sure, but think of how good we’ve gotten at\nworking together now.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Yeah! We’ve calmed so many Rogue Pokémon.\nTeam MZ is a well-oiled machine![VAR 0114(000C)]
True enough.[VAR 0114(000B)]
OK, so to recap:[VAR 0114(000C)]
We’ve got three more Pokémon at risk of Rogue\nMega Evolution.\c\nWe’ll stake out each of their locations, then\nsupport [VAR 0100(0000)] from there.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Up first—the [VAR FF00(0006)]Dragonite[VAR FF00(0000)] in Vert Sector 3! That one\ngoes to [VAR 018B(0001)].[VAR 0114(000C)]
Naveen, you go keep an eye on that [VAR FF00(0006)]Tyranitar[VAR FF00(0000)] in\nJaune Sector 4.[VAR 0114(000C)]
And I’ll stand by to help handle the [VAR FF00(0006)]Starmie[VAR FF00(0000)] in\nBleu Sector 9![VAR 0114(000C)]
We always seem to leave the heaviest load on\nyour shoulders, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(000B)]
I’m fine, really!
I can handle it
[VAR BD06(0000)]Thanks, [VAR 0100(0000)]. I’m really\nglad\r\nto\r\nhear\r\nthat.[VAR 0114(000C)]
And you can count on us to heal up your\nPokémon before we get into battle![VAR 0114(0006)]
And you can count on us to heal up your\nPokémon before we get into battle![VAR 0114(0005)]
All right, team—move out! Time to save more\nPokémon from Rogue Mega Evolution![VAR 0114(000C)]
I’m gonna save the Rogue Pokémon...and become\nthe strongest Mega Evolution user while I’m at it![VAR 0114(0006)]

You did your research, huh?
Yeah, I know its category
As you’d expect from the name, it possesses\nimpressive defenses. This may be a long fight.[VAR 0114(000B)]

For goodness’ sake...[VAR 0114(0014)]
Which imbecile let two civilians waltz in here\nwhen I specifically said to block off the area?[VAR 0114(0014)]
M-Mr. Philippe! Hi! What’re you doing here?[VAR 0114(000C)]
We received word of a Pokémon behaving\nerratically.[VAR 0114(0014)]
We cannot allow any Lumiose resident to be\nharmed, so we came to evaluate the situation.[VAR 0114(0014)]
I thought that if need be, I could...take care of the\nsituation personally.[VAR 0114(0014)]

[~ 214]
I see you’ve been honing your skills.[VAR 0114(0014)]
Time for us to withdraw, you lot. We can leave\nthings to Team MZ.[VAR 0114(0014)]
I can understand why the boss holds you in such\nhigh regard.[VAR 0114(0014)]
When I first met the boss, I thought nobody could\npossibly surpass him...\c\nYet now I find that the world may be bigger than I\never imagined.[VAR 0114(0014)]
That’s kind of funny coming from you, Philippe.\nYou’re older than Corbeau—and the rest of us![VAR 0114(000C)]
Age matters little when it comes to greatness.[VAR 0114(0014)]
In my childhood years, I was already formidable in\nphysical strength and in my talent for battles.\c\nAs such, I was able to keep the local ruffians\nunder control...and under my command.[VAR 0114(0014)]
But I was still nothing but a young fool. I was\nstrong, yes, but that didn’t put food on the table.\c\nIt was only thanks to Lysandre’s support that I\nmanaged to survive those days.[VAR 0114(0014)]
That wasn’t the case for Mr. Corbeau.[VAR 0114(0014)]
He negotiated with Lysandre, convincing the man\nto give him seed money for his ventures.\c\nMr. Corbeau started up all sorts of businesses—\nsecurity services, Pokémon couriers, even some\r\nthings that perhaps weren’t entirely aboveboard.[VAR 0114(0014)]
He was quite the little upstart. So me and my\ngang thought he needed to be taught a lesson.\c\nYet young Mr. Corbeau and his partner Venipede\ngave us the slip at every turn, always one step\r\nahead, until we were forced to admit defeat.[VAR 0114(0014)]
He outdid us completely—and in an area entirely\nunrelated to Pokémon battles.\c\nEver since then, he has been the only person I call\nmy boss.[VAR 0114(0014)]
Hm... Maybe I shouldn’t have told you all that.\nIn exchange for your silence, please take this.[VAR 0114(0014)]
This is...a Water Stone, right?[VAR 0114(000C)]
Use it on that partner of yours. It will surely help\nyou protect Lumiose.[VAR 0114(0014)]
Now, please make sure to handle things here. If\nthis city goes down, the Rust Syndicate will have\r\nno clients left to work with, after all.[VAR 0114(0014)]
If I use the stone Philippe gave me, it’ll be Starmie\nversus Starmie... Think I should do it?[VAR 0114(000C)]
Sure, why not?
Well, it WAS a gift
Right... Yeah, OK.\c\nI’ll evolve my partner. Then we’ve got to go calm\nthat Rogue Mega Starmie![VAR 0114(000C)]

I can give you the information you need, but this\nknowledge could potentially put you in danger.\r\nDo you still want to know?[VAR 0114(0008)]
Of course we still do!

Tell me, what do you two know about Team Flare?[VAR 0114(0008)]
They’re the group that caused a ton of trouble for\nKalos five years ago...right?[VAR 0114(0006)]
They’re the group that caused all that trouble for\nKalos five years ago...right?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Exactly right. Their group was led by a man\nnamed Lysandre.[VAR 0114(0008)]
He disappeared five years ago, but now he’s\nreappeared, calling himself “L.”[VAR 0114(0008)]
He’s been spotted around town with a mysterious\nPokémon. It seemed suspicious, so I decided to\r\ninvestigate them—not for a client, just for me.[VAR 0114(0008)]
But everything I’ve uncovered tells me that L\nhasn’t been doing anything sinister at all.\c\nIn fact, he seems to be genuinely trying to help\nsave Lumiose. So it’s not the old guard we’ve got\r\nto worry about here, but rather the new...[VAR 0114(0008)]
See, about five years ago, I had my own ties to\nsomeone who was involved in Team Flare.\c\nThat’s how I heard what I’m about to tell you.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Before Team Flare collapsed, they started making\nmoves to ensure they left a legacy.\c\nApparently they tried a few different things—\nincluding making the Expansion Suit that I use.\c\nAnother one of their efforts involved training up a\nnew generation to carry on their ideals.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Grisham was one of the young Trainers that Team\nFlare taught.\c\nThough it’s not clear if “Grisham” is even a real\nname or not...[VAR 0114(0008)]
And now it seems Grisham is taking part in the\nZ-A Royale, but why? To what end?[VAR 0114(0008)]
Could it still be for Team Flare?
Does Grisham have a goal of their own?
There’s no real saying for sure. Not until I do\nsome more digging, at least.[VAR 0114(0008)]
You know what? I bet Mable at the Pokémon\nResearch Lab could tell you more about Grisham.[VAR 0114(0008)]
You mean Mable knows Grisham?
Why would she know anything?
Sorry, but that’s not for me to say—it’s up to\nMable to decide how much she wants to share.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Thanks for the tip, Emma.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Thanks for the tip, Emma.[VAR 0114(0005)]
I’ll do some investigating of my own. You should\ngo to the Pokémon Research Lab and see what\r\nMable says, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0006)]
I’ll do some investigating of my own. You should\ngo to the Pokémon Research Lab and see what\r\nMable says, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0005)]
You should visit the Pokémon Research Lab if you\nwant to know more![VAR 0114(0008)]
[~ 368]
That rat! That vile little man![VAR 0114(0007)]
I can’t believe that mayor! It’s not my fault we\nkeep getting more wild zones![VAR 0114(0007)]
And it’s not even like I can tell him off. Not when\nhe knows I’m basically at his mercy...[VAR 0114(0007)]
But that doesn’t mean I should get worked into\nthe ground! I’m acting director of this place![VAR 0114(0007)]
[~ 373]
Are you making progress on my research tasks?[VAR 0114(0007)]
I want to know about Grisham
Grisham? Who could that be?[VAR 0114(0007)]
Someone who was in Team Flare
Someone in the Z-A Royale
Team Flare? It seems you already know more\nabout Gris than I would’ve thought...[VAR 0114(0007)]
The Z-A Royale, huh? Seems you already know\nmore about Gris than I would’ve thought...[VAR 0114(0007)]
Fine. So I used to be a part of Team Flare.[VAR 0114(0007)]
Wait, seriously?
Tell me more!
I don’t really mind telling people, if they’re merely\ncurious.\c\nBut there are still people today who react badly if\nthey even hear the words “Team Flare,” you know?[VAR 0114(0007)]
So I don’t exactly walk around advertising it, but I\nwon’t lie about it if I’m asked either.[VAR 0114(0007)]
When everything fell apart, I got taken into\ncustody along with the others.\c\nBut I took a plea deal.[VAR 0114(0007)]
So I got made acting director of this lab. Easy to\nkeep tabs on me if I’m always stuck here, right?\c\nMy role in Team Flare also had me looking into\nPokémon energy and all, so I don’t hate the work.[VAR 0114(0007)]
Sorry, sorry, didn’t mean for the sob story to spill\nout. You want to know about Grisham, huh?[VAR 0114(0007)]
He was a part of the younger generation in Team\nFlare. Everyone called him “Gris.” It means “gray”...\r\nlike the color of ashes.[VAR 0114(0007)]
He was pretty strong when it came to Pokémon\nbattles. Not that he got much chance to show off\r\nthat skill at the time.[VAR 0114(0007)]
I honestly don’t know what he might be thinking\nnow, joining the Z-A Royale.[VAR 0114(0007)]
But if you’ve really got to know, you might want\nto try Nouveau Café over in Centrico Plaza.[VAR 0114(0007)]
What’s at Nouveau Café?
The coffee truck? Why?
You’ll find out when you go, won’t you? Sheesh,\nkid, don’t take all the mystery and fun out of life![VAR 0114(0007)]
You’re about to walk into a pretty sticky situation,\nbut I’ll be there to help you when the time comes.\c\nAnd don’t forget...[VAR 0114(0007)]
I still want you to keep up the research work, too.[VAR 0114(0007)]
[~ 398]
The only good thing we’ve got to offer is our\nlocation. You here for another nasty drink?
If you’d like to order something, please speak to\nthe young lady there.
I’d like to order a meeting with Grisham
I’d like to order one promotion match
Well, isn’t this entertaining!
It looks like you’ve managed to find your next\nopponent!
The quiet master of Centrico Plaza’s famed\nNouveau Café truck is indeed just a front.
The truth is, I’m one of the top-ranked Trainers in\nthe Z-A Royale, the foremost Trainer in Rank B...
and the boss of [VAR FF00(0006)]Team Flare Nouveau[VAR FF00(0000)].
Yes, you found me. [VAR FF00(0006)]Grisham [VAR FF00(0000)]at your service.[VAR 0114(0017)]
I’ve got my own goals to achieve—goals that have\nbrought me to the Z-A Royale.[VAR 0114(0017)]
Which is why I cannot let you defeat me.[VAR 0114(0017)]
I suppose this still makes little sense to you,\nhowever. Shall I explain the whole thing?[VAR 0114(0017)]
Grisham, you know this kid is with AZ.
There’s no point even trying to explain it all to\nsomeone on AZ’s side!
This is Griselle, one of my comrades in Team Flare\nNouveau.[VAR 0114(0017)]
Let’s just take this kid down! Right here, right\nnow, while we’ve got the chance![VAR 0114(0018)]
Griselle, please do calm yourself.[VAR 0114(0017)]
Nouveau Café is here to offer comfort to the\nmasses. It’s no place to start a commotion.[VAR 0114(0017)]
Fine! I sent you a location. If you care at all about\nknowing the truth, go there and wait.[VAR 0114(0018)]
We’ll close up shop, then head over.[VAR 0114(0018)]
If you’d be so kind, please check your map and\nfind your own way. We’ll meet you there.[VAR 0114(0017)]
[~ 421]
Look at you, waiting like a good little [VAR 1100(00FF,0403)]boygirl.[VAR 0114(0018)]
I imagine you must be asking yourself why we\nwould want to meet at such a spot.[VAR 0114(0017)]
This is Lysandre Café.[VAR 0114(0017)]
It was a very important place for anyone in Team\nFlare...though now it is an empty storefront.[VAR 0114(0017)]
No one has any desire to rent a location so closely\nassociated with such a disreputable group.[VAR 0114(0017)]
And since no one wants it, we’ve taken the liberty\nof continuing to use it as a base for Team Flare...\r\nor more rightly, for Team Flare Nouveau.[VAR 0114(0017)]
You do know about Team Flare, don’t you?[VAR 0114(0017)]
Of course I do
Not really...
What could an outsider like you know about what\nTeam Flare really was![VAR 0114(0018)]
You don’t even know? Of course you don’t.\nHow could someone like you ever understand...[VAR 0114(0018)]
Griselle.[VAR 0114(0017)]
Grisham, this kid is our ENEMY.\c\n[VAR 1100(00FF,0201)]HShe’s nothing but an obstacle to all the goals we\nhope to achieve for Team Flare Nouveau.[VAR 0114(0018)]
There’s no point in trying to explain everything to\nsomeone like this. Let’s just get rid of h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]imer![VAR 0114(0018)]
The world has not been kind or forgiving toward\nthose of us who were a part of Team Flare.\c\nI’m afraid it’s all too understandable—sad though\nit is—that some harden their hearts in response,\r\nlike Griselle here has done.[VAR 0114(0017)]
My apologies.\c\nI’m afraid there’s simply no stopping Griselle\nonce she is set on a course of action.[VAR 0114(0017)]
Though it will mean revealing your battle tactics\nto me before our promotion match, I must ask...[VAR 0114(0017)]
Please. Won’t you grant Griselle the battle she\ndesires?[VAR 0114(0017)]
[~ 440]
Fight me.[VAR 0114(0018)]
I will, and I’ll win!
I don’t want to fight
Then what is the point of you even being here?[VAR 0114(0018)]
I’m going to burn you to the ground! There won’t\nbe enough of you left to fight in the Z-A Royale![VAR 0114(0018)]
[~ 446]
I’ve got to win this battle! We can’t let anyone\nstand in our way![VAR 0114(0018)]
[~ 448]
I...lost...\c\nMy Pokémon...lost...[VAR 0114(0018)]
That was well fought.[VAR 0114(0017)]
I expected nothing less from Team MZ’s new ace,\nthe one who seeks to save Lumiose City.[VAR 0114(0017)]
I’d say it’s time for a little coffee break.[VAR 0114(0017)]
Voilà! One Ember Roast, our signature drink at\nNouveau Café.[VAR 0114(0018)]
That should have perked up the Pokémon who\nbattled for us, as well.[VAR 0114(0018)]
Now that we’re all feeling refreshed, allow me to\nteach you about the true history of Team Flare...\r\nand what it is we hope to accomplish.[VAR 0114(0017)]
Please join us inside.[VAR 0114(0017)]
[~ 457]
The fiery red of Lysandre’s burning passion.[VAR 0114(0017)]
That is what fills this Lysandre Café.[VAR 0114(0017)]
And here, in this place, I’d like to explain to you\nwhy I chose to battle in the Z-A Royale.[VAR 0114(0017)]
Shall we begin with Team Flare?[VAR 0114(0017)]
You see, the group known as Team Flare provided\na place for people to come together and help one\r\nanother, all to achieve a more beautiful world.[VAR 0114(0017)]
However, our leader—a man named Lysandre—\ngrew disillusioned with humanity over time.\c\nFearing what the future might bring, he set his\nsights on a new goal of his own: to reduce the\r\nnumber of people in the world.[VAR 0114(0017)]
In the end, Lysandre made a truly foolish choice.\nHe chose to use the ultimate weapon.[VAR 0114(0017)]
Do you know about the ultimate weapon, which\nnearly burned the Kalos region off the map?[VAR 0114(0017)]
That weapon was AZ’s creation![VAR 0114(0017)]
You may only see AZ as the kindly figure who has\nprovided you with a place to call home.\c\nBut if he had never built something so horrifying\nas that ultimate weapon...[VAR 0114(0017)]
then Lysandre would have never been driven to\nsuch madness!\c\nAnd we in Team Flare wouldn’t have become\nsociety’s outcasts![VAR 0114(0017)]
And now it appears AZ is out to “save” Lumiose,\nrelying on the support of your Team MZ...\c\nHonestly, it’s laughable![VAR 0114(0017)]
My apologies. I imagine you don’t know how to\nrespond to such an unexpected outpouring.[VAR 0114(0017)]
And of course you might not even believe a word\nthat I’ve said.[VAR 0114(0017)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]That is why I invite you,\n[VAR 0100(0000)],\r\nto\r\nwitness\r\nthe\r\ntruth\r\nyourself.[VAR 0114(0017)]
How’s that?
The truth?
You’ll see.[VAR 0114(0017)]
Grisham goes to the hidden door and gives the\npassword...
Open sesame![VAR 0114(0017)]
The hidden door opened!
Beyond that door lies the former Lysandre Labs.[VAR 0114(0017)]
It was a facility used for research in the days\nwhen Team Flare was still active.[VAR 0114(0017)]
And it was down there that we learned AZ’s\nsecrets for ourselves.[VAR 0114(0017)]
That is where we learned of the terrible weapon\nthat AZ created![VAR 0114(0017)]
You must see the truth with your own eyes, if you\nare to fully understand how awful it is.[VAR 0114(0017)]
Lysandre Labs was designed to be labyrinthine.[VAR 0114(0018)]
And of course plenty of wild Pokémon have taken\nover the place since it was abandoned.[VAR 0114(0018)]
You might be done in before you ever get to see\nthe truth for yourself.[VAR 0114(0018)]
Take care down there.[VAR 0114(0017)]
Don’t expect a hot cup of coffee or anything, even\nif you do manage to make it back up alive.[VAR 0114(0018)]
[~ 489]
I figured enough time had passed for you to have\ngotten yourself in some trouble.\c\nLet me guess: You’re down in Lysandre Labs?[VAR 0114(0007)]
If so, there should be an elevator right in front of\nyou. See it?\c\nYou’ll need to find an Elevator Key. There should\nbe one lying around there somewhere.[VAR 0114(0007)]
You can’t get through.
[~ 493]
You pulled down the lever and activated the\npower supply unit!
The lights are back on, and nearby warp panels\nshould work now!
This warp panel doesn’t seem to be powered.\c\nYou’ll have to find the right power supply unit to\nget it up and running again.

You obtained Lab Key Card A!\c\nYou should now be able to open the door with the\nconsole labeled “A”!

“The Device That Grants Life.”\c\nThis device was created three thousand years in\nthe past.\c\nIt was originally designed to restore life to a\nPokémon that had perished.\c\nWe have found this ultimate weapon buried in\nthe earth beneath Geosenge Town.\c\nIt has been well preserved. We believe we can\nhave it operational with a little work.\c\nBut we have not yet found the necessary key to\nactivate the weapon.\c\nWe believe AZ should still possess it, since he\nwas the machine’s creator.\c\nWe must find him and capture him—without\ndelay.
The “Device That Grants Life” in fact grants the\ndeceased [VAR FF00(0006)]life stolen from other Pokémon[VAR FF00(0000)].\c\nThis is because the basic function of the device\nis to distill energy into its purest form, then emit\r\nthat distilled energy.\c\nThis emission can take the form of convection,\nradiation, or conduction.\c\nThus life can be conducted back into a Pokémon\nthat had lost its own, allowing it to be revived.\c\nWhat, then, would occur if we were to fuel the\ndevice with the energy of a Legendary Pokémon?
Kalos is said to have two Legendary Pokémon.\c\nXerneas—which represents life and rebirth.\c\nAnd Yveltal—representing destruction and death.\c\nThe power to grant life and the power to steal life.\c\nThese are mysterious abilities that even science\nhas not been able to decode.\c\nWhat would happen to the world if we were to\nuse such power to activate the ultimate weapon?
As the world grows wealthier, the number of\nPokémon and people will only continue to grow,\r\nand that growth will invite new difficulties.\c\nIn time, life will fill every corner of the planet,\nuntil no more life can be sustained.\c\nWhen there is only one of something, it cannot be\nshared.\c\nWhen something cannot be shared, it will be\nfought over.\c\nAnd when something is fought over, some must\nsurvive without it.\c\nThe only way to create a world where people live\nin beauty, a world without conflict or theft, is to\r\nreduce the number of living things.\c\nMy comrades in Team Flare, the time has come to\nlead the world toward a more beautiful future.
Zeh!
Have you learned the secret of the ultimate\nweapon? How truly abominable it was?[VAR 0114(0004)]
AZ created that weapon.\c\nThen, one thousand years later, he also made a\n[VAR FF00(0006)]device[VAR FF00(0000)] that now dwells within Prism Tower.[VAR 0114(0019)]
L?! But how?
Why’re you here?
Zygarde seemed to wish that I come to this place.[VAR 0114(0019)]
I have lost most of my memories, and yet...this\nplace does bring back something.[VAR 0114(0019)]
What I remember most clearly...is AZ.[VAR 0114(0019)]
When I spoke with him five years ago, through\nthe bars of his cell, I did not know his true intent.\c\nBut I did learn of the device within Prism Tower.[VAR 0114(0019)]
I set my mind on activating both the ultimate\nweapon and that device.[VAR 0114(0019)]
But to activate the device required a certain\nPokémon—one particular Floette.\c\nAnd there was no way to know where that Floette\ncould be found.[VAR 0114(0019)]
That led me to abandon my plans for the tower’s\ndevice.\c\nBut the ultimate weapon could still be activated\nusing the key AZ carried. And so I did...[VAR 0114(0019)]
There was an explosion—I remember that much,\nthough I cannot recall the cause of it.\c\nPerhaps the weapon was incomplete...\c\nI was buried deep in the earth, together with\nTeam Flare’s secret base.[VAR 0114(0019)]
But you’re still alive
But you’re right here
Zygarde saved me.[VAR 0114(0019)]
It worked to protect all living creatures in the area\nfrom the light raining down—the deadly light of\r\nthe ultimate weapon.\c\nIn doing so, Zygarde exhausted its own power.[VAR 0114(0019)]
But at the weapon’s activation, the device in\nPrism Tower awakened as well, sensing danger.\c\nNow it has become a threat to Lumiose. It could\nfully lose control at any time.\c\nTo stop the device and protect this city, Zygarde\nmust regain its true power.[VAR 0114(0019)]
It has given me a mission.[VAR 0114(0019)]
Sooner or later, the tower will enter a frenzied\nstate similar to Rogue Mega Evolution.[VAR 0114(0019)]
The only one who can bring it back under control\nis AZ’s Floette.\c\nYes, we need the [VAR FF00(0006)]Eternal Flower[VAR FF00(0000)]...and a Trainer\nwho can draw forth her full power.[VAR 0114(0019)]
This is the truth I know. And now you have\nlearned all that those young people waiting in\r\nLysandre Café wanted you to learn.[VAR 0114(0019)]
Go and speak with Grisham and with AZ. Then do\nwhat must be done.[VAR 0114(0019)]
[~ 577]
Did you see Lysandre?[VAR 0114(0017)]
I met him inside
He’s still down there
To think that he is still alive...\c\nAnd yet he doesn’t seem to remember us in the\nslightest.[VAR 0114(0017)]
How could he just forget?! It’s—it’s all because of\nhim that the rest of us—![VAR 0114(0018)]
Griselle. There will be a time for such things later.[VAR 0114(0017)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]And you, [VAR 0100(0000)]. You now\nknow\r\nthe\r\ntruth\r\nof\r\nAZ’s\r\nsins.[VAR 0114(0017)]
And so I make this request of you:[VAR 0114(0017)]
Get AZ’s Floette and give her to me.[VAR 0114(0017)]
Why would I do a thing like that?
What about what Floette wants?
You must see it by now! With AZ’s special Floette,\nwe should be able to keep Prism Tower controlled.\c\nEverything we’ve learned points to that\nconclusion![VAR 0114(0017)]
We must stop the tower from going on a rampage\nif we’re ever to achieve the kind of beautiful world\r\nTeam Flare once dreamed of.[VAR 0114(0017)]
And if WE can be the ones to protect Lumiose,\nthen people will finally see us differently![VAR 0114(0018)]
Do you understand?\c\nWe were mere children, born to those who chose\nto join Team Flare.\c\nAnd yet we too became pariahs in the eyes of\nsociety when Team Flare was disbanded.[VAR 0114(0017)]
But we couldn’t just leave Lumiose!\c\nThis city is our home too, and we love it as much\nas anyone else!\c\nThe only reason Team Flare existed was to make\nLumiose better! To make all of Kalos better![VAR 0114(0018)]
At Nouveau Café, we’ve worked hard to provide\ncoffee to those who have little else...\c\nAnd as we’ve worked there, we’ve also heard the\nvoices of Lumiose’s people.\c\nWe understand this city better than anyone else.\nWe know its people better than anyone else.[VAR 0114(0017)]
So if you really want to face me in battle, you’ll\nneed more than just a Challenger’s Ticket.[VAR 0114(0017)]
You’ll need to be ready to hand over AZ’s Floette\nto me.[VAR 0114(0017)]
I must become the strongest Pokémon Trainer by\nbattling my way up through the Z-A Royale. I must\r\nbecome the strongest Mega Evolution user.[VAR 0114(0017)]
Then I will be the one to restrain Prism Tower\nwith AZ’s Floette![VAR 0114(0017)]
Go talk with the rest of Team MZ and decide what\nit is you really ought to do.[VAR 0114(0018)]
It’s time they all learned of AZ’s sins.[VAR 0114(0017)]
Now, go back to Hotel Z.[VAR 0114(0017)]
Go back to Hotel Z and bring me that Floette.[VAR 0114(0017)]
I’ll give you endless coffee on the house—just let\nGrisham be the one to save us this time.[VAR 0114(0018)]
Grisham is going to be the one to come out on\ntop in the Z-A Royale!\c\nIt’ll be Team Flare Nouveau who saves Lumiose\nthis time![VAR 0114(0018)]
But I guess we still need to make a living. Fine...[VAR 0114(0018)]
[~ 606]
You’ve returned.[VAR 0114(000A)]
I heard from Emma what leads you were following\nup on.\c\nI imagine you’ve learned much of my tale by now.\nIsn’t that right?[VAR 0114(000A)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Oh! Hey, [VAR 0100(0000)]. Did you\nmanage\r\nto\r\nfind\r\nGrisham?[VAR 0114(0006)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Oh, [VAR 0100(0000)]! Did you\nmanage\r\nto\r\nfind\r\nGrisham?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Oh, I found him, all right
He’s the guy from the café
No kidding! I went digging into the rumors about\nGrisham with Emma after our chat. Seems he’s\r\none formidable Trainer.[VAR 0114(0006)]
No kidding! I went digging into the rumors about\nGrisham with Emma after our chat. Sounds like\r\nhe’s one formidable Trainer.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Plus, he’s part of this group, Team Flare Nouveau,\nand he’s been gathering all sorts of info about\r\nLumiose from customers at Nouveau Café.\c\nHe even seems to know something weird’s going\non with Prism Tower![VAR 0114(0006)]
Plus, he’s part of this group, Team Flare Nouveau,\nand he’s been gathering all sorts of info about\r\nLumiose from customers at Nouveau Café.\c\nHe even seems to know something weird’s going\non with Prism Tower![VAR 0114(0005)]
AZ... Is there any chance you could tell us more\nabout the tower, given the situation?[VAR 0114(0006)]
AZ... Is there any chance you could tell us more\nabout the tower, given the situation?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Yes. I’ve also been thinking it is time I talked to\nyou all about it.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Come. We can speak on the roof.[VAR 0114(000A)]
[~ 621]
[VAR BD06(0000)][VAR 0100(0000)]. You know of the\nultimate\r\nweapon,\r\ndon’t\r\nyou?[VAR 0114(000A)]
Yes, I know the truth now
I went to Lysandre Labs
Then I shall tell you of the terrible sins I have\ncommitted...and of my regrets.[VAR 0114(000A)]
In the war that occurred three thousand years\nago, many things were lost.[VAR 0114(000A)]
So many Pokémon had their futures stolen...\nPeople lost the everyday lives they’d known...[VAR 0114(000A)]
And my Floette was sent to the front lines...where\nshe lost her life.[VAR 0114(000A)]
I made a device—a machine that could grant life.\nAll so that I could revive my beloved Floette.[VAR 0114(000A)]
I brought Floette back to life. I got back what I\nhad loved most.[VAR 0114(000A)]
But my rage had not subsided.\c\nI could not forgive the world that had hurt the\nPokémon that I loved.[VAR 0114(000A)]
In my rage, I remade my device into the ultimate\nweapon.[VAR 0114(000A)]
I put an end to the senseless conflict that would\nhave taken everything from us.\c\nBy becoming destruction itself.[VAR 0114(000A)]
The light fired from the ultimate weapon reached\nthe heavens, then poured down, burning away all\r\nthat rested upon the earth.[VAR 0114(000A)]
But Floette must have known the truth...\c\nShe must have realized that the life I had given\nher was stolen from so many other Pokémon.[VAR 0114(000A)]
She left me. And I wandered alone for three\nthousand years.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Kyururu...
Seriously? For three thousand whole years?[VAR 0114(000C)]
During those long years of aimless wandering, a\nman of great power asked me for my help. He said\r\nhe wanted a way to protect Kalos.[VAR 0114(000A)]
At this, I thought to myself...\c\nI cannot make another device that would take\nfrom others.\c\nBut perhaps I could make one that would share\nthe eternal life I had bestowed on Floette.[VAR 0114(000A)]
That is what [VAR FF00(0006)]Ange[VAR FF00(0000)] is.\c\nThat is what is hidden deep within Prism Tower.[VAR 0114(000A)]
I built Ange to give meaning to the eternal life I\nhad burdened Floette with. It was, in one sense,\r\nmy attempt to atone to Floette for what I’d done.[VAR 0114(000A)]
I dreamed of the day when I could use Ange after\nreuniting with Floette at last.\c\nThat day did not come to pass. But that was\nbecause we were living in a time of peace.[VAR 0114(000A)]
But now Ange...\c\nThe tower is emitting excessive amounts of Mega\nPower, even without Mega Floette present.[VAR 0114(000A)]
This is only conjecture on my part, but I believe it\nmay be related to the ultimate weapon being fired\r\nfive years ago.\c\nThat shock awoke Ange and has caused the Mega\nPower contained within it to spill forth.[VAR 0114(000A)]
It has led to this rampant Rogue Mega Evolution.\nThe Pokémon suffer. The people come to harm.\c\nThere is only one way to put an end to the pain.\nA Mega Evolution user must Mega Evolve Floette\r\nand together reach the control panel within Ange.[VAR 0114(000A)]
I never could’ve imagined that you and Floette\nhad that kind of history... And the tower, too...[VAR 0114(0006)]
I never could’ve imagined that you and Floette\nhad that kind of history... And the tower, too...[VAR 0114(0005)]
So we need the strongest Mega Evolution user...\nto stop the tower from going berserk?[VAR 0114(0006)]
So we need the strongest Mega Evolution user...\nto stop the tower from going berserk?[VAR 0114(0005)]
I have a question—why would Floette be able to\nMega Evolve at all?\c\nNormally Pokémon can only Mega Evolve when\nthey aren’t capable of evolving any further...\c\nShouldn’t Floette be able to evolve into Florges?[VAR 0114(000B)]
My Floette cannot evolve...\c\nPerhaps because she is such a special Pokémon,\nhaving received the lives of so many others...\r\nThough that is only my conjecture.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Floette returning to my side again after three\nthousand years was an act of forgiveness.[VAR 0114(000A)]
But she likely also returned to me so that I could\natone for my sins by stopping the tower.\c\nHowever, I no longer have it in me to do battle as\na Trainer...[VAR 0114(000A)]
I mean...yeah, I guess you might’ve kicked all\nthese events into motion, AZ...\c\nbut I’m sure you never dreamed the tower would\ngo berserk like this.[VAR 0114(0006)]
I mean...yeah, I guess you might’ve kicked all\nthese events into motion, AZ...\c\nbut I’m sure you never dreamed the tower would\ngo berserk like this.[VAR 0114(0005)]
That doesn’t matter! AZ still made this awful\nmess, and Team MZ is stuck cleaning it up.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Naveen![VAR 0114(000C)]
I appreciate that AZ is trying to right his wrongs,\nand I owe him as much as any of us do.\c\nI don’t want to be the bad guy any more than the\nrest of you, but accountability matters!\c\nYou do realize we might die trying to fix all this,\ndon’t you?![VAR 0114(000B)]
Naveen is correct in what he says.\c\nI continue to cause you children nothing but\ntrouble because of my own powerlessness.[VAR 0114(000A)]
I am truly sorry...[VAR 0114(000A)]
I hear you, AZ! Just leave this to Team MZ![VAR 0114(0006)]
I understand, AZ! Just leave this to Team MZ![VAR 0114(0005)]
[VAR 0100(0000)].\c\nIt’s up to us to keep the tower from going wild.\nThat means you’ve gotta go beat Grisham![VAR 0114(0006)]
[VAR 0100(0000)].\c\nIt’s up to us to keep the tower from going wild.\nAnd that means you’ve got to beat Grisham![VAR 0114(0005)]
I’ll win for sure
I’m conflicted
How come?[VAR 0114(0006)]
How come?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Tell them about Grisham’s history
Tell them more about Team Flare Nouveau
Yeah... I see what you mean. But does that really\nmean you want to just bow out of this fight?[VAR 0114(0006)]
Ah...yeah, I see why you’d hesitate.\c\nStill, though...as rough as that is, can you afford\nto give up now?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Besides—even if you backed down and left\neverything up to Grisham, how do you know\r\nFloette would choose to fight alongside him?\c\nAnd would that bring AZ any peace?[VAR 0114(0006)]
Besides—even if you backed down and left\neverything up to Grisham, how do you know\r\nFloette would choose to fight alongside him?\c\nAnd would that bring AZ any peace?[VAR 0114(0005)]
I get why you’re conflicted. But I say you should\nface Grisham and let the battle decide things![VAR 0114(0006)]
I understand feeling conflicted, but I think you\nshould face Grisham! Let the outcome of your\r\nbattle decide things![VAR 0114(0005)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Knew we could count on you,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nWhatever Grisham’s and Team Flare Nouveau’s\ndeal is, it won’t stop us from stopping the tower![VAR 0114(0006)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Knew we could count on you,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nWe’ll be the ones to stop the tower—not Grisham\nand Team Flare Nouveau![VAR 0114(0005)]
Now it’s time to go see Grisham about your\npromotion match![VAR 0114(0006)]
All right! It’s time you go challenge Grisham to a\npromotion match![VAR 0114(0005)]
Now go earn a Challenger’s Ticket so you can\nchallenge Grisham to a promotion match![VAR 0114(0006)]
Now go earn a Challenger’s Ticket so you can\nchallenge Grisham to a promotion match![VAR 0114(0005)]
Thank you...\c\nI will forever be grateful for meeting you all, my\ndear Team MZ.[VAR 0114(000A)]
I don’t really know what the right call is here. I\nnever knew much about Team Flare...[VAR 0114(000C)]
I wonder... Do you think that Grisham truly does\nwant to protect Lumiose?[VAR 0114(000B)]
[~ 687]
I wish for Floette to be convinced that I am the\nbetter Trainer, once she sees me defeat you.\c\nHurry and get yourself a Challenger’s Ticket.[VAR 0114(0017)]
Did you arrive at an answer together with your\nfellows in Team MZ?[VAR 0114(0017)]
Yes—I’ll battle you!
I’m still not sure...
Grisham’s not the type of Trainer you’re going to\nbe able to beat if your heart’s not in it.[VAR 0114(0018)]
Honestly, why has Team MZ been trying so hard\nto reach the top of the Z-A Royale anyway?[VAR 0114(0018)]
We’re fighting for AZ
We’re fighting for Floette
Yeah, we know all about the old man and that\nblack-flower Floette of his.\c\nSo all you idiots hope to achieve is helping AZ tidy\naway the mess HE made for everyone?[VAR 0114(0018)]
Griselle, please. That’s too far.[VAR 0114(0017)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]But it is true that you, [VAR 0100(0000)],\ndon’t\r\nhave\r\nany\r\nreal\r\nties\r\nto\r\nthis\r\ncity.[VAR 0114(0017)]
What reason does some outsider like you have to\nwant to protect Lumiose?[VAR 0114(0017)]
I care about the Pokémon
I care about the people here
I’ve come to love this city
That’s good. I’m glad you also have something\nyou wish to fight for.[VAR 0114(0017)]
But it still pales before my own desire to emerge\nvictorious from this battle![VAR 0114(0017)]
I will become the greatest Trainer and use AZ’s\nFloette to protect this city from the tower.[VAR 0114(0017)]
And I will restore honor to the memory of Team\nFlare and all who have ever had their names tied\r\nto it. I will make our dream into reality at last![VAR 0114(0017)]
That is why I must defeat you! No more delays—\nlet’s finish this![VAR 0114(0017)]
Promotion Match — Rank: B\nOpponent Grisham authenticated!
The promotion match will now begin!
The Trainer who wins will be promoted to [VAR FF00(0006)]Rank A[VAR FF00(0000)].
Your resolve is nothing compared to my own.\nYou carry nothing like the burdens that I carry.\r\nAnd yet you think you’ll be able to save Lumiose.[VAR 0114(0017)]
I’ll show you my resolve
I WILL protect Lumiose
I’ll free you from your past
May the flames of Team Flare rage strong and\ntrue...and burn away all our shame and regrets![VAR 0114(0017)]
Charizard! One piping-hot battle to go![VAR 0114(0017)]
Charizard! Let your dark flames pour forth![VAR 0114(0017)]
[~ 718]
My wasted youth, nothing but ash and ruin...\nMega Evolve and burn it all away, Charizard![VAR 0114(0017)]
[~ 720]
Your victory is confirmed!
Congratulations! Now processing your promotion.
You’ve been promoted to [VAR FF00(0006)]Rank A[VAR FF00(0000)]!
You lost...but Charizard and the rest of your team\nlooked happy in that battle, Grisham.[VAR 0114(0018)]
If only we could leave behind the name of Team\nFlare... Leave behind Lumiose itself...\c\nWe’d free ourselves of such a heavy burden.[VAR 0114(0017)]
But Team Flare and the dreams that Lysandre\nhoped to make real...[VAR 0114(0017)]
That world of beauty and that sense of justice still\nhave hold of us. And they tie us to this place.[VAR 0114(0017)]
Lysandre may have gone astray, but there was\ntrue righteousness in his heart.[VAR 0114(0017)]
His ideals, the care he showed for us all... If I\nthrew them aside now, I don’t know who I’d be.[VAR 0114(0017)]
It seems you are now Lumiose’s strongest Mega\nEvolution user, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0017)]
Please take care of Prism Tower and our city.[VAR 0114(0017)]
Of course I will!
I’ll do my best
If you have need of us, we will come to your aid.\c\nAfter all, Nouveau exists in order to help others,\nso we can make the world beautiful together.[VAR 0114(0017)]
Toward that aim, let me provide you with a TM.[VAR 0114(0017)]
And come by Nouveau Café anytime. I’ll make you\none of those [VAR 01CF(0002)]s you like.[VAR 0114(0017)]
Zehhhhhh!!!
I may have been defeated...\c\nI may have been found unworthy of becoming\nZygarde’s Trainer...\c\nBut I’ll build a life that shows these things aren’t\nwhat define me.[VAR 0114(0017)]
ZEHHHD!!!
Grisham...\c\nIt seems self-serving desires crept in and\novershadowed the ideals he holds dear.[VAR 0114(0019)]
Though I, of course, am to blame for that.[VAR 0114(0019)]
Thank you for helping him to see the error of\nhis ways.[VAR 0114(0019)]
Prism Tower appears to be near its breaking point.[VAR 0114(0019)]
And unfortunately, Zygarde still lacks the last of\nthe Cells it needs to use its full strength.[VAR 0114(0019)]
When the time comes, I hope you’ll be able to\nprotect this city...\c\nOr rather—not the city itself, but every living being\nhere in Lumiose.[VAR 0114(0019)]
Zeh!
[~ 747]
Guess what?! I made it to Rank A too![VAR 0114(0006)]
Guess what?! I made it to Rank A too![VAR 0114(0005)]
Whoa! You both reached Rank A the same day?[VAR 0114(000C)]
It must’ve helped you two a lot to have strong\nteammates like each other to train with.[VAR 0114(000B)]
With two A-ranked Trainers, we’ll be able to take\ncare of the tower for sure![VAR 0114(0006)]
With two A-ranked Trainers, I know we’ll be able\nto take care of the tower![VAR 0114(0005)]
Big yes to that![VAR 0114(000C)]
I suppose that means it’s nearly time for Floette\nto help us resolve this whole situation.[VAR 0114(000B)]
I wonder who Floette will choose?[VAR 0114(000C)]
Floette? What is it? What’s wrong?![VAR 0114(000A)]
Kyururu...
Wait—Floette looks like she’s...in pain?[VAR 0114(0006)]
Wait—Floette looks like she’s...in pain![VAR 0114(0005)]
The tower...\c\nIs it Ange that is affecting you?[VAR 0114(000A)]
Kyururu.
You OK?
Floette...
Kyururu!
Looks like she’ll be OK.\c\nBut I’m sure Floette’s pretty worried, too. There’s\nno telling if we’ll really be able to stop the tower.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Looks like she’ll be OK.\c\nBut I’m sure Floette’s pretty worried, too. There’s\nno telling if we’ll really be able to stop the tower.[VAR 0114(0005)]
That’s true enough.\c\nBut we’ll never succeed if we let ourselves get too\ncaught up worrying about things going wrong![VAR 0114(000B)]
Yeah! Now’s the time to blow off steam and have\nsome fun—shake the worries off!\c\nWe’ve got some big wins to celebrate, after all![VAR 0114(000C)]
You said it![VAR 0114(0006)]
You said it![VAR 0114(0005)]
Rest easy this night.[VAR 0114(000A)]
I know that the future of Lumiose—and of this\nworld—will be safe in your hands.[VAR 0114(000A)]
[~ 774]
The door is locked. It doesn’t look like you’ll be\nable to get inside...

That night...
BOOOOOOMMM!!!
[VAR 0100(0000)]! You all right?[VAR 0114(0006)]
[VAR 0100(0000)]! You all right?[VAR 0114(0005)]
I’m gonna find out what’s happening. Meet me\nby the elevator![VAR 0114(0006)]
I’m gonna find out what’s happening. Meet me\nby the elevator![VAR 0114(0005)]
[~ 6]
Good, everyone’s OK![VAR 0114(000C)]
What even was that? An earthquake?[VAR 0114(000C)]
No, it’s something to do with Prism Tower. Looks\nlike things are taking a turn for the worse.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Canari is streaming about it now.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Let’s get to the roof. We gotta see for ourselves.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Let’s get to the roof so we can see for ourselves.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Yeah, take your time, elevator. Not like anything\nurgent’s happening.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Ugh, why is the elevator always so slow?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Normally, I’d say the slowness is part of its\njanky charm.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Here we go![VAR 0114(000C)]
Getting all four of us in this poor little elevator will\nbe a squeeze.[VAR 0114(000B)]
[~ 18]
Don’t worry. We’ve evacuated everyone who was\nin Centrico Plaza.\c\nOnce things calm down a bit, we’ll fire up the\ntruck and start handing out hot food and drinks.[VAR 0114(0018)]
[~ 20]
AZ! Floette! You’re OK![VAR 0114(000C)]
Kyururu.
We are fine. But I thank you for your concern.[VAR 0114(000A)]
What was that shaking, AZ?[VAR 0114(0006)]
What was that shaking, AZ?[VAR 0114(0005)]
You’ll recall how Floette seemed pained earlier\nthis evening.[VAR 0114(000A)]
I wondered if she might be responding to Ange\nin some way, so I came up to view the tower.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Look there.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Oh my gosh. Prism Tower...[VAR 0114(000C)]
I really don’t like the look of that glow...[VAR 0114(0006)]
This looks really bad![VAR 0114(0005)]
The time I feared has come.[VAR 0114(000A)]
It won’t be long before the tower...before Ange...\ngoes rogue as well.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Ange will go rogue?
What’ll happen?
The excessive Mega Power I spoke of before...\nThat which the tower has been emitting...[VAR 0114(000A)]
It will likely cause an explosion of Rogue Mega\nEvolution across the entire city.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Kyururu.
It’ll be all right, AZ! Team MZ’s gonna take care\nof it![VAR 0114(0006)]
Don’t worry, AZ. Team MZ’s gonna take care of it![VAR 0114(0005)]
Hey, Vinnie. This about the tower?[VAR 0114(0006)]
Hey, Vinnie. This about the tower?[VAR 0114(0005)]
It is. The situation looks dire. We need you on this\nright away.[VAR 0114(000E)]
On it. We’ll head out now.[VAR 0114(0006)]
I understand. We’ll head out now.[VAR 0114(0005)]
OK, Team MZ. Let’s regroup in Centrico Plaza![VAR 0114(0006)]
All right, Team MZ. Let’s regroup in Centrico\nPlaza![VAR 0114(0005)]
Once Floette has Mega Evolved, she can take on\nthe power of the tower—the power of Ange.\c\nThen the tower can assume the form it was\nalways intended to take: [VAR FF00(0006)]Ange Floette[VAR FF00(0000)].\c\nYou must help the tower attain its true form if\nwe are to stop it from destroying the city.\c\nI would only slow you down if I were to go, so\nI will remain here and support you from afar.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Maybe you can cook us up something good to\ncelebrate when we get back, AZ.[VAR 0114(000C)]
You wish for...me to cook?\c\nThat is a fine idea. I am familiar with so many\ndifferent cuisines.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Floette...\c\nGood luck. I am counting on you.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Kyururu.
[VAR BD06(0000)]I know you will prove yourself equal to this task,\n[VAR 0100(0000)].\r\nI\r\nam\r\nso\r\ngrateful\r\nthat\r\nour\r\npaths\r\ncrossed.[VAR 0114(000A)]
[~ 54]
It looks like we’ve got all of Team MZ here.[VAR 0114(000E)]
I’m afraid there’s no time to waste, so allow me\nto get straight to the point.[VAR 0114(000E)]
The tower is emitting more Mega Power by the\nminute.[VAR 0114(000E)]
If it keeps up this pace, the entire city will be\noverrun with Rogue Mega-Evolved Pokémon.[VAR 0114(000E)]
Kyururu!
We appreciate you joining us, Floette.[VAR 0114(000E)]
AZ has assured us that we can still rectify this\nsituation as long as we have you and a Trainer\r\nwho can help you achieve Mega Evolution.[VAR 0114(000E)]
Team MZ.\c\nYou’re in the remarkable position of having two\nTrainers who have achieved Rank A, so I must ask:\r\nWhich of you will attempt to subdue the tower?[VAR 0114(000E)]
I’ll do it.[VAR 0114(0006)]
I’ll do it.[VAR 0114(0005)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]But you and [VAR 0100(0000)] are both\nRank A\r\nnow,\r\n[VAR 018B(0001)]...[VAR 0114(000C)]
That’s right. So we should battle so I can prove\nthat I’m the strongest Trainer!\c\nAnd then I’ll be the one to save every person and\nPokémon in Lumiose![VAR 0114(0006)]
That’s right. So we should battle so I can prove\nthat I’m the strongest Trainer!\c\nAnd then I’ll be the one to save every person and\nPokémon in Lumiose![VAR 0114(0005)]
Sound fair, Vinnie?[VAR 0114(0006)]
Sound fair, Vinnie?[VAR 0114(0005)]
If that is what you both wish, I can hardly stand\nin your way.[VAR 0114(000E)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]All right, [VAR 0100(0000)]. Talk to me\nwhen\r\nyou’re\r\nready\r\nto\r\nbattle.[VAR 0114(0006)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]All right, [VAR 0100(0000)]. Talk to me\nwhen\r\nyou’re\r\nready\r\nto\r\nbattle.[VAR 0114(0005)]
I’ll admit I didn’t expect this to be how the\nstrongest Trainer in Lumiose would be decided.[VAR 0114(000E)]
I know [VAR 018B(0001)] must want to do this\n’cause [VAR 1100(00FF,0001)]she and Floette have a longer history, but\r\n[VAR 1100(00FF,0001)]she could still ease off a little...[VAR 0114(000C)]
I suppose only one of them will be able to go to\nthe top of the tower.\c\nAnd it must be hard to ease off when [VAR 1100(00FF,0001)]she’s so\nintent on saving Lumiose...[VAR 0114(000B)]
Kyururu...
[VAR BD06(0000)]I have complete faith in you all,\n[VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(000A)]

I’m gonna prove that I’m up to this—no matter\nwhat comes after![VAR 0114(0006)]
I’ll prove that I’m the one to handle this. As Team\nMZ’s leader, I’m ready for the responsibility![VAR 0114(0005)]
I won’t lose to you!
I’ll win this for the city!
I knew you’d say that
The winner tackles the tower! Let’s do this![VAR 0114(0006)]
The winner tackles the tower! Let’s do this![VAR 0114(0005)]
I wish I could have had you both share this role.\nIf only that were possible...[VAR 0114(000E)]
I’m not sure why [VAR 018B(0001)]’s so hung up on this—is\nit really just because [VAR 1100(00FF,0001)]she’s our team leader?[VAR 0114(000C)]
This’ll be a tough battle to watch... Whoever wins,\nthe outcome will be heavy.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Kyururu...

So I really am the strongest Trainer in Lumiose...\nthe strongest Mega Evolution user![VAR 0114(0006)]
So I really am the strongest Trainer in Lumiose...\nthe strongest Mega Evolution user![VAR 0114(0005)]
But listen. I couldn’t have reached this point—\ncouldn’t have grown so much as team leader—\r\nif it weren’t for you! I’m so glad we met![VAR 0114(0006)]
But listen. I couldn’t have reached this point—\ncouldn’t have grown so much as team leader—\r\nif it weren’t for you![VAR 0114(0005)]

So you really are Lumiose’s greatest Trainer...and\nthe strongest Mega Evolution user![VAR 0114(0005)]
You know, I’m really happy we met.\c\nHaving you as a member of Team MZ makes me\nproud to call myself its leader.[VAR 0114(0006)]
You know, I’m really happy we met.\c\nHaving you as a member of Team MZ makes me\nproud to call myself its leader.[VAR 0114(0005)]
It was a superb battle.[VAR 0114(000E)]
Now then, if the both of you are ready?[VAR 0114(000E)]
Man, Team MZ’s the best! I’m so lucky to be a\npart of it.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Man, Team MZ’s the best! I’m so lucky to be a\npart of it.[VAR 0114(0005)]
That was... Phew. That was an amazing battle.\nI don’t even have the words.[VAR 0114(000C)]
I’ve never been emotionally moved watching a\nbattle before...[VAR 0114(000B)]
[~ 127]
[VAR BD06(0000)]I believe matters have been settled.\n[VAR 0100(0000)]\r\nwill\r\nmake\r\nfor\r\nthe\r\ntower’s\r\ncontrol\r\ncenter\r\nwith Floette.[VAR 0114(000E)]
No, wait. Please...please let me go instead.[VAR 0114(0006)]
No, wait. Please...please let me do this instead.[VAR 0114(0005)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]What? But [VAR 0100(0000)] won! You\nsaid—[VAR 0114(000C)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]I know what I said, but...I still want to do my part\nto protect the people and Pokémon of Lumiose!\c\nAnd as the Trainer strong enough to beat me,\nI think [VAR 0100(0000)] has a job\r\nonly\r\nshe\r\ncan do.[VAR 0114(0006)]

Yeah! But there’s still something important that I\nneed to ask [VAR 0100(0000)] to do.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Yes! But there’s something important that I need\nto ask [VAR 0100(0000)] to do.[VAR 0114(0005)]
What do you mean?[VAR 0114(000B)]
[VAR BD06(0000)][VAR 0100(0000)], you’re the Trainer that\nthe\r\nLegendary\r\nPokémon\r\nZygarde\r\nfound worthy.[VAR 0114(0006)]
[VAR BD06(0000)][VAR 0100(0000)], you’re the Trainer that\nthe\r\nLegendary\r\nPokémon\r\nZygarde\r\nfound worthy.[VAR 0114(0005)]
That’s why I want to ask you and Zygarde to jump\nin and protect Lumiose if things go south.[VAR 0114(0006)]
That’s why I want to ask you and Zygarde to jump\nin and protect Lumiose if things go south.[VAR 0114(0005)]
The person I’m looking for is still somewhere in\nthis city—not to mention everyone else.\c\nLumiose is our home! Floette and I wanna make\nsure it stays safe for all us people and Pokémon![VAR 0114(0006)]
The person I’m looking for is still somewhere in\nthis city—not to mention everyone else.\c\nLumiose is our home! Floette and I want to make\nsure it stays safe for all us people and Pokémon![VAR 0114(0005)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Understood. I will also aid [VAR 0100(0000)]\ndown\r\nhere,\r\nas\r\nneeded.[VAR 0114(000E)]
Huh. I guess you were ready to do what needs to\nbe done, no matter who won.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Well, [VAR 1100(00FF,0001)]she’s not Team MZ’s leader for nothing.[VAR 0114(000B)]
AZ’s calling! I’ll put him on speaker.[VAR 0114(0006)]
AZ’s calling! I’ll put him on speaker.[VAR 0114(0005)]
What’s up, AZ?[VAR 0114(0006)]
What is it, AZ?[VAR 0114(0005)]
I hope you’ll forgive me for sending you to face\nthis most important of battles without me...\c\nIt seems that a life of three thousand years truly is\nasking more than a single human body can give.[VAR 0114(000A)]
I get it. All this stress about Prism Tower must be\ntaking a real toll on you.[VAR 0114(0006)]
I understand. All this stress about Prism Tower\nmust take a real toll on you.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Well, we won’t let the three thousand years you\nwaited to reunite with Floette go to waste!\c\nTeam MZ’s here to handle things so you two can\nlive in peace again![VAR 0114(0006)]
Well, we won’t let the three thousand years you\nwaited to reunite with Floette go to waste!\c\nTeam MZ will take care of everything so you two\ncan live in peace again![VAR 0114(0005)]
Your kindness means much, [VAR 018B(0001)].[VAR 0114(000A)]
[VAR 0100(0000)]...[VAR 0114(000A)]
Lida...[VAR 0114(000A)]
Naveen...[VAR 0114(000A)]
I have faith in each of you.\c\nI had hoped to protect Lumiose—to protect the\nentire region of Kalos. Carry on where I could not.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Safeguard the people and Pokémon of this city.\nThey are her future.[VAR 0114(000A)]
And to my dear Floette...\c\nI ask that you lend our Team MZ all the might of\nthe Eternal Flower.[VAR 0114(000A)]
You heard the man, Floette.[VAR 0114(0006)]
You heard the man, Floette.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Kyuru!
Let’s go![VAR 0114(0006)]
Here we go![VAR 0114(0005)]
[~ 169]
What’s going on?! I thought [VAR 1100(00FF,0001)]she had it under\ncontrol![VAR 0114(000C)]
Doesn’t look like it’s under control to me!\nIt’s going completely wild!\c\nAnd those things growing out of it—they look like\nparts of Floette’s Eternal Flower...[VAR 0114(000B)]
I must go update our Quasartico Inc. team and\nissue new orders.\c\nStay safe, all of you![VAR 0114(000E)]
Should we get down to the street?[VAR 0114(000C)]
I suppose we’d better. We wouldn’t want to be up\nhere if more tremors hit.[VAR 0114(000B)]
[~ 175]
So what’s Team MZ’s next move?[VAR 0114(000C)]
We have to help [VAR 018B(0001)]
We have to stop the tower
[VAR 0100(0000)]! Can you hear me?\c\nGotta say, the view’s incredible from up here![VAR 0114(0006)]
[VAR 0100(0000)]! Can you hear me?\c\nI have to say, things look incredible from up here![VAR 0114(0005)]
I knew Lumiose was big, but seeing it like this—\nthinking of all the people going about their lives\r\ndown below... I appreciate it more than ever!\c\nListen, Team MZ! It’s up to us to protect this city,\nno matter what it takes![VAR 0114(0006)]
I knew Lumiose was big, but seeing it like this—\nthinking of all the people going about their lives\r\ndown below... I appreciate it more than ever!\c\nListen, Team MZ! It’s up to us to protect this city,\nno matter what it takes![VAR 0114(0005)]
Backing up for a second—I’m glad you’re alive!\nHow are you not more scared for your life?![VAR 0114(000C)]
[VAR 018B(0001)], what’s going on up there? Are you\nall right?![VAR 0114(000B)]
I’m safe, I think! Mega Floette’s got my back.[VAR 0114(0006)]
I think I’m safe for now! Mega Floette’s got\nmy back.[VAR 0114(0005)]
But the tower’s gone totally berserk—it’s acting\nlike a Rogue Mega-Evolved Pokémon!\c\nI can’t control it at all, and it’s trying to fire off\nMega Floette’s moves![VAR 0114(0006)]
But I can’t control the tower at all. It’s trying to\nfire off Mega Floette’s moves![VAR 0114(0005)]
We’ll come save you!
What should we do?
I mean, I’d love a hand, but I’m not sure what\nexactly you should do...[VAR 0114(0006)]
I mean, I’d love a hand, but I don’t know what\nwould help...[VAR 0114(0005)]
Wait! I think—![VAR 0114(0006)]
Wait! I think—![VAR 0114(0005)]
What is it?[VAR 0114(000C)]
I see Zygarde on a rooftop in the Magenta\nDistrict! You should head there![VAR 0114(0006)]
I see Zygarde on a rooftop in the Magenta\nDistrict! You should head there![VAR 0114(0005)]
I think it might be waiting for you! Hurry![VAR 0114(0006)]
I think it might be waiting for you! Hurry![VAR 0114(0005)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Er, [VAR 018B(0001)]...can you hold that thought\na moment?[VAR 0114(000B)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]What for? We need [VAR 0100(0000)]\nto\r\nteam\r\nup\r\nwith\r\nZygarde![VAR 0114(0006)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]What for? We need [VAR 0100(0000)]\nto\r\nteam\r\nup\r\nwith\r\nZygarde![VAR 0114(0005)]
I think the tower going rogue is causing other\nPokémon to undergo Rogue Mega Evolution![VAR 0114(000B)]
AZ was right! This is bad—we gotta fight![VAR 0114(000C)]
[~ 205]
Do you want to attempt the battle again?
Try again
Give up
[~ 209]
Whew. Good thing we managed to calm them.[VAR 0114(000B)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Here, [VAR 0100(0000)]—I’ll heal\nyour Pokémon.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Oh! Hang on, I’ve got an idea![VAR 0114(000C)]
Here we go! Just what we need![VAR 0114(000C)]
What for?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Well, what does Team MZ do when we need a\nplan? [VAR 0100(0000)] knows, right?[VAR 0114(000C)]
Oh yeah, the thing!
A strategy meeting!
Yup! It’s strategy meeting time![VAR 0114(000C)]
All right. We’ve got two objectives: calm down the\nRogue Mega-Evolved Pokémon all over the city...\c\nand rescue [VAR 018B(0001)] and Floette from the tower![VAR 0114(000C)]
We ought to consider what [VAR 018B(0001)] proposed,\nfor starters.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Going to meet Zygarde? Yeah, but getting to it is\ngonna be rough...[VAR 0114(000C)]
There’s a ton of building debris in the way, not to\nmention those roots that the tower sprouted.[VAR 0114(000C)]
I could take the rooftops
I could climb the wreckage
You think you could climb that wreckage and then\ngo via the rooftops?[VAR 0114(000B)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]I know you’re great, [VAR 0100(0000)],\nbut\r\nthat’s\r\na\r\nlot\r\nfor\r\nany\r\none person...[VAR 0114(000C)]
Even with our trusty partners, I doubt we three\ncould make it all the way to Zygarde on our own...[VAR 0114(000B)]
Watt’s zappin’, Team MZ? Canari from DYN4MO\nis here to help jump-start this show![VAR 0114(000F)]
Wha—?![VAR 0114(000B)]
Check it—I brought backup, too.[VAR 0114(000F)]
What are you all doing crashing our meeting?![VAR 0114(000C)]
I just thought you might need some help sorting\nall this out, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0013)]
The Fist of Justice will not stand by while our\ncity is in danger. You can count on us![VAR 0114(0011)]
Good to see you are still unscathed, Team MZ.[VAR 0114(000E)]
I’ve had my hands rather full fielding calls from\nthe top-ranked Trainers who were provided with\r\nMega Rings by Quasartico Inc.\c\nI was trying to explain the entire situation.\nHowever...[VAR 0114(000E)]
Ms. Canari here decided she would rather move\nstraight to crashing Team MZ’s group chat.[VAR 0114(000E)]
How we got on this call’s hardly important now.\nWhat’s going on, and how can we help?[VAR 0114(0013)]
R-right! According to [VAR 018B(0001)], who’s up in the\ntower right now...\c\nwe need to find a way to reach the Magenta\nDistrict rooftops, where Zygarde’s waiting.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Uh...what? Get it to come here instead.[VAR 0114(000F)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Could it be that Zygarde is testing\n[VAR 0100(0000)]’s\r\nabilities?[VAR 0114(0011)]
Who’s to say what’s going on in Zygarde’s head.\c\n[VAR BD06(0000)]Let’s just help [VAR 0100(0000)] get\nover\r\nto it.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Alors, the thought of entrusting you few with\nsuch a crucial task fills me with unease...[VAR 0114(0015)]
Nice of you to show up and immediately start\ncomplaining, princess![VAR 0114(0013)]
I was having Lebanne gather information. We\nelites know better than to rush in blindly![VAR 0114(0015)]
Now, if you will all check your Rotom Phones,\nI have sent you each our findings.[VAR 0114(0015)]
This image shows an aerial view of Centrico Plaza.\c\nAt its center sits Prism Tower, out of which grows\nthis vicious floral monstrosity...[VAR 0114(0015)]
Yikes, what a mess... Not even Pops could fix all\nthat overnight.[VAR 0114(000F)]
We need to do something about those flowers\nbefore anyone does any fixing.[VAR 0114(0013)]
What do you say, Mr. Justice? Think you could\ntake ’em on with those big muscles of yours?[VAR 0114(0013)]
Thank you for the compliment...but even my\nseasoned strength would not be nearly enough.[VAR 0114(0011)]
I believe our priority right now is to secure a route\nfor [VAR 0100(0000)].\c\nThat much I’m certain we can handle between us.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Hold up—did Ivor just say somethin’...reasonable?\nNow THAT’S a shock![VAR 0114(000F)]
He’s right! With all of us working together, we\ncan clear a way for [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(000C)]
Very well. Let us decide among ourselves who\nwill handle which area.[VAR 0114(0015)]
All right, let’s go over what we’ve decided.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Each of us is gonna try to keep the Rogue\nPokémon at bay in our area.\c\n[VAR BD06(0000)][VAR 0100(0000)]’ll come link up\nwith\r\nus\r\nso\r\nwe\r\ncan\r\ncollab\r\non\r\nclearin’\r\na\r\npath\r\nto\r\nZygarde.[VAR 0114(000F)]
Thank you so much! Who knows what we\nwould’ve done without you![VAR 0114(000B)]
We’re lucky that all of us high-ranked Trainers are\nscattered evenly around Lumiose’s five districts.[VAR 0114(0013)]
If you would all indulge me for a moment, I have\none minor concern to raise...[VAR 0114(0015)]
Now?! We’re in the middle of an emergency![VAR 0114(0013)]
It occurs to me that Grisham is not among us.[VAR 0114(0015)]
I mean, that’s true...but shouldn’t we focus on\nwhat those of us who ARE here can do?[VAR 0114(000C)]
His absence will vex me until he competes in the\nnext Super-Tournoi de Jacinthe![VAR 0114(0015)]
You can worry about your precious tournament\nlater, Jacinthe!\c\nHonestly, do you even get how crazy it is that\nwe’re all here like this?\c\nWe come from all walks of life, yet we crossed\npaths simply due to our various ties to this city,\r\nthen butted heads in our promotion matches.\c\nAnd now, we’re helping each other out.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Come on, you lot! It’s up to us to save our city![VAR 0114(0013)]
[VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0008)]
One last bit of advice from the detective charged\nwith protecting Lumiose![VAR 0114(0008)]
Trust in L!\c\nHe’s not like the old Lysandre from Team Flare—\nI’m sure he has no interest in taking lives.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Trust in Zygarde, and lend it your strength![VAR 0114(0008)]
I’ll take care of everyone outside of Centrico Plaza,\nso please...take care of things where you are![VAR 0114(0008)]
That was for real the wildest strategy meeting\nwe’ve ever had.[VAR 0114(000C)]
No time to focus on that, Lida. The crucial part’s\nstill to come.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Right. We don’t even know yet how we’re gonna\nstop the tower.\c\nSo I guess we’ve just gotta bet everything on the\npossibility [VAR 018B(0001)] mentioned—that Zygarde can\r\nhelp us fix this mess.[VAR 0114(000C)]
We have no choice but to do whatever we can.\c\nMy daughter waits at home for my return. I must\ndo my best for her and all those living in Lumiose.[VAR 0114(000E)]
I know we need all the help we can get, but I’d\nrather not owe the Rust Syndicate any favors...[VAR 0114(000C)]
Perhaps the abnormal state of the tower really is\nwhat’s been drawing wild Pokémon to the city...[VAR 0114(000B)]
First, head for the rendezvous point where Ivor\nand Gwynn are waiting![VAR 0114(000B)]
[~ 278]
[VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0011)]
Ivor, martial arts prodigy and founder of the Fist\nof Justice, at your service![VAR 0114(0011)]
[VAR 1100(00FF,0201)]HShe knows who you are, dummy.[VAR 0114(0012)]
We’ll take point in this district, as was discussed\nat the strategy meeting.[VAR 0114(0011)]
If you’re wondering, I was the one holding Ivor’s\nphone during the meeting...as usual.\c\nHe’d crush it in his giant fists otherwise.[VAR 0114(0012)]
The Rogue Pokémon certainly are out in force.[VAR 0114(0011)]
A dire situation such as this requires teamwork.\nWe must battle arm in arm to make it through![VAR 0114(0011)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Do anything “arm in arm” with Ivor, and he’ll\nbreak your bones...\c\nJust stick with me, OK,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0012)]
[~ 287]
Justice prevails![VAR 0114(0011)]
There’s no end to them...but there’s also no one\ngetting angry at me for battling too much![VAR 0114(0011)]
At last, it is time for me to unleash the strength\nI’ve gained training with the Fist of Justice![VAR 0114(0011)]
Ivor... Remember the plan.[VAR 0114(0012)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]We’re fighting to get\n[VAR 0100(0000)]\r\nto\r\nthe\r\nnext\r\nrendezvous\r\npoint.[VAR 0114(0012)]
It’s time for me to make a stand.[VAR 0114(0012)]
Go on ahead, [VAR 0100(0000)]. Hurry.[VAR 0114(0012)]
Oh, Gwynn...you’re fighting for me at last?[VAR 0114(0011)]
Wrong again, Ivor.[VAR 0114(0012)]
[VAR 0100(0000)]. Bump me.[VAR 0114(0012)]
Good luck.[VAR 0114(0012)]
Let’s get moving![VAR 0114(0011)]
Catch me if you can...[VAR 0114(0012)]
We must press onward![VAR 0114(0011)]
[~ 302]
Ah... It seems we cannot reach the bridge due to\nall this debris.[VAR 0114(0011)]
I could simply leap across the water with my\nfinely honed muscles, but that is no help to you.[VAR 0114(0011)]
We had best find another way.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Any clever ideas, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0011)]
We could use some of the rubble?
That pile of paneling could help?
I see![VAR 0114(0011)]
That section of the wall that was around the tower\nwould make a fine bridge if we can knock it down.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Hmm... Even my mighty fists may struggle to fell\nsuch a massive target.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Falinks![VAR 0114(0011)]
Time to Mega Evolve![VAR 0114(0011)]
One Trainer! One Pokémon! One heart!\nJUSTIIICE PUUUNCH!!![VAR 0114(0011)]
There you go! A way across.[VAR 0114(0011)]
I see Falinks saved the day.[VAR 0114(0012)]
Gwynn! You’re alive![VAR 0114(0011)]
Quiet down. Of course I’m alive.[VAR 0114(0012)]
My apologies... I can’t help but worry about you\never since that time you went missing.[VAR 0114(0011)]
It was making me nervous to leave you\nunsupervised, Ivor. So here I am.[VAR 0114(0012)]
Save your concern for Lumiose, not me.[VAR 0114(0012)]
Right! Let us see the plan through to its finish![VAR 0114(0011)]
Other Rogue Pokémon will undoubtedly appear.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Hurry to Zygarde, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0012)]
Yes, go on ahead! For Lumiose![VAR 0114(0011)]
For justiiice![VAR 0114(0011)]
Quiet.[VAR 0114(0012)]
[~ 328]
Yo![VAR 0114(000F)]
Things ain’t lookin’ great, huh?[VAR 0114(000F)]
Those poor Pokémon ain’t exactly actin’ out for\nthe fun of it, either.[VAR 0114(0010)]
So? We doin’ something about it, or...?[VAR 0114(000F)]
Yeah, we have to!
We need your help!
Like I said in the strategy meeting, we’re here to\nhelp you out.[VAR 0114(000F)]
Bet. That’s why I’m here, y’know.[VAR 0114(000F)]
Lumiose is my city—I was born and raised here.\nThere’s no way I’m sittin’ this out![VAR 0114(000F)]
Don’t count me out either, kid! It ain’t luck that\nran my construction company all these years.[VAR 0114(0010)]
I’d never let Canari deal with this alone. Besides,\nI can’t just stand by while my city takes a beatin’![VAR 0114(0010)]
I feel bad for Blastoise and Steelix... Looks like\nRogue Mega Evolution’s really hurtin’ them.[VAR 0114(000F)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Let’s go, [VAR 0100(0000)]. These\nRogue\r\nPokémon\r\nain’t\r\ngonna\r\nsave\r\nthemselves![VAR 0114(000F)]
We’ll work on puttin’ together some scaffolding\nso ya can keep movin’ ahead![VAR 0114(0010)]
Look lively, folks! We got a big job to do![VAR 0114(0010)]
Got it, boss!
You there! This is a work site, not a stand-back-\nand-watch site! Zap to it![VAR 0114(0010)]
I beg your pardon?[VAR 0114(0035)]
Me? You want ME to help, too?![VAR 0114(0035)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]C’mon, [VAR 0100(0000)]. Show us why\nwe\r\nshould\r\ncall\r\nyou\r\nthe\r\nstrongest\r\nMega\r\nEvolution user![VAR 0114(000F)]
You should hurry on ahead!
[~ 350]
You may be the MVP of the Z-A Royale, but me\nand Eelektross get the award for most improved![VAR 0114(000F)]
Here, lemme heal up your hardworkin’ Pokémon.[VAR 0114(000F)]
We got our work done while ya were battlin’.\nFeast yer eyes on our scaffolding masterpiece![VAR 0114(0010)]
Dang, Pops! You didn’t have to go this hard...\nLike, seriously. We just needed a path forward.[VAR 0114(000F)]
If it’s worth doin’, it’s worth overdoin’! Excadrill\nand the team really pulled out all the stops.\c\nI think it’s fair to say this is our finest, most\namazin’ scaffolding course yet![VAR 0114(0010)]
But I’m sure yer up for the challenge, eh, kid?[VAR 0114(0010)]
NOBODY NEEDS A CHALLENGE RIGHT NOW![VAR 0114(000F)]
When Lumiose needs fixin’, we fix it right up![VAR 0114(0010)]
But we can’t repair lives that’re lost...so we’re\ncountin’ on ya to get out there and do yer thing![VAR 0114(0010)]
Me and Eelektross can take care of any Rogue\nPokémon! Go, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(000F)]
Ever since you beat me, I’ve been watchin’ tons of\nbattle streams so I could up my game.[VAR 0114(000F)]
Guess me and Excadrill got a little carried away.\nThe rest of the crew, too, actually...[VAR 0114(0010)]
This scaffolding is for the future of Lumiose itself!\nIt’s the finest work we’ve ever done.
Isn’t it awful how scaffolding gets taken apart the\nmoment it no longer has a purpose? Life is cruel.
Have you been good about trading in Colorful\nScrews for Canari plush?
Wanna know how many scaffolds we’ve put up\naround Lumiose? Close to 50 of ’em!
Canari’s grandpa is so kind! He told me that I’m\ngood at more than just quizzes![VAR 0114(0035)]
[~ 368]
GOOOOOOAL!!![VAR 0114(0010)]
Nicely done, kid! We put our hearts and souls into\nthat obstacle course, and ya cleared it beautifully![VAR 0114(0010)]
For real, that was all kinds of impressive![VAR 0114(000F)]
Uh-oh. Looks like trouble just joined the chat.[VAR 0114(000F)]
Guess that’s the price of bein’ the cutest, coolest,\ncleverest streamer in Lumiose![VAR 0114(0010)]
You mean in Kalos, yeah? Anyway, how’s your\nback holdin’ up, Pops?[VAR 0114(000F)]
It’ll hold up however long it needs to for my city\nand my grandkid![VAR 0114(0010)]
Now go for it, folks! The deadline’s loomin’![VAR 0114(0010)]
Any-percent speedrun mode! Let’s go![VAR 0114(000F)]
[~ 378]
Greetings. I have been expecting you.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Where’s Jacinthe?
Lebanne? But why—?
Hello there, my dear [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0015)]
You must be terribly disappointed to be met by\nLebanne instead of myself. I do apologize.[VAR 0114(0015)]
Unfortunately, there is work elsewhere to which\nonly an elite like myself can attend![VAR 0114(0015)]
Such as liaising with the mayor and mobilizing\nthe forces needed to defend our city.[VAR 0114(0015)]
Which is why my dear Lebanne is present to\nsupport you on my behalf.[VAR 0114(0015)]
She is as fine a battler as you will ever meet, so I\nexpect that she will be of some assistance to you.[VAR 0114(0015)]
And so, my dear [VAR 0100(0000)]...\c\nI kindly ask that you pacify those poor Rogue\nMega-Evolved Pokémon before I arrive there.[VAR 0114(0015)]
Now, I send you all my love and best wishes with\nthis beautiful bump of my fist![VAR 0114(0015)]
Lebanne, I trust you will do your utmost to aid our\ndear friend. Try not to be a hindrance.[VAR 0114(0015)]
With that, I bid you adieu.[VAR 0114(0015)]
Yeesh, she loves running her mouth.[VAR 0114(0016)]
As if I’d ever be a “hindrance.” Gimme a break.[VAR 0114(0016)]
After all, it’s not every day I get to take on worthy\nopponents like Rogue Mega-Evolved Pokémon![VAR 0114(0016)]
Don’t worry, I know this isn’t just fun and games.\c\nThese Pokémon have Mega Evolved against their\nwill, and they’re suffering from it.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Well, my partner and I are gonna use our strength\nto free them from their suffering.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Let’s do this![VAR 0114(0016)]
[~ 398]
That was awesome! You killed it out there![VAR 0114(0016)]
Man, it feels great to battle side by side with\nsomeone who’s not uptight.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Fighting beside Jacinthe is always kind of a\nstruggle for me, honestly.[VAR 0114(0016)]
What is it you struggle with, Lebanne?[VAR 0114(0015)]
WHAT IN THE—?![VAR 0114(0016)]
When the heck did you—? I mean, how long—?\nUh...[VAR 0114(0016)]
It was nothing, Lady Jacinthe. Pay me no mind.[VAR 0114(0016)]
We will revisit your attitude and choice of words\nanother time.[VAR 0114(0015)]
For now, it appears some uninvited guests have\ndecided to join us, Lebanne.[VAR 0114(0015)]
Naturally, Lady Jacinthe. Your renown draws\ncrowds. But I fear they have us outnumbered.[VAR 0114(0016)]
You have a point. They look like quite a handful,\neven with the combined efforts of myself,\r\nLebanne, and you, [VAR 0100(0000)]...[VAR 0114(0015)]
I think this calls for our secret weapon.[VAR 0114(0015)]
Yes, Lady Jacinthe. Kindly follow me this way.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Your attention, please, dear Pokémon![VAR 0114(0015)]
Allow me to welcome you into Lady Jacinthe’s\npersonal battle arena![VAR 0114(0016)]
Jacinthe zone: ON![VAR 0114(0015)]
This Jacinthe zone should be enough to impede\nany Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Please continue on, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0015)]
Let’s go, Dragalge! You and me are gonna keep\nthese streets safe![VAR 0114(0016)]
Come, my dearest Clefable! Let us show our new\nfriends the finest hospitality. For Lumiose![VAR 0114(0015)]
Drah!
Clable!
[~ 421]
Report in, Philippe. How’s it look over there?[VAR 0114(0013)]
I see. That’ll work fine.\c\nNe’er-do-wells like us gotta show what we’re\nreally worth at times like these.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Me?[VAR 0114(0013)]
I’m getting a real warm welcome from a couple of\nRogue Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0013)]
But don’t you worry ’bout me. Our favorite\ndo-gooder just came to the rescue.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Listen, Philippe. This situation’s bound to have\npeople feeling down in the dumps. You and your\r\ncrew get something ready to lift people up.\c\nLike a cookout—or maybe something special.[VAR 0114(0013)]
About time you showed up.[VAR 0114(0013)]
By the looks of it, these friendly Rogue Pokémon\nhave been waiting for you too.[VAR 0114(0013)]
I think it’s time we work together again. Been a\nminute since we did, eh?[VAR 0114(0013)]
Don’t worry. Me and Scolipede have your back.[VAR 0114(0013)]
[~ 432]
I’ve got my grunts waiting up ahead.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Come on, let’s get moving.[VAR 0114(0013)]
[~ 435]
Psh. Philippe isn’t here yet?[VAR 0114(0013)]
’Fraid not, sir.[VAR 0114(001D)]
Sorry I’m late, boss.[VAR 0114(0014)]
You were supposed to put up a ladder here.\c\nSo tell me—why don’t I see one? Am I just an\nidiot who can’t spot a big old ladder?[VAR 0114(0013)]
Well, we tried setting up a ladder, boss. We even\ntried the Holovators, and—[VAR 0114(001D)]
And what? All your “trying” doesn’t seem to have\nresulted in anything to show![VAR 0114(0013)]
Well, uh...Rogue Pokémon busted them up, boss.\nThey smashed everything.[VAR 0114(001D)]
Guess we gotta do something about this\nourselves, then.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Rust Syndicate! Time to show our mettle![VAR 0114(0013)]
You got it, boss![VAR 0114(001D)]
Once you choose your path, there’s no turning\nback. The only way is forward.[VAR 0114(0014)]
Y’know how Mega Evolution’s an expression of\nthe bonds between Pokémon and people?[VAR 0114(0013)]
Here’s an expression of the bonds between the\nmembers of the Rust Syndicate! A human ladder![VAR 0114(0013)]
Boss! Mr. Corbeau!\c\nWe’ve already fallen off the straight and narrow,\nand at this rate, we’re gonna fall short here too![VAR 0114(001D)]
Looks like we’re one rung—I mean, one\nperson—short...[VAR 0114(0013)]
What do we do now?
Do we call someone?
Only one thing to do. My grunts are giving their\nall—and as their leader, I need to give just as\r\nmuch...and then some![VAR 0114(0013)]
Don’t you worry about me.[VAR 0114(0013)]
My word’s my bond, and I’m not breaking\neither tonight![VAR 0114(0013)]
This is our highest calling! Literally![VAR 0114(0013)]
No need to hesitate. Climb on up!\c\nI mean it—don’t dillydally. You’d better climb up\nquick, ’cause I don’t know how long we’ll last![VAR 0114(0013)]
[~ 458]
Go get ’em, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0013)]
[~ 460]
What’re you doing down here?[VAR 0114(0013)]
You fell off?![VAR 0114(0013)]
You better get back up here![VAR 0114(0013)]
[~ 464]
We’re all counting on you, chief![VAR 0114(0013)]
[~ 466]
What happened this time?[VAR 0114(0013)]
Seriously, you fell off AGAIN?![VAR 0114(0013)]
Get yourself back up here, now![VAR 0114(0013)]
[~ 470]
Stop making me do all this physical labor, OK?[VAR 0114(0013)]
[~ 472]
... ... ...[VAR 0114(0013)]
Are you doing this on purpose?! Having a bit of\nfun at the Rust Syndicate’s expense, are we?[VAR 0114(0013)]
This is your last chance, kid! Step on it and get\nyourself up here already![VAR 0114(0013)]
[~ 476]
The fate of Lumiose is on your shoulders now!\c\nAnd you’re seriously testing MY shoulders, as\nwell as my patience! Fall off again, and we’re\r\nhaving that Pokémon showdown at Hotel Z![VAR 0114(0013)]
Don’t you dare fall off again, kid![VAR 0114(0013)]
[~ 479]
METAAAHHH!!!
KSHAAAHHHH!!!
Oh my. Do we have some late customers?[VAR 0114(0004)]
I’m afraid that Nouveau Café is closed for the day.[VAR 0114(0017)]
But you seem to be in need of some help from\nus anyway, don’t you?\c\nWell, we offer more than fresh, fragrant blends.\nWe’ve got high-quality Trainers, too.[VAR 0114(0018)]
Talking will have to wait. We have Pokémon to\ntake care of.[VAR 0114(0017)]
[~ 486]
Now then, with that disturbance taken care of...[VAR 0114(0017)]
I’d say it’s time for a little coffee break.[VAR 0114(0017)]
One Ember Roast, our signature drink at Nouveau\nCafé. Take it already![VAR 0114(0018)]
I bet your Pokémon are feeling as perked up as\nanything now too, right?[VAR 0114(0018)]
You know, many people have likened the bitter\ndepths of a fine roast to the nature of life itself.\r\nAt times like these, I quite see what they mean.[VAR 0114(0017)]
We failed to keep the tower from running amok.\nNow we must rely on you to salvage the situation.[VAR 0114(0017)]
What are you going to do?
Then where will you head?
I will never be able to outrun my connection to\nTeam Flare.[VAR 0114(0017)]
Nor can I change those who will never forgive\nTeam Flare for what happened five years ago.[VAR 0114(0017)]
What I can control is what I do next.[VAR 0114(0017)]
I will protect the people of this city. No matter\nwhat they may think of me.[VAR 0114(0017)]
And what about you? What is it that you most\nwant to achieve now?[VAR 0114(0017)]
I want to help [VAR 018B(0001)]
I want to stop the tower
That is a noble desire. Now, let us each set out to\naccomplish what we must.[VAR 0114(0017)]
Zeeehd!
I suspect Zygarde has been watching to see if you\nwould make it this far.[VAR 0114(0017)]
And now it shows itself at last, having deemed\nyou worthy to battle alongside it...[VAR 0114(0017)]
Looks like we’ve got more customers incoming.\nNot sure they’ll appreciate our blends, though.[VAR 0114(0018)]
Unlikely—at least not when they’ve gone rogue\nlike this. Let’s get them back to seeing reason.[VAR 0114(0017)]
You go do something about that tower.\c\nAfter all, the café can’t exactly turn a profit if that\nthing blasts away half the neighborhood.[VAR 0114(0018)]
We will handle this area for you.[VAR 0114(0017)]
This way![VAR 0114(0018)]
Zeeehd!
[~ 512]
Hey, [VAR 0100(0000)].\c\nI can see you from up here. Looks like you met up\nwith Zygarde, huh?[VAR 0114(0006)]
Hey, [VAR 0100(0000)].\c\nI see you from up here. I’m glad you found your\nway to Zygarde![VAR 0114(0005)]
Remember the day we met, how we got a glimpse\nof Floette’s Light of Ruin?\c\nThat move’s gonna pack even more punch now.\nWatch yourself if Ange Floette starts attacking![VAR 0114(0006)]
Remember the day we met, how we got a glimpse\nof Floette’s Light of Ruin?\c\nThat move’s gonna pack even more punch now.\nWatch yourself if Ange Floette starts attacking![VAR 0114(0005)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Zygarde! You and [VAR 0100(0000)]\nhave\r\nto\r\nsave\r\nFloette!\r\nAnd\r\nall\r\nof Lumiose![VAR 0114(0006)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Zygarde! You and [VAR 0100(0000)]\nhave\r\nto\r\nsave\r\nFloette!\r\nAnd\r\nall\r\nof Lumiose![VAR 0114(0005)]
Zeee-ah!
I see you have proven yourself worthy of\nZygarde’s trust, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0004)]
I have gathered 99 of the lost Zygarde Cells.[VAR 0114(0019)]
Only one cell remains—the one percent needed to\ncomplete Zygarde at last.[VAR 0114(0019)]
But afterward, will Zygarde—and you—truly be\nable to pacify this raging monstrosity?[VAR 0114(0019)]
Will you be able to save Floette and your friend,\nwho are trapped within this rogue tower?[VAR 0114(0019)]
The answer lies with you.[VAR 0114(0019)]
I know that I was once among those who choose\nto take rather than to give...\c\nBut that is no way to save the world.[VAR 0114(0019)]
You must be one who gives![VAR 0114(0019)]
Give to Zygarde that which is dear to you as\na Trainer!\c\nGive it the courage that drives you to stand and\nfight! Give it the opening it needs to attack![VAR 0114(0019)]
[~ 529]
Zygarde transformed into its Complete Forme...\nIs that what it had to do to restore order?[VAR 0114(0006)]
Zygarde transformed into its Complete Forme...\nIs that what it had to do to restore order?[VAR 0114(0005)]
You have to damage Ange Floette’s flowers![VAR 0114(0006)]
You have to damage Ange Floette’s flowers![VAR 0114(0005)]
Damaging the flowers takes some of the fury out\nof the tower’s rampage![VAR 0114(0006)]
Damaging the flowers takes some of the fury out\nof the tower’s rampage![VAR 0114(0005)]
Yes! The tower’s getting weaker. Now Zygarde\nhas an opening to attack![VAR 0114(0006)]
Great! The tower’s getting weaker. Now Zygarde\nhas an opening to attack![VAR 0114(0005)]
Zygarde’s move hit the tower HARD![VAR 0114(0006)]
Zygarde’s move hit the tower HARD![VAR 0114(0005)]
Nice! Mega Floette’s gaining a little control over\nthe tower![VAR 0114(0006)]
Yes! Mega Floette’s gaining a little control over\nthe tower![VAR 0114(0005)]
Was that Zygarde’s ultimate move?! That was\nincredible...[VAR 0114(0006)]
Was that Zygarde’s ultimate move?! That was\nincredible...[VAR 0114(0005)]
Keep it up! Floette should be able to take full\ncontrol of the tower![VAR 0114(0006)]
Keep it up! Floette should be able to take full\ncontrol of the tower![VAR 0114(0005)]
You defeated Ange Floette!
[~ 547]
You put an end to Ange Floette’s rampage!
[~ 549]
The tower—or Ange or whatever it’s called—it\nstopped![VAR 0114(000C)]
It seems you and Zygarde managed to save the\nday, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(000B)]
Yo, don’t forget about us![VAR 0114(000F)]
What about all the Rogue Pokémon?[VAR 0114(0012)]
They have all been pacified.[VAR 0114(0016)]
When the top-ranked Trainers of the Z-A Royale\njoin forces, we can accomplish anything![VAR 0114(0011)]
Alors, that goes without saying![VAR 0114(0015)]
All thanks to the superstar of Lumiose—Jacinthe!\nAnd the rest of you, I suppose.[VAR 0114(0015)]
Sure, fine... Whatever you say at this point...[VAR 0114(0013)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Thank you all, seriously! Especially you,\n[VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0006)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Thank you all so much! Especially you,\n[VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0005)]
[VAR 018B(0001)]! Are you all right?[VAR 0114(000C)]
I’m fine! I’m totally fine.[VAR 0114(0006)]
I’m fine! Takes more than this to faze me.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Now all that’s left is for Mega Floette to take\ncontrol of Ange and put all this to bed.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Now all that’s left is for Mega Floette to take\ncontrol of Ange, and we’ll finally be done![VAR 0114(0005)]
And once we get all this cleaned up, I trust\nQuasartico’s gonna throw us a nice celebration?[VAR 0114(0006)]
And I trust Quasartico will put together a nice\nparty to celebrate once things calm down?[VAR 0114(0005)]
I’ll see that it happens![VAR 0114(000E)]
Splendid! I believe Richissime would be the ideal\nvenue for such a gathering, when the time comes.[VAR 0114(0015)]
Pass.[VAR 0114(0012)]
I’m down for whatever, so long as everyone has a\ngood time. Zap ya later![VAR 0114(000F)]
After all, it’s thanks to the efforts of Team MZ\nthat we managed to stop the tower.[VAR 0114(000E)]
I imagine AZ must be smiling.[VAR 0114(000E)]
Just one last step, Floette! Do your thing![VAR 0114(000C)]
What was that sound?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Good question...[VAR 0114(000C)]
Wait, it can still move? What’s Ange trying to do?![VAR 0114(0006)]
Wait, it can still move? What’s Ange trying to do?![VAR 0114(0005)]
[~ 579]
Do you want to attempt the battle with Ange\nFloette again?
Try again
Prepare and try again
Give up
You’ll be returned to the events that occurred\njust before the battle. Is that OK?
Yes
No
You’ll be returned to the events that occurred\nbefore the tower went out of control. Is that OK?
Yes, I give up for now...
No, I’m not giving up yet
[~ 590]
It can’t be...[VAR 0114(000E)]
No! No way![VAR 0114(000C)]
If Ange fires Floette’s Light of Ruin while it’s all\npowered up like this...[VAR 0114(000C)]
...There won’t be any Lumiose left to rebuild![VAR 0114(000B)]
Something inside your satchel is...shaking?
Some kind of power is emanating from your\npebble...
The pebble transformed into a Zygardite stone!
[~ 598]
Even his grave is imposing... I guess that’s fitting\nfor AZ, in a way.[VAR 0114(000C)]
It seems like he handled all the preparations for it\nby himself.\c\nHe had me take his measurements. But he told\nme it was so I could make him some new clothes,\r\nnot so he could have his grave dug...[VAR 0114(000B)]
Keep watching over Lumiose, AZ. We’ll make sure\nit becomes like you wanted—a city of harmony\r\nbetween us and Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Keep watching over Lumiose, AZ. We’ll make sure\nit becomes like you wanted—a city of harmony\r\nbetween us and Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0005)]
For three thousand long years, he bid farewell to\nso many...and now, we bid farewell to him.[VAR 0114(0019)]
Let’s go home. We need a good meal![VAR 0114(0006)]
Let’s go home. I think we need a good meal.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Yes! That! I’m starving.[VAR 0114(000C)]
It’ll be that curry again, I suppose.[VAR 0114(000B)]
We’ve got so much left to take care of. So many\nthings to clean up and set right...[VAR 0114(000B)]
Thank you for everything, AZ...
May you finally rest at peace...
We’ll handle things from here

Some days after the events with the tower, as\ncalm begins to return to the city...
Your alarm is going off...
[~ 2]
Mornin’! Or afternoon, I guess.[VAR 0114(000C)]
It’s not been a restful few days for any of us, I\nimagine.\c\nNot after that awful battle with the tower, and...\nAZ passing away...[VAR 0114(000B)]
Yeah, that awful tower won’t quit hanging around\nin my nightmares.[VAR 0114(000C)]
At least they’ve been able to clean things up.\c\nThe reopening ceremony for Centrico Plaza should\nbe wrapping up about now, in fact.[VAR 0114(000B)]
I’m glad the plaza’s fixed, but is now really the\ntime for having ceremonies?[VAR 0114(000C)]
Now is exactly the time, I’d say. We’ve GOT to\ncelebrate where we can, even if it feels hard.\c\nAfter two catastrophes in five years, Lumiose\nneeds all the happy occasions it can get.[VAR 0114(000B)]
I guess you have a point.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Anyway, did you figure out what you’re gonna do,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(000C)]
What I’ll do?
About what?
About your wish! The one you get for reaching\nRank A![VAR 0114(000C)]
You should’ve gotten a message about it when\nyou signed up on the Z-A app.[VAR 0114(000C)]
“Anyone who attains the highest rank, Rank A,\nwill earn the right to call themselves one of\r\nLumiose’s strongest Trainers and be granted a\r\nwish, as long as it is in our power to fulfill.”\r\nDoes that ring a bell?[VAR 0114(000B)]
I suppose your next step would be to talk to\nVinnie about what you desire.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Well, you’ll need to figure out what to ask for\nfirst, right?\c\nYou saved the city. I bet they’d give you anything![VAR 0114(000C)]
Hey, everyone—c’mere a sec.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Hey, all of you—come here a second![VAR 0114(0005)]
[~ 20]
I found something while I was sorting through\nAZ’s stuff.[VAR 0114(0006)]
I found something while I was sorting through\nAZ’s stuff.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Is that a letter?[VAR 0114(000C)]
Could it be his will?[VAR 0114(000B)]
I think so. Here, I’ll read it out.[VAR 0114(0006)]
I think so. Here, I’ll read it out.[VAR 0114(0005)]
“To Team MZ, my dear friends...\c\n“If you are reading this letter, then it would seem\nmy time has finally come to an end.[VAR 0114(0006)]
“I leave you these instructions and final wishes.\nFirst, do with Hotel Z as you see fit. It is yours.\c\n“If keeping it running would place a burden on\nyour young lives, you may sell it.[VAR 0114(0006)]
“I ask only that you continue to look after Floette\nand all those who live in Lumiose City.\c\n“I have been blessed to see the people of the city\ngrow closer to all their new Pokémon neighbors.\c\n“It is as you young ones once said—a joining of\nX and Y axes that were never expected to meet.\c\n“May you all bring about a true evolution in the\nrelationship between Pokémon and humankind.[VAR 0114(0006)]
“I have lived so very, very long and seen so many\ngo before me...\c\n“But thanks to you all, I know I will now go to\nmeet my own ending with a smile on my face.\c\n“I thank you from the bottom of this old heart.”\n...Signed “AZ.”[VAR 0114(0006)]

Oh, AZ...[VAR 0114(000C)]
When we left him on the roof, the day the tower\nwent berserk...he must have already been\r\nprepared for his end.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Yeah, I think so...[VAR 0114(0006)]
Yeah, I think so...[VAR 0114(0005)]
So...what WILL we do about the hotel?[VAR 0114(000C)]
I guess we don’t need to worry about turning it\ninto a thriving business.\c\nAZ did tell us he saw it more as his own final\nresidence than anything.[VAR 0114(0006)]
We probably don’t need to worry about turning it\ninto a thriving business, right?\c\nAZ did tell us he saw it more as his own final\nresidence than anything.[VAR 0114(0005)]
He did, yes. But keeping a building like this in\ngood repair won’t be cheap...[VAR 0114(000B)]
Should we ask Vinnie for help? I bet Quasartico\nwould lend a hand.[VAR 0114(000C)]
I wouldn’t want to use our Z-A Royale wish on\nthat. I don’t think it’s what we worked so hard for.[VAR 0114(0006)]
I wouldn’t want to use our Z-A Royale wish on\nthis. I don’t think it’s what we worked so hard for.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Vinnie? What’s up?[VAR 0114(0006)]
Vinnie? What’s up?[VAR 0114(0005)]
You were promised one wish to be granted if you\nachieved Rank A. It’s time we took care of that.\r\nPlease join us on the south side of Centrico Plaza.[VAR 0114(000E)]
Got it. See you at Centrico Plaza.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Understood. See you at Centrico Plaza.[VAR 0114(0005)]
We’ll be waiting for you.[VAR 0114(000E)]
You all heard that, right? It’s time to go meet\nVinnie![VAR 0114(0006)]
You all heard that, right? It’s time to go meet\nVinnie![VAR 0114(0005)]
Guess you’ve got until you reach Centrico Plaza\nto figure out what you want to ask for![VAR 0114(000C)]
I’m still not sure...
I’ll figure it out
I suspect everyone’s quite curious to see what\nour two A-ranked Trainers will request.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Yeah, probably, but no use getting nervous about\nit. Let’s get to Centrico Plaza![VAR 0114(0006)]
You’re probably right, but there’s no point getting\nnervous about it. Let’s head to Centrico Plaza![VAR 0114(0005)]
C’mon, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0006)]
Let’s go, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0005)]
[~ 62]
My dear Team MZ![VAR 0114(0015)]
Buh?[VAR 0114(0006)]
Why are you here?![VAR 0114(0005)]
We simply had to find out what both of you\nA-ranked Trainers would wish for...[VAR 0114(0011)]
The bottom line is this: I would love nothing more\nthan the opportunity to battle all of you again![VAR 0114(0015)]
Then why not just ask us to battle like Trainers\nnormally do?[VAR 0114(000B)]
I am so glad you asked!\c\nMy dream is to help every resident of Lumiose\nbecome the best Trainer they can be.[VAR 0114(0015)]
And my dream is to make the citizens of Lumiose\nstrong so that we can get rid of wild zones![VAR 0114(0011)]
Oh dear... I would never have expected to share a\ndream with someone like you.[VAR 0114(0015)]
Nevertheless, I certainly would not object if you\nfelt inclined to ask on my behalf for a tournament\r\nthat is open to every Trainer in Lumiose!\c\nAs for the name, how about something like...\nLe Sublime-Ultra-Tournoi de Jacinthe![VAR 0114(0015)]
At that point, would you even call it a\ntournament?[VAR 0114(000C)]
I’m not even gonna touch this conversation!\nVinnie’s waiting. Let’s go![VAR 0114(0006)]
Oh, whatever! Vinnie’s waiting. Let’s go![VAR 0114(0005)]
Lumiose may have been saved this time, but we\nmust grow ever stronger to head off future crises!\r\nThis is my own personal brand of justice.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Everybody shall compete and become stronger—\nand I shall reign at the top of it all![VAR 0114(0015)]
Hurry to the south side of Centrico Plaza.\nEveryone’s waiting![VAR 0114(000C)]
True strength means training your heart to\nrecognize the right time to use your power.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Once I reach the top, I shall turn Lumiose City\ninto Jacinthe City![VAR 0114(0015)]
[~ 81]
Thank you so much for taking the time to meet\nwith us today, children.[VAR 0114(000D)]
First of all, I offer my most sincere apologies to\nTeam MZ regarding the Prism Tower affair.[VAR 0114(000D)]
It should have been up to Quasartico Inc. to\nresolve the situation, yet it fell to you to rescue\r\nLumiose’s residents—human and Pokémon alike.\r\nWe owe you all a great debt.[VAR 0114(000D)]
Oh, geez—I mean, thank you, but I wouldn’t go\nthat far![VAR 0114(0006)]
R-really, it wasn’t that much![VAR 0114(0005)]
And the Prism Tower thing was no one’s fault!\nIt’s not like you could’ve just told the whole city\r\nsomething was up—it would’ve caused a panic![VAR 0114(0006)]
And the Prism Tower thing was no one’s fault!\nIt’s not like you could’ve just told the whole city\r\nsomething was up—it would’ve caused a panic![VAR 0114(0005)]
It’s just such a shame that AZ’s attempt to protect\nLumiose went so wrong.[VAR 0114(0006)]
It’s just such a shame that AZ’s attempt to protect\nLumiose went so wrong.[VAR 0114(0005)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]But we managed to right it—with the help of all\nthose tough Trainers\r\n[VAR 0100(0000)]\r\nhad\r\nbattled![VAR 0114(000C)]
Anyway, I think we would have tried to help out\nno matter what. We love Lumiose, after all.[VAR 0114(000B)]
It does my heart good to hear that you all feel\nthis way.[VAR 0114(000D)]
With that said... Vinnie?[VAR 0114(000D)]
Yes, ma’am.[VAR 0114(000E)]
As you know, reaching Rank A in the Z-A Royale\nearns you the right to have one wish granted.[VAR 0114(000E)]
As long as that wish is within the capability of\nQuasartico Inc. to grant, of course.[VAR 0114(000E)]
What about the person you’ve been searching for,\n[VAR 018B(0001)]? You could get help looking for them?[VAR 0114(000C)]
That’s a personal thing, I guess. I can just find\nthem myself.\c\nA wish this big feels like it should go toward\nsomething that’d help everyone.[VAR 0114(0006)]
That’s a personal thing, I guess. I can just find\nthem myself.\c\nA wish this big feels like it should go toward\nsomething that’d help everyone.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Ooh, I know! We could combine your two wishes!\nI bet that’d get us something REALLY cool![VAR 0114(000C)]
They’re the ones with the wishes, you know.[VAR 0114(000B)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]In that case...what do you say,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0006)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]In that case...what do you say,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0005)]
I want us all to battle Pokémon together!
I want us to live in harmony with Pokémon!
I want more Pokémon to live in Lumiose!
I feel you, but that’s Quasartico’s whole mission.\nWe can leave that up to them![VAR 0114(000C)]
We’ve already made Centrico Plaza into our new\nWild Zone 20, allowing Pokémon to settle there.\c\nI’m afraid adding even MORE into the city at this\npoint would be...problematic.[VAR 0114(000E)]
That seems like one promising way to make the\ncity as joyful as it can be.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Jacinthe and the others sure seemed hyped about\nthat idea![VAR 0114(000C)]
I’m on board with more Pokémon battles for sure!\nHow about we ask for the Z-A Royale to continue?[VAR 0114(0006)]
I fully support more Pokémon battles! Should we\nask for the Z-A Royale to continue, then?[VAR 0114(0005)]
I see. What an interesting turn of events...[VAR 0114(000E)]
Hm? Something wrong?[VAR 0114(0006)]
What? Is there a problem?[VAR 0114(0005)]
No. Rather, AZ had approached me as well, to ask\nif the Z-A Royale could be continued even after its\r\noriginal purpose had been served.[VAR 0114(000E)]
Perhaps he, better than any other, understood the\nvalue of engaging in Pokémon battles, after such\r\na long life spent watching others...[VAR 0114(000E)]
If you will give me but a moment...[VAR 0114(000E)]
Attention, Z-A Royale operations team.\c\nThis is your green light to push the update to the\napp, as discussed.[VAR 0114(000E)]
Your Z-A Royale app has been updated!
As you’ll see when you next check your app...[VAR 0114(000E)]
you should now be registered to take part in the\n[VAR FF00(0006)]Infinite Z-A Royale[VAR FF00(0000)].[VAR 0114(000E)]
I’ll inform the other Z-A Royale participants about\nthe update and our plans for this competition.[VAR 0114(000E)]
Let me see... I suppose we might as well begin at\nonce. We will kick it off this very night.[VAR 0114(000E)]
Man, you work fast, Vinnie.[VAR 0114(0006)]
You work fast, as always, Vinnie.[VAR 0114(0005)]
So AZ wished for this to happen too...[VAR 0114(000B)]
I wonder if there really are things you can only\nunderstand through Pokémon battles?[VAR 0114(000C)]
We’ll find out through the Z-A Royale!\c\nListen up! Starting now, we’re rivals![VAR 0114(0006)]
We’ll find out what those things are through the\nZ-A Royale!\c\nI hope you’re all ready! Starting now, we’re rivals![VAR 0114(0005)]
It seems a marvelous future awaits us.[VAR 0114(000D)]
As much as we work to improve the city itself, its\npeople and Pokémon are what truly matter most.[VAR 0114(000D)]
I hope the competition sparked by the Z-A Royale\nwill continue breathing new life into Lumiose City.[VAR 0114(000D)]
No time to waste! Let’s get ready—the Infinite Z-A\nRoyale awaits![VAR 0114(0006)]
All right, let’s go do whatever we need to prepare!\nThe Infinite Z-A Royale awaits![VAR 0114(0005)]
I’ll have you know that I won’t only be running\nthe Infinite Z-A Royale. I will also be participating.[VAR 0114(000E)]
[~ 138]
[VAR 0100(0000)]! Thank goodness!\c\nDrop whatever you’re doing and hurry straight\nback to Hotel Z right now! Like, NOW![VAR 0114(000C)]
[~ 140]
We meet again.[VAR 0114(0019)]
I would speak with you about AZ, but words fail\nme. How does one speak fittingly of such a man?[VAR 0114(0019)]
It’s tragic that after seeing so many others to their\nrest, he was alone when his time came...[VAR 0114(0019)]
Still, I am glad for the conversations he and I had,\nhowever scant.[VAR 0114(0019)]
Uh... Excuse me, but...what did you talk to AZ\nabout?[VAR 0114(000C)]
About the agony of being unable to die.[VAR 0114(0019)]
About his deeds, both good and heinous.[VAR 0114(0019)]
Even though it was for the sake of peace, he did\nbuild Ange... Do you consider that a bad deed?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Not necessarily—though the havoc it wreaked on\nLumiose is undeniable.[VAR 0114(0019)]
The exact causality is unclear...but we can\nsurmise that Ange’s influence resulted in more\r\nwild Pokémon gathering throughout Lumiose.[VAR 0114(0019)]
Which led this city—built for humans—to become\na place of harmony with these wild creatures.[VAR 0114(0019)]
But now, we have separated Pokémon and\nhumans into different areas once more...[VAR 0114(0019)]
I wonder... Is it right that we keep each other at\narm’s length with these holo-tech barriers?[VAR 0114(0019)]
Perhaps we will find another way. I look forward\nto seeing what the people of this city choose.[VAR 0114(0019)]
Um... Right. So...[VAR 0114(000C)]
I have, of course, come here to tell you something.\nI’ll get to it.[VAR 0114(0019)]
After you and I spoke in Lysandre Labs, more of\nmy memory returned.[VAR 0114(0019)]
And I recalled the existence of two beings.[VAR 0114(0019)]
The one that gives...and the one that takes.[VAR 0114(0019)]
One that gives?
One that takes?
I wish that I could tell you more.\c\nI am sorry—for now, all I can remember are these\nepithets.[VAR 0114(0019)]
But I have more to tell you. Zygarde has not\nshown itself since that eventful day.[VAR 0114(0019)]
I imagine it exhausted its power and has now\nretreated somewhere to quietly recover.[VAR 0114(0019)]
You understand what that means, do you not?\nThere are none but you on whom I can rely.[VAR 0114(0019)]
That being the situation, I will leave the rest up to\nyou. Please, find the two I spoke of.[VAR 0114(0019)]
What even was that?[VAR 0114(000C)]
It’s like that guy was trying to win a “cryptic old\nman” contest![VAR 0114(000C)]
He didn’t give you much to go on, did he?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Perhaps you could learn more from people with\nconnections to Team Flare?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Got anyone in mind?[VAR 0114(000C)]
Mable at the Pokémon Research Lab and Grisham\nat Nouveau Café, I suppose?[VAR 0114(000B)]
There you go! We’ll be cheering for ya![VAR 0114(000C)]
[~ 174]
Isn’t the Infinite Z-A Royale awesome?[VAR 0114(0006)]
Isn’t the Infinite Z-A Royale great?[VAR 0114(0005)]
I haven’t had a chance for an all-out match with\nyou since we fought to see who’s the strongest\r\nMega Evolution user![VAR 0114(0006)]
I haven’t had a chance for an all-out match with\nyou since we fought to see who’s the strongest\r\nMega Evolution user![VAR 0114(0005)]
Watch me win![VAR 0114(0006)]
Watch me win![VAR 0114(0005)]
[~ 181]
Time to use the power of our bonds with everyone\nin Lumiose...and Mega Evolve![VAR 0114(0006)]
Time to use the power of our bonds with everyone\nin Lumiose...and Mega Evolve![VAR 0114(0005)]
[~ 184]
I know I’ve told you already, but...I’m glad we met.[VAR 0114(0006)]
I’m really glad we met, you know.[VAR 0114(0005)]
I couldn’t have taken on the whole Z-A Royale—\nor protected Lumiose—if you hadn’t been there.[VAR 0114(0006)]
I couldn’t have taken on the whole Z-A Royale—\nor protected Lumiose—if you hadn’t been there.[VAR 0114(0005)]
You received a prize for winning your reward\nmatch!
[VAR 018B(0001)], can I have a word?[VAR 0114(0008)]
Emma? Yeah, sure. Must be pretty important if\nyou came to find me.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Emma? Yeah, sure. Must be pretty important if\nyou came to find me.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Sorry—give me a second here, OK?[VAR 0114(0006)]
Sorry—give us just a second, OK?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Emma, you’re...you’re sure?\c\n...All right.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Emma, you’re...you’re sure?\c\n...All right.[VAR 0114(0005)]
[VAR BD06(0000)][VAR 0100(0000)], come on. We need to\nmake\r\na\r\nstop\r\nat\r\nQuasartico HQ.[VAR 0114(0006)]
[VAR BD06(0000)][VAR 0100(0000)], come on. We need to\nmake\r\na\r\nstop\r\nat\r\nQuasartico HQ.[VAR 0114(0005)]
[~ 199]
Thanks for coming, both of you.[VAR 0114(0008)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Just triple-checking: [VAR 018B(0001)], your\njacket was a\r\nkeepsake from your mom, right?[VAR 0114(0008)]
Yeah.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Yeah, it was.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Well, I’ve found the person who gave it to your\nmom in the first place.[VAR 0114(0008)]
That jacket was a gift from me.[VAR 0114(000D)]
Wha—?[VAR 0114(0006)]
I’m sorry?[VAR 0114(0005)]
[VAR BD06(0000)][VAR 018B(0001)], I’m quite sure that your\nmother...was my\r\ndaughter.[VAR 0114(000D)]
Your mother worked to develop hologram\ntechnology, did she not?[VAR 0114(000D)]
Yes, she did...[VAR 0114(0006)]
That’s right...[VAR 0114(0005)]
Your mother and I...\c\nWe disagreed over the direction in which this\ncompany was moving. She left, saying that she\r\nhad her own research she wished to pursue.[VAR 0114(000D)]
Yeah. She worked hard at her research, all while\ncaring for me when I was just a kid. It was tough.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Yes. She worked hard at that research, all while\ncaring for me when I was just a kid.\c\nIt was a lot for her to handle on her own...[VAR 0114(0005)]
I think she ended up doing work for Team Flare...\nor maybe getting support from Lysandre.[VAR 0114(0006)]
I think she ended up doing work for Team Flare...\nor maybe getting support from Lysandre.[VAR 0114(0005)]
It is true that your mother’s research contributed\nto the invention of Team Flare’s hologram devices.\c\nThat very same research enabled us to develop\nour own holo-tech here at Quasartico Inc.[VAR 0114(000D)]
Even though she chose to walk a separate path,\nstill we find these points of intersection...\c\nLife truly is curious at times.[VAR 0114(000D)]
So Mom’s hard work helped make the wild zones\nand everything possible...[VAR 0114(0006)]
So Mom’s hard work helped make the wild zones\nand everything possible...[VAR 0114(0005)]
But she burned herself out doing all that.\c\nIn the end, she had to go to some faraway region\nto try and rest.[VAR 0114(0006)]
But she burned herself out doing all that.\c\nIn the end, she had to go to some faraway region\nto try and rest.[VAR 0114(0005)]
I see... And I suppose that is where she...[VAR 0114(000D)]
...Yeah.[VAR 0114(0006)]
...Yeah.[VAR 0114(0005)]
I knew my mom had ties to Lumiose, so I figured\nI’d find you—or someone who knew her—here.[VAR 0114(0006)]
I knew my mom had ties to Lumiose, so I figured\nI’d find you—or someone who knew her—here.[VAR 0114(0005)]
But of course our family was not originally from\nLumiose City.[VAR 0114(000D)]
That’s why it was a struggle to find any leads...[VAR 0114(0008)]
Until I noticed that jacket.\c\nI couldn’t be sure at first—it has certainly seen\nsome hard days since I’d last seen it, and of\r\ncourse you’ve added some flair of your own...[VAR 0114(000D)]
That’s what prompted President Jett to enlist me\nto do some sleuthing for her, too.[VAR 0114(0008)]
At that moment, it struck me.\c\nWhat if President Jett and [VAR 018B(0001)] are related to—\nand searching for—one another?[VAR 0114(0008)]
My daughter—your mother... Did she ever speak\nabout me?[VAR 0114(000D)]
She regretted never talking to you again after\nshe left.\c\nAnd she said if I ever met you, I should tell you\nsomething:[VAR 0114(0006)]
She regretted never talking to you again after\nshe left.\c\nAnd she said if I ever met you, I should tell you\nsomething:[VAR 0114(0005)]
Even though you and she walked different paths,\nthere was still so much you had in common.\c\nNoticing what you shared made her life feel fuller,\neven after she left. Maybe especially after.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Even though you and she walked different paths,\nthere was still so much you had in common.\c\nNoticing what you shared made her life feel fuller,\neven after she left. Maybe especially after.[VAR 0114(0005)]
If only I’d been less stubborn... If only I’d tried to\nreach back across that divide sooner...[VAR 0114(000D)]
Please...don’t be too hard on yourself. She’d be\nglad to know her message reached you, at least.[VAR 0114(0006)]
I...I think it’s all right. She’d be glad to know her\nmessage reached you, at least.[VAR 0114(0005)]
I must ask one thing of you, [VAR 018B(0001)].[VAR 0114(000D)]
I bear a responsibility for Quasartico Inc. choosing\nto conceal the truth about the tower’s threat from\r\nthe public for so long.\c\nAnd so I plan to step down as president.[VAR 0114(000D)]
But the urban redevelopment plan must continue.\c\nWe must make Lumiose City into a place that\ntruly belongs to both people and Pokémon.\c\nHaving some continuity in the project’s leadership\ncould help the transition go a little smoother.\c\nPerhaps...if someone who had been helping\nalready were to step into my shoes—someone\r\nwho is already a leader in their own right...[VAR 0114(000D)]
Wait—are you...are you saying what I think you’re\nsaying?\c\nYou want ME to take your place leading\nQuasartico?![VAR 0114(0006)]
Wait—you’re not saying what I think you’re\nsaying...are you?\c\nYou want...ME to take over as CEO of Quasartico?![VAR 0114(0005)]
I don’t know...I mean, I guess that’d be keeping\nthings in the family, but...we only just met...[VAR 0114(0006)]
Me...leading the whole company? I mean, I guess\nit makes some sense to keep it in the family, but...[VAR 0114(0005)]
You know what? Sure. I think Mom wouldn’t\nwant me to say no.[VAR 0114(0006)]
You know what? All right. I doubt Mom would\nhave wanted me to refuse.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Hey...you get why I have to do this, right?[VAR 0114(0006)]
You understand why I have to do this, right?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Of course I get it
But...Team MZ...
Thank you. I mean it—you’re the best.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Thank you so much![VAR 0114(0005)]
Please don’t say that. It’ll just make this harder.[VAR 0114(0006)]
I... Thank you. I’m happy to know you’ll miss\nhaving me around.\c\nAnd I hope you know...I wouldn’t leave unless it\nwere really that important.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Hey, Floette?[VAR 0114(0006)]
Hey, Floette?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Kyururu.
You were listening, right?\c\nI’m gonna be really busy for a while. I probably\nwon’t have time to be a good Pokémon Trainer.[VAR 0114(0006)]
You were listening, right?\c\nI’m gonna be really busy for a while. I probably\nwon’t have time to be a good Pokémon Trainer.[VAR 0114(0005)]
So...you should do like AZ would’ve wanted. Help\n[VAR 0100(0000)] keep Lumiose safe.[VAR 0114(0006)]
So...you should do like AZ would’ve wanted. Help\n[VAR 0100(0000)] keep Lumiose safe.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Kyururu...
Kyuru!
Thanks, Floette.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Thanks, Floette.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Wait, your Boxes are full? Seriously?!\c\nPlease, clear some space so we don’t have to\ndraw this out![VAR 0114(0006)]
Hang on—your Boxes are completely full?! Give\nme a break... Make some space, would you?[VAR 0114(0005)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Here. Make good use of this,\n[VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0006)]
Here. Use this well, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0005)]
[VAR 0100(0000)]...\c\nI’m so sorry to break up your team this way.[VAR 0114(000D)]
It’s all right. Even if we’re apart for a little while,\nwe’ll always be Team MZ.[VAR 0114(0006)]
It’s all right. Even if we’re apart for a little while,\nwe’ll always be Team MZ.[VAR 0114(0005)]
I’ll come say what I need to later, but...could you\nbreak the news to Lida and Naveen?[VAR 0114(0006)]
I’ll come give them the whole story later, but...\ncould you break the news to Lida and Naveen?[VAR 0114(0005)]
I’ll whip up an extra-special croissant curry to\nmake it up to all of you, I promise![VAR 0114(0006)]
I’ll whip up an extra-special croissant curry to\nmake it up to all of you, I promise![VAR 0114(0005)]
Let’s all keep doing what we can to make\nLumiose the best place it can be![VAR 0114(0006)]
Let’s all keep doing what we can to make\nLumiose the best place it can be![VAR 0114(0005)]
[~ 282]
Greedy little IMBECILE![VAR 0114(0007)]
Throwing even MORE budget at the wild zones,\nbecause now they’re a hit with the tourists?!\c\nWe can’t handle that without more funding! This\nidiot mayor is going to be the death of me![VAR 0114(0007)]
Sure, things with Prism Tower have calmed down\nat last...[VAR 0114(0007)]
But that doesn’t mean there aren’t other threats\nto Lumiose! The signs are all there![VAR 0114(0007)]
[~ 287]
Well, look who’s here! The finest researcher in\nthe entire Mable stable.[VAR 0114(0007)]
You must have something pretty annoying to ask\nme if you’ve come all the way to my office, right?[VAR 0114(0007)]
Well, Lysandre DID mention something...
Something about...ones giving and taking?
Here we go again. Even after years on the straight\nand narrow, I still can’t escape my past.\c\nAll right. I guess I can’t avoid it forever, so I’m just\ngonna go ahead and tell you what I know.[VAR 0114(0007)]
There’s a pair of Legendary Pokémon in the Kalos\nregion.\c\nThe one that takes—otherwise known as Yveltal.\nAnd the one that gives—usually called Xerneas.[VAR 0114(0007)]
I know quite a bit about the two, since Team Flare\ntried its hand at capturing them both.[VAR 0114(0007)]
Listen. I’m about to share something important,\nso I need you to pay attention here, kid.\c\nWe’ve been getting some strange readings lately\nfrom the wild zones around town.[VAR 0114(0007)]
If I had to posit a theory, I’d say it’s almost like the\nareas have been bathed in Xerneas’s life energy.[VAR 0114(0007)]
And in every wild zone where we’ve detected\nthese weird readings, we’ve seen a certain kind of\r\nPokémon appearing without fail.[VAR 0114(0007)]
They’re alpha Pokémon—but not the usual kind.\nSomething’s not right about them.[VAR 0114(0007)]
These anomalous alphas have to be connected\nsomehow to Xerneas—to the one that gives.\c\nAnd even if they aren’t, I guess we still ought to\ntake care of them. Alphas always spell danger.[VAR 0114(0007)]
I’m sure you can tell where this is going, right?[VAR 0114(0007)]
Your new research task is to catch or defeat the\nanomalous alphas in Wild Zones 3, 5, and 9!\c\nNow get to it![VAR 0114(0007)]
[~ 302]
You haven’t yet surveyed all the anomalous\nalphas I asked you to look into, have you?[VAR 0114(0007)]
Need a reminder of where to look?[VAR 0114(0007)]
Yeah, please tell me
I’ll track ’em down
That’s the spirit! Go get ’em, my number-one\nresearch lackey![VAR 0114(0007)]
Looks like there’s still anomalous alpha\nactivity in...[VAR 0114(0007)]
Wild Zone 3![VAR 0114(0007)]
Wild Zone 5![VAR 0114(0007)]
Wild Zone 9![VAR 0114(0007)]
Go on and catch or defeat every last anomalous\nalpha Pokémon![VAR 0114(0007)]
And here’s my little star researcher![VAR 0114(0007)]
See, tackling my tasks has trained you up to\nhandle just about anything, wouldn’t you say?[VAR 0114(0007)]
Now then, looking at the data you collected...[VAR 0114(0007)]
we’re basically headed for disaster![VAR 0114(0007)]
Xerneas, the one that gives life, is beyond a doubt\ndrawing close to Lumiose City.[VAR 0114(0007)]
We can probably infer that the crisis with the\ntower triggered this behavior.[VAR 0114(0007)]
The excessive Mega Power from the tower caused\nRogue Mega Evolution, and if Xerneas shows up,\r\nsomething similar could happen again.[VAR 0114(0007)]
I mean, it has command of basically an unlimited\npool of life energy![VAR 0114(0007)]
There’s only one way to make sure we avoid\nanother disaster.[VAR 0114(0007)]
Xerneas must be caught![VAR 0114(0007)]
It looks on track to appear in Wild Zone 11.[VAR 0114(0007)]
And once it appears there, it’ll be a problem for\nsome outstanding Trainer to deal with!\c\nBy which I obviously mean you, not me![VAR 0114(0007)]
Xerneas should appear in Wild Zone 11. It’s all up\nto you to catch it, superstar.[VAR 0114(0007)]
[~ 326]

[~ 328]
Looks like you’ve made contact with our target.[VAR 0114(0007)]
You’re up against Xerneas, one of the Legendary\nPokémon of the Kalos region.[VAR 0114(0007)]
We need you to catch that thing![VAR 0114(0007)]
Make sure you’ve got space in your Boxes before\nyou start your battle with Xerneas!
Xsaaaaaah!
[~ 334]
No surprise that a Pokémon with power over life\nitself wouldn’t go down easy...\c\nBut then again, the goal is only to catch it, not to\nsuccessfully defeat it.[VAR 0114(0007)]
Need a boost? I can be your cheer squad.\c\nWho’s got that flair? Team Flare!\nYeah, we’ve got that flair! Team Flare![VAR 0114(0007)]
[~ 337]
Sheesh, kid, that really was impressive.[VAR 0114(0007)]
But don’t forget that Xerneas has power over life\nitself.\c\nIt’ll recover in no time, so hurry up and catch it\nbefore it causes us even more trouble![VAR 0114(0007)]
[~ 340]
Ding-ding-ding! You sure did it![VAR 0114(0007)]
And to the victor go the spoils, meaning...\nCongrats! You got yourself a Legendary Pokémon![VAR 0114(0007)]
Seriously, great work.[VAR 0114(0007)]
When we found Xerneas five years ago, it was\nbasically dormant in a tree-like state.\c\nIt was a lot easier to secure like that, compared to\nwhat you just had to do.[VAR 0114(0007)]
But even then, you could feel the life force just\nroiling around it.\c\nI’d been researching Pokémon’s life energy for\nages, and I was still overwhelmed by that feeling.[VAR 0114(0007)]
Seeing Xerneas again, after all this time... It’s\nquite something.[VAR 0114(0007)]
But look at me! Still stuck here, forbidden from\ntraveling about freely or leaving Lumiose!\c\nThen there was all that mess with energy leaking\nfrom the tower and powering up wild Pokémon...\c\nThat energy’s probably even what caused all these\nwild Pokémon to flock to the city, wanting a taste.\c\nIn short, things have been rough.[VAR 0114(0007)]
But somehow, we’ve managed to prevent even\nmore trouble from befalling the Pokémon here...\c\nLooking at it that way, it’s nice to know that my\nwork for Team Flare wasn’t a total waste.[VAR 0114(0007)]
And you’ve pulled off every last research task I\nhad for you.\c\nGuess this is probably the end of our partnership,\nbut it’s been fun. So, thanks, kid.\c\nHope I’ll be seeing you around.[VAR 0114(0007)]
And you still haven’t finished all the research\ntasks I wanted you to do for me, either!\c\nSo maybe you can take a breather today, but I’m\nstill counting on you to get that work done![VAR 0114(0007)]
[~ 351]
The only good thing we’ve got to offer is our\nlocation. You here for another nasty drink?[VAR 0114(0018)]
Griselle. I do wish you wouldn’t be quite so\ncandid in your sales pitch.[VAR 0114(0017)]
What? We saved the whole dang city with h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]imer.\nYou think we still need to stand on ceremony?[VAR 0114(0018)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]So what d’you want today? The same old\n[VAR 01CF(0002)]?[VAR 0114(0018)]
I want the one that gives
I want the one that takes
Ah. You speak of the Legendary Pokémon, Yveltal\nand Xerneas.[VAR 0114(0017)]
Ugh. Never thought I’d have to hear those names\nagain.\c\nThanks for yet another reminder of all the ways\nwe messed up back in our Team Flare days![VAR 0114(0018)]
If you’re facing either of those two, we’ll help out.\nI hate the aftertaste of failure![VAR 0114(0018)]
Indeed. But if you aim to take on a Legendary\nPokémon, I think it would be wise to reach out to\r\nthe good people of Quasartico first.[VAR 0114(0017)]
Meet us at the Quasartico Inc. building.\c\nDiscussing this further without them won’t get\nus anywhere, believe me.[VAR 0114(0017)]
We haven’t yet hit our sales quota for today, but\nI guess this’ll just be another day in the red.\c\nGo on ahead. We’ll meet you at Quasartico as\nsoon as we close up shop.[VAR 0114(0018)]
[~ 364]
Here you are. We’d heard from Grisham that we\nshould be expecting you.[VAR 0114(000E)]
And I have an update of my own.\c\nOur teams recently detected some sort of flying\nobject approaching Lumiose City.[VAR 0114(000E)]
We have since determined that this “object” is\nmost likely the Legendary Pokémon Yveltal.[VAR 0114(000E)]
Yveltal is a real nasty piece of work.\c\nIt nearly took out a whole Team Flare unit on its\nown, back when we tried to capture it to use for\r\nthe ultimate weapon.[VAR 0114(0018)]
And that was when it was in its DORMANT state,\nmind you.[VAR 0114(0018)]
We did finally manage to contain it, thanks to the\nefforts of the very best Trainers that Team Flare\r\nhad to offer—including our former admin Malva.[VAR 0114(0017)]
If our forces hadn’t been so depleted by that\nfoolish campaign, I doubt those children would\r\nhave ever reached the ultimate weapon to stop it...[VAR 0114(0017)]
This time, Quasartico Inc. will be stepping in to\nhelp so you don’t end up similarly overwhelmed.[VAR 0114(000E)]
What kind of help, Vinnie?
What’s Quasartico got to do with it?
You see, Team Flare had a device that they used to\ntrain some of their team members.[VAR 0114(000E)]
It was a battle simulator that could fully re-create\nPokémon using holo-tech, down to the details of\r\nhow they moved and the effects of their attacks.[VAR 0114(000E)]
Grisham and Griselle here had both experienced\nit for themselves, so we asked for their input...\r\nand built ourselves an improved version.[VAR 0114(000E)]
Yes, we’d had to train against such a device back\nthen as Team Flare’s future leaders.[VAR 0114(0017)]
But the monstrosity Quasartico’s made is even\nworse than what Team Flare had come up with.[VAR 0114(0018)]
Making it the perfect tool with which to train for\na great challenge such as this.[VAR 0114(000E)]
[VAR BD06(0000)][VAR 0100(0000)]. I would like to ask\nyou\r\nto\r\nbattle\r\nonce\r\nmore\r\nagainst\r\nVictreebel,\r\nHawlucha,\r\nand\r\nTyranitar\r\nin\r\ntheir\r\nRogue\r\nMega-Evolved states.[VAR 0114(000E)]
The device is kept in the lower levels. We call it\nour Rogue Mega Evolution Simulator 3000.\c\nIf you’ll follow me, please...[VAR 0114(000E)]
Are you ready to train using the Rogue Mega\nEvolution simulator?[VAR 0114(000E)]
Let’s do this
Maybe later
Then let me escort you down to the training room.[VAR 0114(000E)]
Understood.[VAR 0114(000E)]
[~ 388]
We can set you up to battle against the Rogue\nMega Evolution simulator from here.[VAR 0114(000E)]
Which Rogue Mega Evolution simulation would\nyou like to battle?[VAR 0114(000E)]
I’ll battle Victreebel
I’ll battle Hawlucha
I’ll battle Tyranitar
I need to prepare
Very good. Then I wish you the best of luck in\nyour battle against it.[VAR 0114(000E)]
I have no doubt that you of all people can do this.[VAR 0114(0017)]
I bet they turned the difficulty setting up to max\nwhen I did it, since I’m so strong already.[VAR 0114(0018)]
A resounding victory!\c\nI’d expected no less of you, of course. Which\nPokémon would you like to take on next?[VAR 0114(000E)]
A resounding victory!\c\nI’d expected no less of you, of course. And now\nthere is only one Pokémon remaining.[VAR 0114(000E)]
[~ 400]
It is always difficult to accept such a result, but\nconsider this another learning experience.[VAR 0114(000E)]
We will be here and ready whenever you wish to\ntry again.[VAR 0114(000E)]
[~ 403]
Superbly done. As was to be expected from one of\nour first-ever Z-A Royale champions.[VAR 0114(000E)]
[~ 405]
You are truly impressive, to have so soundly\ndefeated three Rogue Mega-Evolved Pokémon\r\non your own—even if they were simulations.[VAR 0114(000E)]
I guess it was pretty impressive.[VAR 0114(0018)]
Yes? What is it?[VAR 0114(000E)]
Understood.[VAR 0114(000E)]
So the flying object we believe to be Yveltal has\nfinally reached the borders of Lumiose City...[VAR 0114(000E)]
Please notify nearby residents. Civilians should be\nput on alert.[VAR 0114(000E)]
I suppose you overheard all that you needed to.\nYveltal has arrived.[VAR 0114(000E)]
It appears to be headed for the roof of the Rouge\nDistrict’s Galerie de la Lune.[VAR 0114(000E)]
Yveltal is said to be able to absorb life force. It\nrepresents death itself.[VAR 0114(0017)]
Meaning that simply defeating it in battle won’t\nbe enough—it’ll just recover and fly into a rage.\r\nYou absolutely HAVE to catch it to control it![VAR 0114(0018)]
This will be a dangerous battle, but I have every\nfaith in your ability.[VAR 0114(000E)]
You will be fine. I can say so with confidence,\nhaving also faced off against you in battle.[VAR 0114(0017)]
You better do good, or my hand might just slip\nand dump a cup of hot coffee over your head.[VAR 0114(0018)]
[~ 419]

[~ 421]
We’ve detected Yveltal’s life force. I suppose you\nmust have found it![VAR 0114(0017)]
Yveltal is an extremely dangerous Pokémon. I\ntrust you will take care.[VAR 0114(0017)]
And you know you’ve got to catch it! Right?![VAR 0114(0018)]
It’s a big job, but you ought to be up to it![VAR 0114(0018)]
Make sure you’ve got space in your Boxes before\nyou start your battle with Yveltal!
Yvaaaaaar!!!
[~ 428]
Come, let’s try once again. Prepare yourself to be\nbetter able to catch Yveltal.[VAR 0114(0017)]
We can’t let it start running wild! Hurry up and\ncatch that thing for ALL our sakes![VAR 0114(0018)]
[~ 431]
That was a truly impressive victory, but none of us\nwill be able to rest easy unless you catch it.[VAR 0114(0017)]
We can’t let it start running wild! Hurry up and\ncatch that thing for ALL our sakes![VAR 0114(0018)]
[~ 434]
You never stop surprising me. To think that you\nwould be able to conquer even Yveltal...[VAR 0114(0017)]
I just wanted to protect Lumiose
I’m kind of surprised myself!
Perhaps it’s true that wanting something too\nmuch clouds the vision, sending one down paths\r\nthat lead only to defeat.[VAR 0114(0017)]
What’re you going on about now, Gris?[VAR 0114(0018)]
Ah... Nothing. Nothing at all.[VAR 0114(0017)]
I was just thinking how wonderful it would be to\nhave a serious battle against our friend here, who\r\nhas subdued Lumiose’s mightiest Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0017)]
Seriously... If there’s a point here, would you mind\ngetting to it?[VAR 0114(0018)]
My point is only that my old fixation upon\nrestoring our honor held me captive to the past.\c\nAnd now I am focused wholly on becoming the\ngreatest I can be. A better goal, I rather think.[VAR 0114(0017)]
Yeah, I guess. Nothing wrong with that, huh?\c\nI prefer the look you get on your face when you’re\nfocused in battle. You almost look good.[VAR 0114(0018)]
I think I also maintain a nice expression when I\nam dealing with our customers.[VAR 0114(0017)]
Speaking of which, are we all ready for a nice\ncoffee break?[VAR 0114(0017)]
All right, one piping hot cup full of props to you!\nI swear it’s not just dregs we couldn’t sell today.[VAR 0114(0018)]
[~ 448]
A being that gives, and a being that takes...
Both actions are vital to maintaining balance. But\nin excess, either could destroy it.[VAR 0114(0019)]
My memories remain vague—indistinct—yet there\nis one thing I know:\c\nLong ago, I tried to give too much.[VAR 0114(0019)]
But my good deeds saw no reward. I wallowed in\ndespair, in resentment...and I decided to take\r\neverything for myself instead![VAR 0114(0019)]
Then came Zygarde. A being that seeks to correct\nexcess—to find moderation, to restore balance.[VAR 0114(0019)]
I can only imagine that is why it would save me—\nthe one who’d fired the ultimate weapon.[VAR 0114(0019)]
And now I must ask something of you.[VAR 0114(0019)]
Battle me, so that I may see who you truly are as a\nTrainer.[VAR 0114(0019)]
[~ 457]
Are you prepared to battle me?[VAR 0114(0019)]
Let’s battle
Not quite...
Then I will wait.[VAR 0114(0019)]
I once believed that victory was the only meaning\nto be found from battle...[VAR 0114(0019)]
but I am certain that I will enjoy battling you![VAR 0114(0019)]
[~ 464]
Look at how we cooperate, human and Pokémon.\nPerhaps there is a beauty to this world.[VAR 0114(0019)]
[~ 466]
This is why we battle—to reach understanding.\nTrainer to Trainer, Trainer to Pokémon, and\r\nPokémon to Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0019)]
I suppose that is why AZ, like you, wished for the\nZ-A Royale to resume.[VAR 0114(0019)]
Five years ago, a group of children stood against\nme in defiance.\c\nIf I’d tried to understand them...perhaps I would\nnever have fired the ultimate weapon.[VAR 0114(0019)]
Zeh.
Zygarde...[VAR 0114(0019)]
How curious.[VAR 0114(0019)]
I believe it meant to beckon you to the tower.[VAR 0114(0019)]
That much is what I can intuit from my experience\nworking with Zygarde...[VAR 0114(0019)]
What it wants with you at that fateful place, I\ncannot say.[VAR 0114(0019)]
[~ 476]
Make sure you’ve got space in your Boxes before\nyou start your battle with Zygarde!
Will you battle Zygarde?
I’m ready for this!
I need to prepare
Zeeehhhd!
[~ 482]
So this Legendary Pokémon has joined forces\nwith the mightiest Trainer in Lumiose.[VAR 0114(0019)]
The thought of you two combining your power\ngives me hope for the future of this city.[VAR 0114(0019)]
You should have this. It will allow Zygarde to\nchange its form.[VAR 0114(0019)]
When Zygarde used up its strength protecting\nPokémon from the light of the ultimate weapon...\c\nits parts scattered to far-off places, absorbing the\npower of those lands and seeking humans who\r\nwould give it aid.[VAR 0114(0019)]
And now that I think of it...\c\nThe moves that Zygarde used when it Mega\nEvolved—they reminded me of Z-Moves, like those\r\nused in the Alola region.\c\nBut perhaps I am reading too much into it.[VAR 0114(0019)]
Now, it falls to me to ponder...what should I do\nwith the three thousand years I must live?[VAR 0114(0019)]
Is there something you want to do?
I honestly have no idea...
There is.[VAR 0114(0019)]
That’s only fair. It is not an answer I will find in\nanyone but my own self. But I know one thing.[VAR 0114(0019)]
To this day, I yearn to create a more beautiful\nworld...and I will yearn for it forever![VAR 0114(0019)]
I once thought that we could achieve that world\nby fulfilling the material needs of everyone.\c\nNow I know it is not so simple.[VAR 0114(0019)]
An old proverb says it is good to feed the hungry,\nbut better to teach them how to feed themselves.\c\nI had focused solely on what I believed the world\nneeded. Yet I lost sight of how to make it so that\r\npeople can truly flourish.[VAR 0114(0019)]
Thanks to what you and your Pokémon have done\ntogether, I have learned my lesson well.[VAR 0114(0019)]
It is an outlandish dream, far beyond my reach...\nbut with three thousand years’ time, perhaps I\r\ncan make it real.[VAR 0114(0019)]
Much like AZ wandered far and wide across the\nworld in search of Floette...[VAR 0114(0019)]
I shall travel across vast reaches in search of ways\nto create the world I yearn for.[VAR 0114(0019)]
When people manage to meet, it is a gift. Even\nliving in the same time and place is no guarantee.\c\nThe fact that we, and so many others, met and\nbanded together to make Lumiose a better place...\r\nis something we should treasure.[VAR 0114(0019)]
Barring some great change, I doubt we will meet\nagain...but I will carry these lessons with me.\c\nAu revoir, my young friend.[VAR 0114(0019)]

[VAR BD06(0000)]Oh, [VAR 0100(0000)]! I meant\nto\r\nask\r\nbefore...\c\nWould you like to register your birthday with us?
Now, do be careful that you enter it right. You\ncan’t change your birthday after it’s registered.
So your birthday is [VAR 0201(0001)]/[VAR 0201(0002)], right? Mind that the\nmonth is the first number!
That’s right!
Let me change it
Never mind
Thanks for registering your birthday with the\nPokémon Center!
You should stop by on your big day, too!\nWe’ll be expecting you on [VAR 0201(0001)]/[VAR 0201(0002)]!
Oh, and if your very special birthday isn’t on the\ncalendar this year, then please come on 2/28!
You can register your birthday at any time, so just\nsay the word if you change your mind!
Come back and see us again whenever you need!
Hold on... You said [VAR 0201(0001)]/[VAR 0201(0002)], right? Is that...? Hm?!\c\nThat’s today! OK, give me a second while I get\neverything ready!
Hold on... You said [VAR 0201(0001)]/[VAR 0201(0002)], right? Is that...? Hm?!\c\nToday is 2/28! So we should celebrate your\nbirthday today, shouldn’t we?\c\nOK, give me a second while I get everything ready!
[~ 48]
Joyeux anniversaire! We wish you a happy\nbirthday, [VAR 0100(0000)]!
Oh, today is a bit special, isn’t it?\c\nI know it’s a day early, but we wish you a joyeux\nanniversaire! Have a happy birthday tomorrow!
I do hope this will be a wonderful year for you—\neach and every day!
First, let’s restore your Pokémon to full health.
Be sure to visit a Pokémon Center whenever your\nPokémon [VAR 1101(00FD,0302)]isare running low on HP.\r\nOr at least stock up on plenty of our Potions!\c\nGood luck out there, Trainer!
Your Pokémon should be all better now!
It’s dangerous to take too many hits from wild\nPokémon!\c\nBe sure to retreat to safety and take time to\nrecover if you’re attacked.
You have no more Pokémon that can fight...
Be sure to check your team and the moves they\ncan use to ensure your victory next time!
I want to battle you
Your Pokémon is already perfectly healthy!
Your Pokémon are already perfectly healthy!
