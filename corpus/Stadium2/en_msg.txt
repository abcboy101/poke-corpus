The seed on its back is filled with\nnutrients. The seed grows steadily larger\nas its body grows.
Exposure to sunlight adds to its strength.\nSunlight also makes the bud on its back\ngrow larger.
By spreading the broad petals of its\nflower and catching the sun's rays, it fills\nits body with power.
The flame on its tail shows the strength\nof its life force. If it is weak, the flame\nalso burns weakly.
It is very hot-headed by nature, so it\nconstantly seeks opponents. It calms down\nonly when it wins.
If CHARIZARD becomes furious, the flame\nat the tip of its tail flares up in a\nwhitish-blue color.
The shell is soft when it is born. It soon\nbecomes so resilient, prodding fingers will\nbounce off it.
It is recognized as a symbol of longevity.\nIf its shell has algae on it, that\nWARTORTLE is very old.
It deliberately makes itself heavy so it\ncan withstand the recoil of the water\njets it fires.
For protection, it releases a horrible\nstench from the antenna on its head to\ndrive away enemies.
Inside the shell, it is soft and weak as it\nprepares to evolve. It stays motionless in\nthe shell.
It collects honey every day. It rubs honey\nonto the hairs on its legs to carry it back\nto its nest.
Its poison stinger is very powerful. Its\nbright-colored body is intended to warn\noff its enemies.
Although it is a cocoon, it can move a\nlittle. It can extend its poison barb if it\nis attacked.
It can take down any opponent with its\npowerful poison stingers. It sometimes\nattacks in swarms.
It usually hides in tall grass. Because it\ndislikes fighting, it protects itself by\nkicking up sand.
It has outstanding vision. However high it\nflies, it is able to distinguish the\nmovements of its prey.
Its well-developed chest muscles make it\nstrong enough to whip up a gusty\nwindstorm with just a few flaps.
It eats anything. Wherever food is\navailable, it will settle down and produce\noffspring continuously.
Gnaws on anything with its tough fangs. It\ncan even topple concrete buildings by\ngnawing on them.
It flaps its short wings to flush out\ninsects from tall grass. It then plucks\nthem with its stubby beak.
It shoots itself suddenly high into the\nsky, then plummets down in one fell swoop\nto strike its prey.
It can freely detach its jaw to swallow\nlarge prey whole. It can become too heavy\nto move, however.
Transfixing prey with the face-like\npattern on its belly, it binds and poisons\nthe frightened victim.
This intelligent POKéMON roasts hard\nBERRIES with electricity to make them\ntender enough to eat.
When its electricity builds, its muscles are\nstimulated, and it becomes more aggressive\nthan usual.
If it fell from a great height, this\nPOKéMON could save itself by rolling into\na ball and bouncing.
In an attempt to hide itself, it will run\naround at top speed to kick up a blinding\ndust storm.
The poison hidden in its small horn is\nextremely potent. Even a tiny scratch can\nhave fatal results.
When feeding its young, it first chews and\ntenderizes the food, then spits it out for\nthe offspring.
Its body is covered with needle-like\nscales. It never shows signs of shrinking\nfrom any attack.
It is small, but its horn is filled with\npoison. It charges then stabs with the\nhorn to inject poison.
It raises its big ears to check its\nsurroundings. If it senses anything, it\nattacks immediately.
It swings its big tail around during battle.\nIf its foe flinches, it will charge with its\nsturdy body.
The moonlight that it stores in the wings\non its back apparently gives it the ability\nto float in midair.
With its acute hearing, it can pick up\nsounds from far away. It usually hides in\nquiet places.
As it develops, its single white tail gains\ncolor and splits into six. It is quite warm\nand cuddly.
Some legends claim that each of its nine\ntails has its own unique type of special\nmystical power.
If it inflates to SING a lullaby, it can\nperform longer and cause sure drowsiness \nin its audience.
Their fur feels so good that if\ntwo of them snuggle together,\nthey won't want to be separated.
While flying, it constantly emits ultrasonic\nwaves from its mouth to check its\nsurroundings.
However hard its victim's hide may be, it\npunctures with sharp fangs and gorges\nitself with blood.
Awakened by moonlight, it roams actively\nat night. In the day, it stays quietly\nunderground.
What appears to be drool is actually sweet\nhoney. It is very sticky and clings\nstubbornly if touched.
It has the world's largest petals. With\nevery step, the petals shake out heavy\nclouds of toxic pollen.
It is doused with mushroom spores when it\nis born. As its body grows, mushrooms\nsprout from its back.
It stays mostly in dark, damp places, the\npreference not of the bug, but of the big\nmushrooms on its back.
Its eyes also function as radar units. It\ncatches and eats small bugs that hide in\ndarkness.
When it attacks, it flaps its large wings\nviolently to scatter its poisonous powder\nall around.
Its skin is very thin. If it is exposed to\nlight, its blood heats up, causing it to\ngrow weak.
Its three heads bob separately up and\ndown to loosen the soil nearby, making it\neasier for it to burrow.
It is fascinated by round objects. It\ncan't stop playing with them until it tires\nand falls asleep.
Many adore it for its sophisticated air.\nHowever, it will lash out and scratch for\nlittle reason.
It has mystical powers but doesn't recall\nthat it has used them. That is why it\nalways looks puzzled.
When it swims at full speed using its long,\nwebbed limbs, its forehead somehow begins\nto glow.
It is extremely ill-tempered. Groups of\nthem will attack any handy target for no\nreason.
If approached while asleep, it may awaken\nand angrily give chase in a groggy state of\nsemi-sleep.
It has a brave and trustworthy nature. It\nfearlessly stands up to bigger and\nstronger foes.
This legendary Chinese POKéMON is\nconsidered magnificent. Many people are\nenchanted by its grand mane.
Because it is inept at walking on its newly\ngrown legs, it always swims around in\nwater.

<COL1,PUSH,110,150,255,255>*<COL1,POP>
<COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>SEISMIC TOSS<COL1,POP>!!
Not thrown!
<LINE,33>Depending on the moves your POKéMON can\nuse, there are a number of tactics you can\ndevise. Yes, I'm talking about your battle\nstrategy. Now listen closely--I'm about to\ndiscuss the relationship between moves and\ntactics.
<LINE,33>Take, for example, the moves <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>FLY<COL1,POP> and <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>DIG<COL1,POP>.
It flew up high!
It dug a hole!
<LINE,33>Both moves protect the user most of the time\nfrom taking damage on the first turn. <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>FLY<COL1,POP>\nmakes the user fly high into the sky, while\n<COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>DIG<COL1,POP> lets the user hide underground. On the\nnext turn, the user POKéMON can strike.
<LINE,33>Let me demonstrate how useful a two-turn\nattack can be. Remember that the user won't\ntake a hit on the first turn.
<LINE,33>Suppose your opponent uses a move such as\n<COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>SOLARBEAM<COL1,POP> or <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>SKULL BASH<COL1,POP> that requires the\nuser to charge up for one turn before\nstriking. If you immediately use <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>DIG<COL1,POP> or <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>FLY<COL1,POP>,\nyour opponent's attack won't strike--it'll\nstrike out!
<LINE,33>Since the user won't be hit for an entire\nturn, you can also use these moves just to\nwaste time.
<LINE,33>For example, you could poison your opponent,\ninflicting damage on every turn, then use <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>FLY<COL1,POP>\nor <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>DIG<COL1,POP>. Even though your POKéMON won't be\nable to attack, it will avoid getting hit and\ndamage will still be done to the opponent.
<LINE,33>Similarly, if the opponent uses a protective\nmove such as <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>SAFEGUARD<COL1,POP> or <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>REFLECT<COL1,POP>, keep\nusing two-turn moves to waste time over\nthe five turns that the protective move\nlasts.
<LINE,33>Are you starting to get the hang of it?\nThere is always a way to beat a POKéMON and\nits moves. Try coming up with your own good\nplan before you go for a battle.
<LINE,33>If you win a STADIUM battle without any of\nyour POKéMON fainting, you'll earn a continue.
<LINE,33>Of course that would be wonderful, but don't\njust switch POKéMON without first giving it\nsome thought. Why, you ask? Let me explain.
<LINE,33>When a POKéMON is in trouble, the trainer's\nfirst instinct is to switch it. Keeping your\nPOKéMON safe certainly is important, but\ndon't forget that it takes one full turn to\nswitch.
<LINE,33>That means that the POKéMON you bring\nout will be immediately vulnerable to attack.\nOuch!
<LINE,33>And if that attack inflicts major damage, the\nnew POKéMON could be history in just one\nmore turn! So instead of helping you,\nswitching could put you even deeper in the\nhole.
<LINE,33>Although it may be painful, you might be\nbetter off to keep the hurt POKéMON in the\nbattle until it faints. Although that POKéMON\nwill become useless to you, the next POKéMON\nwill enter the battle with all of its HP intact.
<LINE,33>I believe that while it's hard to leave a hurt\nPOKéMON in battle, it's also a sign of love.\n#71There are times when one must learn to\nendure<COL1,POP><COL2,POP>.
<COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>VULPIX<COL1,POP>
<COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>NINETALES<COL1,POP>
<LINE,33>Today's topic is "Battling for Beginners."\nI'll teach you everything you need to know,\nfrom picking your POKéMON to choosing their\nattacks.
This is not a\nwaste of time!
2 x 1/2 = 1!
(
)
<LINE,33>Greetings! I'm #71EARL<COL1,POP><COL2,POP>. Whether you want to\nbecome a mighty trainer or just learn how to\nwin more battles, I'm the man to see! Let's\nget started. Today's theme is\n"Brushing up on Basic Rules."
<LINE,33>At the STADIUM there are several CUP\ntournaments and a variety of battles.\nAlthough each has different restrictions on\nwhich POKéMON may enter, #71the battle rules\nare virtually identical<COL1,POP><COL2,POP>. Let me begin with\nthese basic rules.
<LINE,33>First, choose six POKéMON from your list of\nqualifiers. These six POKéMON will form your\nteam.
<LINE,33>Choose the three POKéMON that you want to\nbattle from the six on your team. Once you\nhave chosen your combatants, the battle will\nget underway!
<LINE,33>To win the tournament, you must defeat all of\nyour opponents.
<LINE,33>OK! Give it your best shot!
<LINE,33>There are several battle rules that every\ntrainer must obey. It would be best if you\nlearn the rules that must be followed #71in all\nbattles<COL1,POP><COL2,POP>.
<LINE,33>Two or more POKéMON cannot be frozen\nor asleep at the same time. However, it is\nOK for one POKéMON to be asleep and\nanother one to be frozen.
<LINE,33>You cannot use <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>SELFDESTRUCT<COL1,POP> or\n<COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>EXPLOSION<COL1,POP> when you and your opponent\nare down to your last POKéMON. If you\ndo, you'll automatically lose, even if your\nopponent's POKéMON faints. Also,\n<COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>DESTINY BOND<COL1,POP> and <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>PERISH SONG<COL1,POP> will fail.
<LINE,33>Your POKéMON's evolution is a time for\ncelebration! It becomes stronger and more\nattractive, so what could there possibly be\nto complain about? Well for one thing,\nPOKéMON that evolve by leveling up learn\nmoves much more slowly than they did before\nthey evolved.
<LINE,33>For example, <COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>CUBONE<COL1,POP> can learn <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>BONE RUSH<COL1,POP>\nat Level 41. But its evolved form, <COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>MAROWAK<COL1,POP>,\ncan't learn that move until it reaches\nLevel 53.
<LINE,33>Even though some CUP tournaments have level\nrestrictions, you should consider #71canceling\nevolution<COL1,POP><COL2,POP> until your POKéMON have learned\nsome desirable moves.
#71Canceling evolution<COL1,POP><COL2,POP>...
To stop an evolution that is in\nprogress, simply press the\nB Button.
<LINE,33>Before you let your POKéMON evolve, check\nwhen it will learn new moves. No need to evolve\nyour POKéMON hastily. This kind of preliminary\nwork is where your battle actually begins.
<LINE,33>POKéMON that evolve using a STONE such as\n<COL1,PUSH,180,255,134,255>FIRE STONE<COL1,POP> or <COL1,PUSH,180,255,134,255>WATER STONE<COL1,POP> often learn\nextremely few moves after evolution. Even\nthough some CUPS have level restrictions,\nrushing evolution may not be a good idea.
<LINE,33>Here's an example. <COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>VULPIX<COL1,POP> can use a\n<COL1,PUSH,180,255,134,255>FIRE STONE<COL1,POP> to evolve into <COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>NINETALES<COL1,POP>. But \n<COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>NINETALES<COL1,POP> can learn only one move,\n<COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>FIRE SPIN<COL1,POP>.
<LINE,33>Make your POKéMON learn the moves you want\nthem to know before you make them evolve.
<LINE,33>On the other hand, there are some moves that\ncan be learned only after evolution. This\nmakes for quite a dilemma.
<LINE,33>Moves learned before evolution or those\nlearned after evolution? Which should be\nlearned and at what levels? Be sure to weigh\nall the options carefully before you evolve\nyour POKéMON.
<LINE,33>The same goes for POKéMON that evolve\nthrough trading or tameness.\nI recommend that you time your\nevolutions based on the #71levels at which your\nPOKéMON learn moves<COL1,POP><COL2,POP>.
<LINE,33>Now, everyone. Did you know that a POKéMON\ncan battle while HOLDing an item?
<LINE,33>There are many kinds of HOLD items, such as\nthose that restore HP and those that\nenhance abilities.
<LINE,33>Take, for example, HOLD items that raise the\npower of specific types of moves.\n<COL1,PUSH,180,255,134,255>MYSTIC WATER<COL1,POP> and <COL1,PUSH,180,255,134,255>BLACK BELT<COL1,POP> are two such\nitems. HOLDing these items boosts the power\nof a POKéMON's moves by about ten percent.
<LINE,33><COL1,PUSH,180,255,134,255>HARD STONE<COL1,POP> raises\nthe power of ROCK-type\nmoves. Suppose we give it to\nthe WATER-type POKéMON,\n<COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>MARILL<COL1,POP>.
<LINE,33>Be careful! According to #71STADIUM rules<COL1,POP><COL2,POP>,\n#71each POKéMON in your party must HOLD a\ndifferent kind of item <COL1,POP><COL2,POP>. Think about your\nstrategy before you hand out items to your\nPOKéMON.
<LINE,33>Did you know that two new types\nappeared in the Gold and Silver\nversions? The DARK- and STEEL- types!
<LINE,33>The DARK-type is tough against the\nPSYCHIC-type but weak against the\nFIGHTING-type. STEEL-types are unaf-\nfected by poison but weak against fire.
<LINE,33>There are also some POKéMON that have\nchanged types.
<LINE,33><COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>MAGNEMITE<COL1,POP> and <COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>MAGNETON<COL1,POP> are two such\nPOKéMON.
<LINE,33>Type match-ups have changed slightly\nas well.
<LINE,33>GHOST-type moves are now effective\nagainst PSYCHIC-type POKéMON. BUG-\ntype moves are not as effective against\nPOISON-type POKéMON as they were\nbefore. These are some changes.
<LINE,33>Pardon? Oh, you want to know more, do you?\nThen off you go to the LIBRARY! There you\nwill find a whole variety of reference\nmaterials, so it's an excellent place to study\nand review data.
<COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>CLEFAIRY<COL1,POP>
<LINE,33>Instead of being just the ELECTRIC-\ntype, now they are ELECTRIC- & STEEL-\ntype POKéMON. What do you think? Does\nthe enhanced DEFENSE this gives them\nmake this a welcome change? Or do the\nadditional match-up weaknesses outweigh\nthe positive aspects?
<LINE,33>*
<LINE,33>The effects and/or damage ratings for some\nmoves have also changed. Yes, things are\ncertainly a bit different since the days of\nthe POKéMON Red, Blue, and Yellow. Be sure to\nlearn all you can about these changes! 
<LINE,33>First let's review some moves that have\nchanged type. <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>BITE<COL1,POP> became a DARK-type\nmove, while <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>KARATE CHOP<COL1,POP> became a\nFIGHTING move. Likewise, <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>GUST<COL1,POP> is now a\nFLYING-type move.
<LINE,33>The damage ratings for some moves,\nsuch as <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>DOUBLE-EDGE<COL1,POP>, <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>WING ATTACK<COL1,POP>, and\n<COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>DIG<COL1,POP>, have changed.
<LINE,33>The accuracy has also changed for some\nmoves, such as <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>BLIZZARD<COL1,POP>, <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>WHIRLWIND<COL1,POP>,\nand <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>ROCK THROW<COL1,POP>.
<LINE,33>Moves such as <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>WRAP<COL1,POP>, <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>BIND<COL1,POP>, and <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>CLAMP<COL1,POP>\nhave changed greatly. These can now\nprevent an opponent from switching out!
<LINE,33>The moves <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>LIGHT SCREEN<COL1,POP> and <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>REFLECT<COL1,POP> are\nnow effective for five turns each. They\ncreate barriers on the spot, so they\nremain in place even if the target\nPOKéMON switches out.
<LINE,33>There are added effects and altered\nprobabilities for other moves, too. Your\nhomework assignment is to look these up\nyourself!
<LINE,33>It is important to try and see what the\nmoves do.
<LINE,33>In the past, if a target POKéMON's type was\nidentical to an attack move's type, the\nattack move's added effect would never work.
<LINE,33>Now, even if the defending POKéMON's type\nis identical to the attack move's type, the\nadded effect may or may not work.
<LINE,33>That means that the\nELECTRIC-type <COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>ELECTABUZZ<COL1,POP>\ncould become paralyzed by\n<COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>SPARK<COL1,POP>, an ELECTRIC-type\nattack.
There are still some exceptions...
<LINE,33>Attacking a POISON-type POKéMON with a\nPOISON-type move will not poison it! In the\nsame manner, an ICE-type POKéMON cannot\neasily be frozen by an ICE-type move!
<LINE,33>Other than those exceptions, the added\neffects of moves will affect all POKéMON,\neven if attack and defender's type match.
<LINE,33>The Gold and Silver versions have changed\nthings a bit.
<LINE,33>Did you know that the POKéMON stat SPECIAL\nsplit into #71SPCL.ATK<COL1,POP><COL2,POP> and #71SPCL.DEF<COL1,POP><COL2,POP>? Oh, you\nknew that already? Ah, but perhaps you don't\nknow everything about it.
<LINE,33>Before, SPECIAL combined both attack and\ndefense. Now, #71SPCL.ATK<COL1,POP><COL2,POP> stands for\nSPECIAL ATTACK, and #71SPCL.DEF<COL1,POP><COL2,POP> stands for\nSPECIAL DEFENSE. You see? 
This split affects certain moves.
<LINE,33>For example, the move <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>AMNESIA<COL1,POP> used to\nsharply raise SPECIAL. Now it strongly\nboosts #71SPCL.DEF<COL1,POP><COL2,POP> alone. It has no effect on\nSPCL.ATK.
<LINE,33>In contrast, the move <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>GROWTH<COL1,POP> has been \naltered to raise only #71SPCL.ATK<COL1,POP><COL2,POP>. It doesn't\naffect SPCL.DEF at all.
<LINE,33>Strategy is becoming more and more\nimportant, but don't worry. As long as you pay\nclose attention to my lessons, you should\nhave no problems.
<LINE,33>At the very least, you should have <COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>VULPIX<COL1,POP>\nlearn <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>FLAMETHROWER<COL1,POP> before letting it evolve.
<LINE,33>I'm sure you know about status problems.\nThey are conditions such as poison, sleep, and\nburn that put you at a disadvantage in\nbattle. But did you also know that there are\nother conditions that are similar to status\nproblems? Allow me to explain.
<LINE,33>ATTRACT could cause infatuation, pre-\nventing a male POKéMON from attacking a\nfemale half the time and vice-versa.
<LINE,33>The move NIGHTMARE works only on\nsleeping opponents. Each turn, it steals\naway a quarter of the victim's HP.
<LINE,33>The move CURSE, when used by a\nGHOST-type POKéMON, causes the victim\nto lose a quarter of its HP every turn.\nThese are only a few examples.
<LINE,33>When certain moves such as <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>HEADBUTT<COL1,POP> or\n<COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>BITE<COL1,POP> strike first, the defending POKéMON\nmay flinch and be unable to respond in the\nsame turn. Yes, this too is a type of added\neffect.
<LINE,33>Now this part is very important, so listen\nclosely. #71Some status problems even affect a\nPOKéMON's stats<COL1,POP><COL2,POP>!
<LINE,33>For example, not only does a burn cause\ndamage every turn, it also weakens ATTACK\npower.
<LINE,33>Paralysis may immobilize a POKéMON,\nbut it also sharply reduces SPEED.
<LINE,33>Knowing that, you could deliberately use a\nstatus problem to make up for your own\nPOKéMON's weaknesses. But regardless of\nwhether your POKéMON is weak or strong...\nWhatever POKéMON you use, your love and\nstrategy will help you win. 
<LINE,33>Before I conclude, let me tell you about\nstatus problems that wear off during battle.
<LINE,33>There are exactly four: asleep, confused,\nhaving a NIGHTMARE, and frozen. That's\nright! Now a frozen POKéMON will thaw out\nover time.
That would shock\neven <COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>ELECTABUZZ<COL1,POP>!
<LINE,33>POKéMON are not affected as often by status\nproblems that match their own types.
<LINE,33>POKéMON and moves come in a variety of\ntypes, such as NORMAL, FIRE, WATER, GRASS,\nELECTRIC, and GHOST. There are seventeen\ntypes in all. The key point is that not only are\nPOKéMON classified by type, but there are\ntypes for moves, too.
<LINE,33>The combination of the type of POKéMON\nunder attack and the type of the attack\nmove is referred to as the type match-up.
<LINE,33>If the type match-up is good, it may be\npossible to inflict double the damage. On the\nother hand, if the type match-up is bad, an\nattack may not have any effect at all.
<LINE,33>Here's an example. WATER-type POKéMON\nare strong against FIRE-type attacks but\nweak against GRASS-type attacks.
<LINE,33>WATER-type POKéMON:\n<COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>TOTODILE<COL1,POP>
<LINE,33>As you can see, a POKéMON's type is\nvery important when it is under attack.
<LINE,33>We have here a FIRE-type move. It is\nsuper-effective against GRASS-type\nPOKéMON but weak against WATER-type\nPOKéMON.
<LINE,33>FIRE-type move: \n<COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>FLAMETHROWER<COL1,POP>
<LINE,33>As you can see, a move's type becomes\nimportant when it is used for attack.
<LINE,33>The key point here is that there is no link\nbetween the item and the type of POKéMON\nusing it.
<LINE,33>Exploiting the opponent's weakness... This is\na basic strategy for POKéMON battles. If you\nuse an attack that matches up favorably\nagainst the defender's type, you can inflict\ndouble the damage.
<LINE,33>For example, let's attack a FLYING-type\nPOKéMON with an ELECTRIC-type move.
<LINE,33>Ah! See? It picked on a weak spot to cause\ndouble the damage. Even FALKNER, the bird\nuser, would be aghast! Similarly, attacking a\nWATER-type POKéMON with a GRASS-type\nmove, or attacking a GRASS-type POKéMON\nwith a FIRE-type move, will be\n"super-effective."
<LINE,33>In contrast, if an attack is "not very \neffective,"  the type match-up is bad.\nThat means the move's impact will be half its\nusual level.
<LINE,33>If a move has "no effect," then the type\nmatch-up is simply the worst. The move's\npower will drop to zero, so it will be unable to\ninflict any damage at all.
<LINE,33>For example, <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>SELFDESTRUCT<COL1,POP> is a NORMAL-type\nmove. It has no effect on GHOST-type\nPOKéMON because that type match-up is the\nworst.
<LINE,33>To avoid such an embarrassing situation, read\nand review the material on type match-ups in\nthe LIBRARY.
<COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>THUNDER<COL1,POP>!!
It's super-effective!
<LINE,33>As you know, POKéMON and moves come in a\nvariety of types. When a POKéMON is\nattacking, if its type is the same as its move\ntype, the move's impact will increase to\n1.5 times its usual level.
<LINE,33>For example, if the\nELECTRIC-type <COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>PIKACHU<COL1,POP> uses\nan ELECTRIC-type move, the\nattack will have 1.5 times its\nusual power.
<COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>THUNDERBOLT<COL1,POP>!!
<LINE,33>In the same manner, if a NORMAL-type move is\nused by a NORMAL-type POKéMON, the attack\nwill also be 1.5 times more powerful than it\nwould be if a POKéMON of a different type\nused it. Don't forget this important point!
<LINE,33>Of course, since this combination only\nmultiplies the power of attack moves by 1.5,\nsupport moves that aren't used for attack\nare not affected.
<LINE,33>Lets say <COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>GENGAR<COL1,POP> uses a GHOST-type move\nsuch as <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>SPITE<COL1,POP> or <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>CONFUSE RAY<COL1,POP>. In such a\ncase, the move's accuracy or effect will not\nbe boosted by the identical type combination.
<LINE,33>There are also moves that inflict fixed\namounts of damage. These will not be\nmultiplied by a factor of 1.5 either. I will\ncover this topic in greater detail a bit later,\nso please keep this point in mind.
<LINE,33>Support moves--do you use them effectively\nin battle? When used correctly, they can\ngreatly improve your chance of winning. There\nare a great deal of support moves. If you\nlearn to use them properly, you could become\na modern-day ninja!
<COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>DREAM EATER<COL1,POP>!!
<LINE,33>Try a move that causes status problems.\nIf the foe becomes paralyzed, burned, or\nfalls asleep, the battle will be much easier.
<LINE,33>For example, <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>THUNDER WAVE<COL1,POP> and <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>CONFUSE RAY<COL1,POP>\nare very powerful.
<LINE,33>As a countermeasure, you could use\n<COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>SAFEGUARD<COL1,POP> to prevent status problems for\nfive turns.
<LINE,33>Or you could use <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>HEAL BELL<COL1,POP>\nto cure all your POKéMON\nof status problems.
<LINE,33>There are some stats, such as ATTACK,\nDEFENSE, and accuracy, that can be\ntemporarily affected by moves during battle.
<LINE,33>Use moves like <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>BELLY DRUM<COL1,POP> and <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>SWORDS DANCE<COL1,POP>\non your own POKéMON before attacking. These\nmoves strongly boost ATTACK power.
<LINE,33>To counteract such moves, use <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>HAZE<COL1,POP>. It will\nreturn any POKéMON stat change back to\nnormal. However, be aware that this move will\nwork on both your POKéMON and the opponent,\nand it will reset stats regardless of whether\nthe ability is up or down.
<LINE,33>Ah, yes. Any altered stat will return to\nnormal if the POKéMON is switched out. It may\nbe effective to obstruct switching by using a\nmove such as <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>SPIDER WEB<COL1,POP> or <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>MEAN LOOK<COL1,POP>.
<LINE,33>Two other moves that you may find useful are\n<COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>REFLECT<COL1,POP> and <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>LIGHT SCREEN<COL1,POP>. <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>REFLECT<COL1,POP> halves\nthe damage from physical attacks over five\nturns, and <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>LIGHT SCREEN<COL1,POP> halves the damage\nfrom special attacks.
<LINE,33><COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>FORESIGHT<COL1,POP> is another good move. It returns\nthe opponent's evasiveness to normal. Sigh...\nThere are far too many moves for me to\ndescribe them all. Your homework assignment\nis to study the rest on your own.
<LINE,33>When you attack, how do you choose which\nmoves to use? Do you base your decision\nsolely on the move's POWER? I recommend that\nyou consider moves that have #71added\neffects<COL1,POP><COL2,POP>.\nTruth be told, they can be very convenient.
<LINE,33>For example, there are moves that give the\ntarget status problems. These moves don't\njust inflict damage, they also cause status\nproblems like paralysis, poison, freezing,\nburn, and confusion.
<LINE,30><COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>DIZZY PUNCH<COL1,POP> is a good example. It has a\none-in-five chance of confusing the\ntarget--a very nice bonus!
<COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>DIZZY PUNCH<COL1,POP>!!
#71Dmg/Cnf<COL1,POP><COL2,POP>
G' night
<LINE,33>There are also moves that inflict\ndamage and lower stats like DEFENSE and\nevasiveness.
<LINE,33>For example, <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>PSYCHIC<COL1,POP> has a one-in-ten\nchance of reducing the target's SPCL.DEF.
<LINE,33>Some moves raise the attacker's stats after\ninflicting damage on the target.
<LINE,33><COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>STEEL WING<COL1,POP> is one example. It has a\none-in-ten chance of raising the user's\nDEFENSE.
<LINE,33>Are you getting all this? Moves with added\neffects can be very convenient. I suggest\nyou try them yourself.
<LINE,33>POKéMON moves are not only for attack.\nThere are also those that heal POKéMON. Let\nme describe some to you.
<LINE,33>First, moves that restore HP include\n<COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>RECOVER<COL1,POP>, <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>MILK DRINK<COL1,POP>, and <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>SOFTBOILED<COL1,POP>. Each\nof these restores HP by exactly one-half the\nmaximum HP.
<LINE,33><COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>MORNING SUN<COL1,POP>, <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>SYNTHESIS<COL1,POP>, and <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>MOONLIGHT<COL1,POP>\nare HP-restoring moves that vary in effect-\niveness depending on the time they are used.
<LINE,33>In battle, however, these moves restore\nHP by one-half the maximum HP no matter what\ntime of day it is.
<LINE,33>Oh, yes. There are also <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>LEECH LIFE<COL1,POP>,\n<COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>MEGA DRAIN<COL1,POP>, <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>GIGA DRAIN<COL1,POP>, <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>DREAM EATER<COL1,POP>\nand <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>ABSORB<COL1,POP>.
<LINE,33>But it's not only about restoring HP. There\nare moves that get rid of status problems,\ntoo. <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>HEAL BELL<COL1,POP>, for example, eliminates all\nstatus problems for all the POKéMON on your\nparty.
<LINE,33>The move <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>REST<COL1,POP> fully restores HP and gets rid\nof any status problems. Your POKéMON sleeps\nfor two turns to rid itself of problems like\nburn and paralysis.
<LINE,33>Simultaneously, any stats that\nwere affected by problems--\nsuch as a lowered ATTACK due\nto a burn or reduced SPEED due\nto paralysis--will be fixed.
<LINE,33>However, even <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>REST<COL1,POP> can't change stats that\nwere altered by other support moves or by\nother means. So ATTACK raised by using\n<COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>MEDITATE<COL1,POP> would remain unchanged, as would\naccuracy reduced by an opponent's <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>FLASH<COL1,POP>. 
<LINE,33>Incidentally, to restore altered stats, you\ncan either switch POKéMON or use <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>HAZE<COL1,POP>. I \nalready described this move in my lesson on\n#71support moves<COL1,POP><COL2,POP>. Remember?
<LINE,33>Do you know about set damage attacks?\n#71These moves inflict fixed amounts of\ndamage regardless of the user's ATTACK\npower and the target's DEFENSE<COL1,POP><COL2,POP>.\nLet me give you some examples.
<LINE,33>The NORMAL-type move <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>SONICBOOM<COL1,POP>\nalways inflicts 20HP damage.
<LINE,33>Similarly, the DRAGON-type move\n<COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>DRAGON RAGE<COL1,POP> consistently inflicts 40HP\ndamage.
<LINE,33>The GHOST-type move <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>NIGHT SHADE<COL1,POP>\nand the FIGHTING-type move\n<COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>SEISMIC TOSS<COL1,POP> also work similarly. These\nmoves hit the target with the same\namount of HP damage as the user's level.
<LINE,33>How were my lectures for the\nTRAINER CLASS? Were they interesting? If\nyou're confident, try out our tests. This will\nbe it for now!
<LINE,33>There is something I need to tell you.
<LINE,33>Even if your POKéMON's type and its\nattack-move type are identical, the\nmove's power will not be multiplied x 1.5.
<LINE,33>The move's power will also not change,\neven if the type match-up is good or bad.\nIn other words, the move will be neither\n"super-effective" nor\n"not very effective."
The move also will not hit a weak spot.
<LINE,33>Of course, since they are #71set damage<COL1,POP><COL2,POP> moves,\nit's only natural that their power is not\ndoubled, multiplied by 1.5 or halved.
<LINE,33>That said, #71whether the move works or not\ndoes depend on type match-ups<COL1,POP><COL2,POP>.
<LINE,33>For example, <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>SEISMIC TOSS<COL1,POP> is a\nFIGHTING-type move, so it won't work on\nGHOST-type POKéMON. In that regard, it's\nno different from other moves. Similarly,\n<COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>STRENGTH<COL1,POP> and <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>MEGA PUNCH<COL1,POP> are also\nineffective against GHOST-type POKéMON.\nBe aware of this important point.
<LINE,33>Be sure to check\nthe opposing POKéMON's type.
<LINE,33>Did you know that there are two kinds of\nattacks? #71Physical attacks<COL1,POP><COL2,POP> and #71special\nattacks<COL1,POP><COL2,POP>. The type of move determines\nwhether an attack is physical or special. This\nis a very important point to remember.
<LINE,33>The amount of damage inflicted is determined\nbased on the difference between physical and\nspecial attacks.
<LINE,33>The amount of damage inflicted by a\n#71physical attack<COL1,POP><COL2,POP> depends on the\nattacker's #71ATTACK<COL1,POP><COL2,POP> and the target's\n#71DEFENSE<COL1,POP><COL2,POP> stats.
<LINE,33>The amount of damage caused by a\n#71special attack<COL1,POP><COL2,POP> depends on the\nattacker's #71SPCL.ATK<COL1,POP><COL2,POP> and the target's\n#71SPCL.DEF<COL1,POP><COL2,POP>.
<LINE,33>Quite simple, isn't it? Now you see the\nrelationship between POKéMON stats and the\npower of moves. Now let me explain what types\nof moves would be physical and what would be\nspecial.
<LINE,33>Every NORMAL-, FIGHTING-, BUG-,\nFLYING-, GROUND-, ROCK-, GHOST-,\nPOISON-, and STEEL-type move is a\nphysical attack.
<LINE,33>Every FIRE-, WATER-, ELECTRIC-,\nGRASS-, ICE-, PSYCHIC-, DRAGON-, and\nDARK-type move is a special attack.
<LINE,33>Consider BUG-type moves. Since\nthey are physical attacks, they\nwill be more powerful when used\nby a POKéMON with a high ATTACK\nstat.
<COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>MEGAHORN<COL1,POP>!!
<LINE,33>Did you understand the distinction between\nphysical and special attacks? Whether you\nunderstand or not will make a huge difference\nin battle.
<LINE,33>You do know that a POKéMON can go into\nbattle while HOLDing an item? Next, we'll delve\na little further into this topic with a lesson\nI call "Introducing Items." I will teach you\nhow to battle by combining moves and items.
<LINE,33>#71Combining moves and items<COL1,POP><COL2,POP>...\nWhat could this mean?
<LINE,33>If a POKéMON is HOLDing a <COL1,PUSH,180,255,134,255>PSNCUREBERRY<COL1,POP> or\n<COL1,PUSH,180,255,134,255>PRZCUREBERRY<COL1,POP>, it will automatically use that\nitem during battle to heal itself of poison or\nparalysis. I suggest that you deliberately\ncombine such items with certain moves.
<LINE,33>Take, for example, the DRAGON-type move\n<COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>OUTRAGE<COL1,POP>. Although it is powerful, the user\nbecomes confused after two to three turns.
<LINE,33>But try making the POKéMON using <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>OUTRAGE<COL1,POP>\nHOLD a <COL1,PUSH,180,255,134,255>BITTER BERRY<COL1,POP>. As soon as the\nPOKéMON becomes confused, it will auto-\nmatically use the held item to get rid of its\nconfusion. Isn't that convenient?
There are other combinations, too.
<LINE,33>Consider the Psychic-type move <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>REST<COL1,POP>.\nIf you were to equip a POKéMON that knows\nthis move with a <COL1,PUSH,180,255,134,255>MINT BERRY<COL1,POP> in advance...
<LINE,33>When it falls asleep, its HP will be restored\nand any status problems eliminated. Then it\nwill use the <COL1,PUSH,180,255,134,255>MINT BERRY<COL1,POP> to wake up. So\ninstead of having to wait two turns, it will be\nready to battle right away!
<LINE,33>This move is sure to annoy your foe. The only\nsaving grace from your foe's point of view is\nthat <COL1,PUSH,180,255,134,255>MINT BERRY<COL1,POP> can be used only once.
If tired, use <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>REST<COL1,POP>!
#71Rise and shine!<COL1,POP><COL2,POP>
<LINE,33>Under #71STADIUM rules<COL1,POP><COL2,POP>, #71your party\nPOKéMON are not allowed to HOLD the same\nkinds of items. The HOLD items must all be\ndifferent<COL1,POP><COL2,POP>. Therefore, you should carefully\nconsider the combinations of items and\nPOKéMON.
<LINE,33>Normally, status problems do not double up.\nHowever, I imagine you have experienced\nsituations in which a POKéMON suffers from\nmore than one kind of status problem.\nI personally have had a POKéMON that was\nboth paralyzed and confused at the same\ntime.
<LINE,33>Status problems can be largely divided into\ntwo categories. The categorization depends\non whether the status problem is #71indicated\nor not<COL1,POP><COL2,POP>.
<LINE,33>#71Those that are indicated on the screen<COL1,POP><COL2,POP>\nare poison, paralysis, burn, sleep, and\nfreeze. These are the #71real status\nproblems<COL1,POP><COL2,POP>.
<LINE,33>#71Those that aren't indicated on the\nscreen are similar in nature to real\nstatus problems<COL1,POP><COL2,POP>. These include\nCONFUSION, CURSE, NIGHTMARE,\nATTRACT, flinch, and LEECH SEED.
<LINE,33>This is an important part. Those conditions\nthat are indicated on the screen\n--the real status problems-- do not double\nup. If a POKéMON already has a status\nproblem, it can't be hit with another one.
<LINE,33>For example, a sleeping POKéMON's status\nwould be indicated as "Sp". In that\nsituation, it is not vulnerable to any other\nstatus problem such as poison, paralysis,\nburn, or freeze.
<LINE,33>However, a POKéMON with a status problem is\nstill susceptible to any other kind of\nabnormality. For instance, a frozen POKéMON\ncan still be confused or made infatuated.
<LINE,33>Incidentally, #71it is possible for a POKéMON\nto be afflicted with multiple kinds of abnor-\nmalities that aren't real status problems<COL1,POP><COL2,POP>.
<LINE,33>So a POKéMON can be simultaneously afflicted\nwith such conditions as CURSE, NIGHTMARE,\nCONFUSION, and ATTRACT.
<LINE,33>However, these abnormalities are entirely\nlifted if the affected POKéMON switches out.\nPlease don't forget that.
<LINE,33>(Of course, if it were me, I would use\n<COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>MEAN LOOK<COL1,POP> to make it impossible for the\naffected POKéMON to switch! Ho, ho, ho...)
<LINE,33>Here's another important point. Any move\nthat could cause a burn will thaw out a frozen\nPOKéMON. The heat causes the ice to melt,\nnaturally.
<LINE,33>You already know that some POKéMON have two\ntypes. For example, consider a GRASS- &\nPOISON-type POKéMON. The power of its\nGRASS- and POISON-type moves will be\nmultiplied by 1.5. Ah, you knew that already?\nGood. Then I'll explain further.
<LINE,33>A dual-type POKéMON also has two sets of\ntype match-ups. This is especially important\nwhen it is attacked.
<LINE,33>Do you know type match-ups? Double damage\nis inflicted if a move is "super-effective."\nIf it's "not very effective," the power is\nhalved. If it has "no effect," its power is\nzero.
<LINE,33>When a dual-type POKéMON is attacked, the\ntwo type match-ups are multiplied. This is how\nit works: Type 1 x Type 2. Perhaps I should\nexplain a bit further.
<LINE,33>Say a dual-type POKéMON is hit by an attack.\nAlso assume that the type match-up of the\nattack move is good against both types. In\nthis case, Type 1 takes double damage, and\nType 2 takes double damage. Now, multiply the\ntwo damage multipliers: 2 x 2 = 4. In other\nwords, the move's power is quadrupled!
<LINE,33>For example, let's say a FIRE- & ROCK-type\n<COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>MAGCARGO<COL1,POP> is hit by a WATER-type attack. As a\nWATER attack is "super-effective" against\nboth POKéMON types, the damage would be\nfour times greater\nthan normal.
Quadruple!
<LINE,33>The opposite could also occur. Consider this: \nType 1 halves the damage, and Type 2\nhalves the damage. Multiplying these, we get\n1/2 x 1/2 = 1/4. So in this case, the POKéMON\nwould be hit with only 1/4 the usual power.
<LINE,33>An example would be a BUG- & POISON-type\n<COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>SPINARAK<COL1,POP> hit by a GRASS-type attack that's\n"not very effective" against either type.
A mere scrape!
<LINE,33>How about this situation? Type 1 takes\ndouble the damage; Type 2 halves the damage.\nMultiplying the damage multipliers, 2 x 1/2,\nwe get the combined damage multiplier of one. \nIn this case, the poor Type 1 match-up is\nrectified by the favorable Type 2 match-up.
<LINE,33>The WATER- & ELECTRIC-type <COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>LANTURN<COL1,POP>\nand similar POKéMON manage to protect\nthemselves against ELECTRIC-type attacks.
<LINE,33>This one should be obvious. Type 1 takes\ndouble the damage; Type 2 takes no damage at\nall. In this situation, the multiplication of\ndamage multipliers is 2 x 0 = 0. In other words,\nthe move will have "no effect."
<LINE,33>Let's say a POISON- & FLYING-type <COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>GOLBAT<COL1,POP>\nis attacked by <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>EARTHQUAKE<COL1,POP>, a GROUND-type\nmove. According to type match-ups, POISON-\ntype POKéMON take double damage from\nGROUND-type attacks. But because GROUND-\ntype attacks have no effect on FLYING-type\nPOKéMON, the multiplier is 2 x 0 = 0. The\nGROUND-type attack can't inflict any damage.
<LINE,33>As I have just shown, dual-type POKéMON\nmay have more weaknesses and/or cleverly\ncover for weaknesses. This is just one of the\nwonderful mysteries that surround POKéMON. 
<LINE,33>OK! This lesson is on everyone's favorite\ntopic: "Match-up Math"! I will show you how\nmuch damage can vary due to POKéMON types\nand type match-ups.
<LINE,33>Previously, I told you about POKéMON that\nhave two types. Did you understand that\ntopic?
<LINE,33>A dual-type POKéMON multiplies the damage\nmultipliers of two type match-ups. At most,\nthe damage could be quadrupled. At worst, it\nmay not inflict any damage. Obviously, the\namount of damage inflicted could vary a lot.
<LINE,33>Actually, there are other multipliers!
<LINE,33>If the POKéMON's type and the move\ntype are the same, the move's attack\npower is multiplied by 1.5.
Hitting a weak spot means double damage.
These factors are also multiplied.
<LINE,33>Let me give you an example. Let's say an\nELECTRIC-type <COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>AMPHAROS<COL1,POP> is battling a\nWATER- & FLYING-type <COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>GYARADOS<COL1,POP>.
<COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>AMPHAROS<COL1,POP> used <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>THUNDERBOLT<COL1,POP>!

<COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>AMPHAROS<COL1,POP>

<COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>AMPHAROS<COL1,POP>\nused an\nELECTRIC\n-type move,\nwhich matches\nits own type.
The ELECTRIC\n-move strikes a\nWATER- &\nFLYING-type\nPOKéMON. The\ncombined damage\nmultiplier is\n2 x 2 = 4, or\nx 4 the damage.
And let's\nsay the\nmove\nstrikes a\nweak spot.

<LINE,33>If the attack becomes a "critical hit."
<LINE,33>Multiplying these factors out we get:\n1.5 x 4 x 2 = 12 Ka-pow! That's twelve times\nthe normal damage! So if you're lucky, an\nattack could inflict up to #71twelve times<COL1,POP><COL2,POP> the\nmove's normal damage!
<COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>GENGAR<COL1,POP>!
vs
<LINE,33>If a move's base power is 10, its power would\nbe multiplied by 12 to make it 120. Isn't that\nspectacular? That's why it's critical that you\npay attention to type match-ups in battle.
<LINE,33>Do you remember the set damage moves?\nThose are the moves that inflict fixed\namounts of damage regardless of the\nattacker's and the target's types.
<LINE,33>Moves like <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>SONICBOOM<COL1,POP>, <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>DRAGON RAGE<COL1,POP>,\n<COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>NIGHT SHADE<COL1,POP> and <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>SEISMIC TOSS<COL1,POP>...\nDo you remember them now?
<LINE,33>With these moves, there is #71no need to worry\nabout ATTACK or SPCL.ATK stats<COL1,POP><COL2,POP>. Here's why.
<LINE,33>For example, let's say a <COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>GENGAR<COL1,POP>\nuses a GHOST-type move. The\nmove's power is multiplied by 1.5.\nHowever, <COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>GENGAR<COL1,POP>'s ATTACK\nstat is relatively low.
<LINE,33>In that case, it may be more effective to\ninflict a set amount of damage using\n<COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>NIGHT SHADE<COL1,POP>.
<LINE,33>When is a move most effective? Find out, then\nuse your moves accordingly. Then, you'll be\nready for the GYM LEADER CLASS!
<LINE,33>Let me explain some key points on set\ndamage moves.
<LINE,33>The power stays the same even if stats\nare raised or lowered by support moves.
<LINE,33>However, it is possible to change\naccuracy or evasiveness using support\nmoves.
<LINE,33>Even if <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>REFLECT<COL1,POP> or <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>LIGHT SCREEN<COL1,POP> is\nused, the damage inflicted by set\ndamage moves remains unaffected.
<LINE,33>When I was discussing moves and tactics in\nthe TRAINER CLASS, I covered the two moves\nof <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>FLY<COL1,POP> and <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>DIG<COL1,POP>. Do you remember?
<LINE,33>I taught you that both moves avoid damage on\nthe first turn, and I described some tactics\nthat take advantage of that fact.
<LINE,33>Of course, even these moves do not protect\nthe user against status abnormalities such\nas CURSE or POISON.
<LINE,33>But there's more. There are actually moves\nthat can strike a POKéMON while it's using\n<COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>FLY<COL1,POP> or <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>DIG<COL1,POP>.
<LINE,33>Moves that can strike a\nPOKéMON that's using <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>FLY<COL1,POP>...
<LINE,33>They include <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>THUNDER<COL1,POP>, <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>GUST<COL1,POP>, <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>TWISTER<COL1,POP>\nand <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>WHIRLWIND<COL1,POP>.
<LINE,33>In particular, <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>GUST<COL1,POP> and <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>TWISTER<COL1,POP> double\nin power when the target uses <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>FLY<COL1,POP>.
<LINE,33>If a <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>SANDSTORM<COL1,POP> is blowing when a\nPOKéMON uses <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>FLY<COL1,POP>, the POKéMON will be\nhurt.
<LINE,33>There are also moves that\ncan attack a POKéMON\nthat's using <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>DIG<COL1,POP>.
<LINE,33>They include <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>EARTHQUAKE<COL1,POP>, <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>MAGNITUDE<COL1,POP>\nand <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>FISSURE<COL1,POP>.
<LINE,33>The moves <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>EARTHQUAKE<COL1,POP> and <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>MAGNITUDE<COL1,POP>\nare doubled in power when the target\nPOKéMON is using <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>DIG<COL1,POP>.
<LINE,33>Oh yes, even if the opponent is using <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>WRAP<COL1,POP>\nor <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>CLAMP<COL1,POP>, it's still possible to use <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>DIG<COL1,POP> or\n<COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>FLY<COL1,POP>. However, your POKéMON will still be hurt\nby these restraining attacks while flying or\nunderground.
<LINE,33>So, as you have seen, the range of tactics\nopen to you has widened even further. That's\nwhy it is so important to try to predict what\nyour opponent might do in battle.
<LINE,33>A key point for winning at the STADIUM is to\nteach your POKéMON a variety of move types.\nLet me explain.
<LINE,33>If a POKéMON's type matches the move type,\nthe move's power is multiplied by 1.5,\ncorrect? But this could trip you up. If a\nPOKéMON has only this one type of move, it\nwould be at a great disadvantage against a\nPOKéMON with a poor type match-up.
<LINE,33>For example, take the FIRE-type\nPOKéMON <COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>TYPHLOSION<COL1,POP>. It certainly is a tough\nPOKéMON. But what if its opponent is a\nWATER-type POKéMON? If <COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>TYPHLOSION<COL1,POP>\nknows only FIRE-type moves, it can inflict\nonly half the usual damage on the opponent.
<LINE,33>What if it also knew <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>THUNDERPUNCH<COL1,POP>? Ah, yes.\nThis inflicts double the damage. You could\ncatch your opponent off guard.
<LINE,33>If <COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>TYPHLOSION<COL1,POP> also knew the move\n<COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>EARTHQUAKE<COL1,POP>, it could hit FIRE-, POISON-,\nELECTRIC-, ROCK-, and STEEL-type POKéMON\nwith "super-effective" attacks.
<LINE,33>Think of balance when making POKéMON\nlearn moves.
<LINE,33>In CUP competition, you will face a wide\nvariety of POKéMON. It would be very hard to\nwin all the battles without first preparing\nyour team to contend with every type of\nPOKéMON.
<LINE,33>It is extremely important to balance your\nteam with a variety of POKéMON.
<LINE,33>In conclusion... The key to battling is #71to use\ndifferent types of POKéMON and moves<COL1,POP><COL2,POP>. If\nyou heed this advice when assembling your\nteam, I am certain you will conquer the\nSTADIUM tournaments. On to victory!
<COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>THUNDERPUNCH<COL1,POP>!!
#71Super-effective!<COL1,POP><COL2,POP>
<LINE,33>An unnecessary POKéMON switch could be\ndisastrous. Haven't I taught you that?\nBecause switching uses up a turn, the\nopponent may hit the switched-in POKéMON as\nsoon as it appears.
<LINE,33>But there is such a thing as waste-free\nswitching. What do you suppose that could be?
<LINE,33>Here's one example. #71Switch in a POKéMON\nthat is unaffected by the opponent's attack<COL1,POP><COL2,POP>.\nThis switch is one that gives priority to\ndefense.
<LINE,33>Try this scenario. Let's say your opponent\nsends out a GROUND-type <COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>DUGTRIO<COL1,POP>. It's\nhighly likely that this POKéMON will know\npowerful GROUND-type attacks such as\n<COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>EARTHQUAKE<COL1,POP> or <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>MAGNITUDE<COL1,POP>.
<LINE,33>In that case, switch in a FLYING-type\nPOKéMON. Because a GROUND-type move has no\neffect on FLYING-type POKéMON, you can\nswitch in without taking any damage.
<LINE,33>Even if the opponent launches\nan attack at the switched-in\nPOKéMON, if it is unaffected,\nthen the switching wasn't a\nwaste of time.
<LINE,33>Switching in this way gives you a\ndistinct advantage. The opponent's best\nmoves are made totally ineffective against\nyou. Of course, this might prompt your\nopponent to switch out, as well.
<LINE,33>This is why switching in battle requires some\ncareful consideration.
<LINE,33>If you master switching, you can master\nbattles.
<LINE,33>In battle, it is extremely important to be\nable to analyze both your POKéMON's\nsituation and that of your opponent's\nPOKéMON.
<LINE,33>Let me explain what I mean in detail.
<LINE,33>If a PSYCHIC-type <COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>ALAKAZAM<COL1,POP> uses\nthe PSYCHIC-type move <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>PSYCHIC<COL1,POP>,\nthe move's power is multiplied\nby 1.5.
<LINE,33>That is the expected conclusion. However,\nthat assumption could come back to haunt\nyou.
<LINE,33>For example, what if the opponent were a\nNORMAL-type <COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>BLISSEY<COL1,POP>?
<LINE,33>The type match-up against\n<COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>BLISSEY<COL1,POP> is neither good nor\nbad. The problem lies with\nPOKéMON stats.
<LINE,33>Do you know <COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>BLISSEY<COL1,POP>'s stats? While\nits #71SPCL.DEF<COL1,POP><COL2,POP> is high, its #71DEFENSE<COL1,POP><COL2,POP> is\nvery low.
<LINE,33>Though <COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>ALAKAZAM<COL1,POP> is good at PSYCHIC-type\nmoves, they do little damage against <COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>BLISSEY<COL1,POP>.
<LINE,33>This is why you must consider the stats of\nopposing POKéMON along with type match-ups\nin battle.
<COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>ALAKAZAM<COL1,POP>!
<COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>BLISSEY<COL1,POP>!
<LINE,33>Welcome to the ELITE FOUR CLASS!\n(This student must like me...)
<LINE,33>Welcome to the ELITE FOUR CLASS!\n(This student must like me...) Let's get\nstarted right away. Now I will cover a very\ninteresting topic: "Double-Duty Damage"?
<LINE,33>Have you ever noticed a POKéMON HOLDing an\nitem even though you never gave one to it?
<LINE,33>Actually, #71some wild POKéMON are already\nHOLDing items<COL1,POP><COL2,POP>. In very rare cases, they may\neven be HOLDing exceedingly rare items.
<LINE,33>For example, my own experience tells me that\nabout one in every four wild <COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>CLEFAIRY<COL1,POP> HOLDs\na <COL1,PUSH,180,255,134,255>MYSTERYBERRY<COL1,POP>.
<LINE,33>In very rare cases, a\nwild <COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>CLEFAIRY<COL1,POP> may be\nHOLDing a <COL1,PUSH,180,255,134,255>MOON STONE<COL1,POP>.\nWouldn't that\nbe wonderful?
(I certainly would like to use <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>THIEF<COL1,POP> on it!)
<LINE,33>Also, a POKéMON that is traded from Red,\nBlue, or Yellow into the world of Gold and\nSilver will always be HOLDing an item of\nsome sort. What a great deal!
<LINE,33>The item differs from POKéMON to POKéMON.\nFor example, <COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>TANGELA<COL1,POP> is always HOLDing\n<COL1,PUSH,180,255,134,255>BITTERBERRY<COL1,POP>!
<LINE,33>The kind of item held by a POKéMON doesn't\nchange if the POKéMON evolves. Also, the\nPOKéMON won't switch its held item with\nanother item.
<LINE,33>The item a wild POKéMON prefers won't\nchange. Let's say you catch a wild NIDORAN♀\nand evolve it into <COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>NIDORINA<COL1,POP> or <COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>NIDOQUEEN<COL1,POP>.\nThe evolved forms will still be HOLDing the\nsame item as the unevolved NIDORAN♀. Its\nheld item will always be <COL1,PUSH,180,255,134,255>TM43 DETECT<COL1,POP>.
<LINE,33>If you catch a wild <COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>NIDORINA<COL1,POP>, its held item\nwon't change if it evolves into a <COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>NIDOQUEEN<COL1,POP>.\nThe item it HOLDs will still remain the same as\nfor <COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>NIDORINA<COL1,POP> , a <COL1,PUSH,180,255,134,255>BERRY<COL1,POP>.
<LINE,33>There are also items that are held only by\nspecific POKéMON. For instance, there is an\nitem that is held only by wild <COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>KADABRA<COL1,POP> in the\nYellow version. Can you find others?
<LINE,33>Before I finish,#71 I have to tell you about\nitems that are useless unless held by specific\nPOKéMON<COL1,POP><COL2,POP>. I'll give you just a few examples.
<LINE,33>One example is <COL1,PUSH,180,255,134,255>LIGHT BALL<COL1,POP>. This item\ndoubles the power of special attacks but\nonly if it is held by a <COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>PIKACHU<COL1,POP>.
<LINE,33>The HOLD item <COL1,PUSH,180,255,134,255>THICK CLUB<COL1,POP> is only for\n<COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>CUBONE<COL1,POP> and <COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>MAROWAK<COL1,POP>. It doubles the\npower of physical attacks. There are\nothers too.
<LINE,33>(Hmm... I wish I had one...)
<LINE,33>If the move's and the POKéMON's types match,\ndamage is x 1.5. If the move's type match-up\nis good against both of the target's types,\ndamage is x 4. For a critical hit, it is x 2.
<LINE,33>By multiplying all these damage multipliers\ntogether, we get: 1.5 x 4 x 2 = 12 times the\ndamage. I explained this part earlier.
<LINE,33>Actually, there are two other multipliers that\nmay also be applied. Let me explain.
Number 1, the weather.
<LINE,33>For five turns after using <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>SUNNY DAY<COL1,POP>,\nthe power of FIRE-type moves is x 1.5.
<LINE,33>Likewise, for five turns after using\n<COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>RAIN DANCE<COL1,POP>, the power of WATER-type\nmoves is multiplied by 1.5.
<LINE,33>Three moves change the weather: <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>SANDSTORM<COL1,POP>,\n<COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>SUNNY DAY<COL1,POP> and <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>RAIN DANCE<COL1,POP>. Don't worry--\nthese weather conditions will not double or\ntriple. Let's see what happens to the damage\nmultiplier of 12 if these occur. The multiplier\nis 12 x 1.5 = 18. So, with the right conditions,\na move could inflict x 18 the usual damage.
Number 2, held items.
<LINE,33>Certain items, like <COL1,PUSH,180,255,134,255>MIRACLE SEED<COL1,POP> or\n<COL1,PUSH,180,255,134,255>CHARCOAL<COL1,POP>, boost specific types of moves \nx 1.1. This multiplier also applies to the\ncombined damage, including the weather.
<LINE,33>There are also items that affect only\nspecific kinds of POKéMON. For instance,\n<COL1,PUSH,180,255,134,255>LIGHT BALL<COL1,POP> doubles the power of\n<COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>PIKACHU<COL1,POP>'s special attacks.
<LINE,33>Let's see how the combined damage multiplier\nworks. Consider a case in which a\n<COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>PIKACHU<COL1,POP> HOLDs a <COL1,PUSH,180,255,134,255>LIGHT BALL<COL1,POP>.
<LINE,33>Wow, that certainly is extreme. So be wary of\nthese three POKéMON: <COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>PIKACHU<COL1,POP>, <COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>CUBONE<COL1,POP>,\nand <COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>MAROWAK<COL1,POP>.
Pika? Pika?
<LINE,33>The PSYCHIC-type move <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>PSYWAVE<COL1,POP> is an\ninteresting move. At its weakest, it can\ninflict only 1HP damage. At its\nstrongest, it inflicts damage that is\n1.5 times the normal level.
<LINE,33>Also, if a move like <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>MIND READER<COL1,POP> or <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>LOCK-ON<COL1,POP>\nis used, the attack move in the next turn will\nstrike even a flying POKéMON, or a POKéMON\nunder the ground.
<LINE,33>Do you use support moves? These include\nmoves that lower the opponent's stats,\ninduce sleep, cause confusion, and so on. I\nlove them. Did you know that, by and large,\nthere are two major kinds of support moves\nthat are intended for use against\nopponents?
<LINE,33>There are two types of support moves.\nOnes that:\n-Work regardless of the type match-up\n-Are affected by the type match-up
<LINE,33>You do remember type match-ups, I hope? For\nexample, PSYCHIC-type moves have zero\neffect on DARK-type POKéMON. So in this\ncase, moves such as <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>PSYBEAM<COL1,POP> and <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>PSYCHIC<COL1,POP>\nwon't work.
<LINE,33>However, there are also support moves that\naren't affected by type match-ups. These\nmoves will work on any type of POKéMON. For\nexample, <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>HYPNOSIS<COL1,POP> will make even DARK-type\nPOKéMON sleep.
<LINE,33>There are other exceptional moves besides\nthese, so please do be careful.

<LINE,33>There are also support moves that are\naffected by type match-ups. Depending on\nthe POKéMON's type, these moves may not\nwork at all.
<LINE,33>For example, <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>THUNDER WAVE<COL1,POP> will never have\nany effect on GROUND-type POKéMON. After\nall, the type match-up of an ELECTRIC-type\nmove on a GROUND-type POKéMON is the\nworst--it won't have any effect.
<LINE,33>In a similar fashion, the POISON-type\nsupport moves <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>POISON GAS<COL1,POP>, <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>TOXIC<COL1,POP>, and\n<COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>POISONPOWDER<COL1,POP> have no effect on STEEL-type\nPOKéMON. There are other support moves of\nthis nature.
<LINE,33>So how do you tell these two kinds of support\nmoves apart? Look at the message that\nappears if a move doesn't work. It could say,\n"It didn't affect (POKéMON)" or\n"It doesn't affect (POKéMON)."
<LINE,33>If "It didn't affect (POKéMON)"\nappears, your move was not affected by\nthe type match-up. It just failed.
<LINE,33>If "It doesn't affect (POKéMON)"\nappears, your move is affected by the\ntype match-up. It will never work on\nthat type of POKéMON.
It gets confused!
<COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>CONFUSE RAY<COL1,POP>!!
<LINE,33>In general, a speedy POKéMON\nenjoys an advantage since it can attack\nfirst. However, you can make up for slowness\nby using the right moves and tactics. Let me\nshare some of my best tactics.
If you wish to attack before your opponent...
<LINE,33>The three moves <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>QUICK ATTACK<COL1,POP>,\n<COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>EXTREMESPEED<COL1,POP> and <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>MACH PUNCH<COL1,POP> enable\nthe user to attack first.
<LINE,33><COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>AGILITY<COL1,POP> boosts the user's SPEED.
<LINE,33>You can also lower the opponent's SPEED\nby using a support move like <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>SCARY FACE<COL1,POP>\nor the added effects of a move such as\n<COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>ICY WIND<COL1,POP>.
<LINE,33>Paralyzing the opponent also sharply\nreduces its SPEED.
Use these tactics to move before your foe.
<LINE,33>If your POKéMON can act first, you won't\nhave to fear moves like <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>PAIN SPLIT<COL1,POP> or\n<COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>REVERSAL<COL1,POP>. Just make sure you knock out the\nopponent before it can use these moves.
<LINE,33>You can also avoid <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>DESTINY BOND<COL1,POP>, a move that\nmakes the foe faint if the user faints. Again,\njust defeat the foe before it can use this.
<LINE,33>Incidentally, #71there are also moves and\ntactics that don't depend on SPEED or which\nPOKéMON moves first<COL1,POP><COL2,POP>. Let's examine some of\nthese.
<LINE,33>The move <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>PERISH SONG<COL1,POP> causes both POKéMON\nto faint three turns later. However, its\neffect wears off if the POKéMON switch out.\nTherefore, you should make it impossible\nfor the opponent to switch beforehand.
<LINE,33>If a POKéMON uses <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>BIDE<COL1,POP>, it takes whatever\ndamage the foe inflicts for two to three\nturns, then releases that built-up energy to\ninflict double the damage it's taken.
<LINE,33><COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>COUNTER<COL1,POP> and <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>MIRROR COAT<COL1,POP> are retaliation\nmoves. One strikes back with double damage\nagainst physical attacks, one against special\nattacks. Also, these moves are always used in\nthe bottom of the turn after the foe's move.
<LINE,33><COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>FUTURE SIGHT<COL1,POP> is an attack move that strikes\ntwo turns after use. It is not affected by\ntype match-ups. Therefore, its effect is not\nmultiplied by 1.5 if used by a PSYCHIC-type\nPOKéMON. It works on all\nPOKéMON types including\nDARK and FIGHTING.
<LINE,33>That about wraps it up. Pardon?\nYou want to know more?\nWell, um... \nOh, look at the time! \nI have to go!
<LINE,33>A POKéMON that has learned different types\nof moves should be able to battle effectively\nagainst any type of POKéMON. You'll come to\nappreciate this, I'm sure.
<LINE,33>Perhaps I should use some examples to\nshow you what I mean?
1 - #71Teach a POKéMON a move it hates<COL1,POP><COL2,POP>
<LINE,33>Try teaching your POKéMON moves that they\nthemselves are vulnerable to. For example,\ntake a WATER-type POKéMON that is weak\nagainst ELECTRIC moves. A <COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>STARMIE<COL1,POP>,\nperhaps. We'll teach it the ELECTRIC move\n<COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>THUNDER<COL1,POP>.
<LINE,33>If it battles an opponent of the same type,\nthis move gives it a strong edge. Even better,\nit can catch the opponent completely off\nguard.
<LINE,33>There are many other combinations.\n-<COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>CUBONE<COL1,POP> with the ICE-type <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>BLIZZARD<COL1,POP>\n-<COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>ARBOK<COL1,POP> with the GROUND-type move\n<COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>EARTHQUAKE<COL1,POP>...
2 - #71Aim for the weak spots of POKéMON<COL1,POP><COL2,POP>
<LINE,33>Teach your POKéMON a move that will exploit\nthe weak point of a POKéMON that has a type\nmatch-up advantage. For example, WATER-\ntype POKéMON are weak against ELECTRIC\nattacks. So, teach a WATER POKéMON a \nGROUND-type move, which is super-effective.
<LINE,33>A foe who chooses to use an ELECTRIC type\nagainst your WATER type will be surprised. A\nGROUND-type move like <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>EARTHQUAKE<COL1,POP> that the\nELECTRIC-type hates is suddenly sprung...
There are other combinations, too.
<LINE,33>The GRASS-type POKéMON <COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>MEGANIUM<COL1,POP> is weak\nagainst ICE-type attacks. A good remedy\nwould be to teach it a STEEL-type move\n<COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>IRON TAIL<COL1,POP>, which is "super-effective"\nagainst ICE-type POKéMON.
<LINE,33>The DARK-type POKéMON <COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>UMBREON<COL1,POP> is at a\ndisadvantage against FIGHTING-type\nPOKéMON. So teach it a PSYCHIC-type move\nlike <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>PSYCHIC<COL1,POP>. FIGHTING-type POKéMON are\nweak against PSYCHIC-type moves, correct?
<LINE,33>Using these kinds of methods, it may be\npossible to take on a POKéMON that has a\ntype advantage. At least it never hurts to\ntry.
ELECTRIC-type <COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>FLAAFFY<COL1,POP>!
But here comes an\n<COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>EARTHQUAKE<COL1,POP>!
Ah, yes.
<LINE,33>Have you heard the term "Combo"?  It refers\nto a combination of moves. Today, I will teach\nyou some very effective combos.
<LINE,33>For example, try this combo: <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>DEFENSE CURL<COL1,POP>\nand <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>ROLLOUT<COL1,POP>. The ROCK-type move <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>ROLLOUT<COL1,POP>,\nwhen used after <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>DEFENSE CURL<COL1,POP>...
<LINE,33>Or try these. I call them sure-hit combos.
<LINE,33>First, use a move that ensures that the next\nattack will hit. Try a move like <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>LOCK-ON<COL1,POP> or\n<COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>MIND READER<COL1,POP>. Complete the combo with\nan inaccurate but powerful move such as\n<COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>ZAP CANNON<COL1,POP> or <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>DYNAMICPUNCH<COL1,POP>.
<LINE,33>The power of the combo will be incredible. I\nwould switch to a POKéMON that is hopefully\nunaffected by the attack move's type.
<LINE,33>Now, endurance combos. <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>ENDURE<COL1,POP> leaves the\nuser with at least 1HP after any attack.\nCombine it with moves that become more\npowerful if the user's HP falls, such as\n<COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>REVERSAL<COL1,POP>, <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>FLAIL<COL1,POP> and <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>PAIN SPLIT<COL1,POP>.
<LINE,33>However, these combos are vulnerable if your\nPOKéMON is attacked first. I think the smart\nthing to do is to raise your SPEED in advance.
<LINE,33>Sleeper combos... These are combos that\ninvolve healing moves. If HP is low after using\na move such as <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>BELLY DRUM<COL1,POP> or <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>CURSE<COL1,POP>, use\n<COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>REST<COL1,POP>.
<LINE,33>It would be even more effective if the sleep-\ning POKéMON had an attack move like <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>SLEEP\nTALK<COL1,POP> or <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>SNORE<COL1,POP> or was HOLDing a <COL1,PUSH,180,255,134,255>MINT BERRY<COL1,POP>.
<LINE,33>Creeper combos... Start with a move that\ninflicts damage every turn, such as <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>TOXIC<COL1,POP> or\n<COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>SANDSTORM<COL1,POP>.
<LINE,33>The last half of the combo could be a move\nthat causes a status problem like confusion\nor sleep. Or you could concentrate on your\nown defense. Either way, you're certain to\ninfuriate your opponent!
<COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>SANDSTORM<COL1,POP> + <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>BIND<COL1,POP>!!

<LINE,33>The <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>PURSUIT<COL1,POP> combo. The DARK-type move\n<COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>PURSUIT<COL1,POP> inflicts double damage if the\nopponent switches out.
<LINE,33>So, the thing to do beforehand is to use\na move that prompts switching.
<LINE,33>For example, lead with a move like\n<COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>PERISH SONG<COL1,POP> or <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>SANDSTORM<COL1,POP>. Moves that\ncause status problems are also effective.
<LINE,33>There are many other combos. Try to devise\nyour own! (If you do, keep them a secret to\nshare with just me.)
<LINE,33>Did you know that there are moves that vary\nwith the target's status or the weather? And\nthere are combos that depend on the\nsituation. Let me explain.
Combinations with the opponent's status
<LINE,33>If the opponent uses <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>MINIMIZE<COL1,POP>,\n<COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>STOMP<COL1,POP> it to inflict double the damage.
<LINE,33>Against a sleeping opponent,\nmoves like <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>NIGHTMARE<COL1,POP> and\n<COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>DREAM EATER<COL1,POP> work superbly.\nIf the opponent uses <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>REST<COL1,POP>,\nthese moves will come as\nnasty surprises.
<LINE,33>Next, combos that work with the weather.\nFirst, combos that start with <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>SUNNY DAY<COL1,POP>.
<LINE,33>When the sunlight turns harsh after using\n<COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>SUNNY DAY<COL1,POP>...
<LINE,33>The power of FIRE-type moves is\nmultiplied by 1.5. In contrast, the power\nof WATER-type moves is halved.
<LINE,33><COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>MORNING SUN<COL1,POP>, <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>SYNTHESIS<COL1,POP> and\n<COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>MOONLIGHT<COL1,POP> will provide double the usual\nHP-restoring power. In STADIUM, these\nmoves will fully heal HP.
<LINE,33><COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>SOLARBEAM<COL1,POP>, which normally takes two\nturns, will be useable every turn. In\ncontrast, <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>THUNDER<COL1,POP>'s accuracy will drop,\nso it would hit only about half the time.
Also, POKéMON will not become frozen.
When it is pouring after using <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>RAIN DANCE<COL1,POP>...
<LINE,33>The power of WATER-type moves is\nmultiplied by 1.5. Conversely, the power of\nFIRE-type moves is cut in half.
<LINE,33>The HP-recovery moves <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>MORNING SUN<COL1,POP>,\n<COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>SYNTHESIS<COL1,POP> and <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>MOONLIGHT<COL1,POP> are affected\nby the downpour. Their performance is cut\nin half. In STADIUM, these moves will only\nheal one quarter of the \nuser's maximum HP.
<LINE,33>The power of <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>SOLARBEAM<COL1,POP> will be cut in\nhalf, but <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>THUNDER<COL1,POP> won't miss.
<LINE,33>If your POKéMON is weak against FIRE-type\nmoves, you can use this move for added\ndefense. Incidentally, a weather-altering\nmove never fails, so there's nothing to worry\nabout when using it.
<LINE,33>Now, here are some combos that can be\nperformed under special situations. Quite\noften, a single POKéMON won't be able to do\nthem. If so, switch to another POKéMON.
<LINE,33>For example, make <COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>TOGEPI<COL1,POP> use <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>SAFEGUARD<COL1,POP>,\nthen switch it with <COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>MANKEY<COL1,POP>. Make this\nPOKéMON use <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>THRASH<COL1,POP>. This will prevent\n<COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>MANKEY<COL1,POP> from becoming confused after it uses\n<COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>THRASH<COL1,POP>. This is an example of a combo\nfeaturing a move that remains in effect if\nthe user switches out.
<LINE,33>Combos represent the skill and wisdom\nof trainers. I hope you will try to create\nyour own beautiful combos like the ones I\ndemonstrated for you.
<LINE,33>If you are willing to waste one turn to switch\nPOKéMON in battle, it is best to bring out a\nPOKéMON that is completely unaffected by\nthe opponent's attack. That is the\ndefense-first switching style which appears\nto be popular now. I believe I taught you this\nalready?
<LINE,33>However, it goes without saying that you will\nnever win by just defending. You should\nconsider #71offense-minded switching<COL1,POP><COL2,POP>.
<LINE,33>Let me illustrate. Let's assume you have an\nELECTRIC-type POKéMON out.
Pika!
And let's assume the foe uses a GROUND type.
Cuuu!
<LINE,33>Your ELECTRIC type is at an obvious dis-\nadvantage. Your first instinct would probably\nbe to switch it with a FLYING type that is\nunaffected by GROUND-type moves... Ahem!\nLet's stop and think about this.
<LINE,33>While it is true that the FLYING type is\nunaffected by GROUND-type attacks, the\ntype match-up of the FLYING type against\nthe GROUND type is neutral. In other words,\nyou won't be able to attack effectively.
<LINE,33>If I were you, I would not hesitate to send\nout a GRASS-type POKéMON.
Suuuuun!
<LINE,33>GROUND-type moves can only inflict half\ntheir usual damage on GRASS-type POKéMON.\nOn the other hand, GRASS-type attacks\ninflict double the usual damage on GROUND-\ntype POKéMON. This is what I mean by\n#71offense-minded switching<COL1,POP><COL2,POP>. Wonderful!
<LINE,33>However, do keep in mind that the opponent's\nattacks are only reduced in power, not made\nineffective.
<LINE,33>Do you choose to give priority to defense or\ntake offense even at the expense of some\ndamage? You should evaluate your current\nsituation before choosing between them.
<LINE,33>Hm? It's no good unless you have different\nkinds of POKéMON.
<LINE,33>For example, <COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>SUNKERN<COL1,POP> learns <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>GIGA DRAIN<COL1,POP> at\nLevel 46. However, if it evolves into\n<COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>SUNFLORA<COL1,POP>...
<LINE,33>Attacking the type match-up weaknesses of\nPOKéMON is a basic strategy. However,\ndepending on the situation, doing so isn't\nnecessarily the best course of action. Allow\nme to explain.
<LINE,33>For example, consider a battle between a\n<COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>TAUROS<COL1,POP> and a <COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>MANTINE<COL1,POP>.
NORMAL
WATER/FLYING
<LINE,33>Let's assume <COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>TAUROS<COL1,POP> used a TM to learn the\nELECTRIC-type move <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>THUNDER<COL1,POP>. You would\nprobably consider yourself lucky. After all,\n<COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>MANTINE<COL1,POP>'s two types, WATER and FLYING,\nare both weak against ELECTRIC-type\nattacks. That means the ELECTRIC-type\nmove will have its power quadrupled.
<LINE,33>That certainly sounds wonderful. But hold on\njust one second. Don't be fooled by the\nsituation's allure. <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>THUNDER<COL1,POP> is a special\nattack. That means the amount of damage is\ndetermined by the stats SPCL.ATK and\nSPCL.DEF.
<LINE,33>Let's check these stats. <COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>TAUROS<COL1,POP>'s SPCL.ATK\nis rather low. On the other hand, consider\n<COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>MANTINE<COL1,POP>'s SPCL.DEF. It is very high. All of a\nsudden, the move loses its appeal.\nFurthermore, I don't think <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>THUNDER<COL1,POP> is a move\nthat will hit very often.
<LINE,33>In this case, rather than exploiting a type\nmatch-up weakness, it may be better to use a\nNORMAL-type move. The power of the\nNORMAL-type move will be multiplied by\n1.5 because of the type match. For example,\nmoves like <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>DOUBLE-EDGE<COL1,POP> and <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>BODY SLAM<COL1,POP>\nmay be more effective.
<LINE,33>The type match-up and stats... Which kind of\nweakness should be exploited? Learn to read\nthe situation thoroughly before committing\nyourself to the next move.
<LINE,33>Today's topic is rather difficult, so listen\ncarefully. Pardon? They're always hard? Oh,\nplease don't be that way. Just think of it as\ntough love.
<LINE,33>Today's topic is "Reading Your Rival." I'll\nteach you to predict your opponent's next\nmove, then attack accordingly. 
<COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>MEGANIUM<COL1,POP>'s case
<LINE,33>A battle has gotten underway with the\nGRASS-type <COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>MEGANIUM<COL1,POP> facing off against the\nWATER-type <COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>AZUMARILL<COL1,POP>.
<LINE,33>Naturally, people would want to\nuse a GRASS-type move that is super-\neffective against WATER-type POKéMON. For\ninstance, a move like <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>RAZOR LEAF<COL1,POP> would be\ndandy.
<LINE,33>But wait just a moment. Consider things from\nyour opponent's perspective. If it were you,\nwouldn't you want to switch out? Not only\nthat, wouldn't you think about sending out a\nFIRE-type POKéMON that is strong against\nthe GRASS-type?
<LINE,33>Against a FIRE-type POKéMON, a GRASS-type\nmove's power is halved. It's rather vexing.\nWhat should you do about it?
<LINE,33>I would use a NORMAL-type move that is\nequally effective against the WATER type and\nFIRE type. In other words, a move that would\nbe just as effective whether the opponent\nswitches out or not. For example, I would use\na NORMAL-type move such as <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>BODY SLAM<COL1,POP>.
<LINE,33>Against most POKéMON types, a NORMAL-type\nmove's damage multiplier is one. So if you want\nto be sure to inflict damage, a NORMAL-type\nmove works quite well.
<COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>FERALIGATR<COL1,POP>'s case
<LINE,33>Let's look at another battle. Suppose you\nhave sent out the WATER-type <COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>FERALIGATR<COL1,POP>.\nYour opponent has led with the FIRE-type\n<COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>RAPIDASH<COL1,POP>.
<LINE,33>Again, let's try to guess what your opponent\nis thinking. It's likely that your opponent will\nswitch out and put in an ELECTRIC-type\nPOKéMON that is tough against your\nWATER-type POKéMON.
<LINE,33>I would suggest using a GROUND-type move\nthat is super-effective against both FIRE-\ntype and ELECTRIC-type POKéMON. By doing\nso, it wouldn't matter if my opponent\nswitched or not. For example, I would use a\nmove like <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>EARTHQUAKE<COL1,POP>.
<LINE,33>Do you see? A <COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>FERALIGATR<COL1,POP> with <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>EARTHQUAKE<COL1,POP>.\nOutsmarting your foes begins with the moves\nyou choose to teach to your POKéMON.
<LINE,33>This is how trainers will try to anticipate\neach other's actions in high-level battles.\nDetermine what POKéMON your opponent has\nchosen, then use moves in anticipation of\nwhat he or she may do in battle.
<LINE,33>Ah, I seem to have run out of topics. You\nmust stop relying on me for all the answers.\nTo become a full-fledged POKéMON trainer in\nyour own right, you must think and decide for\nyourself. Now...
<LINE,33>It is up to you to do your best from now on!
<LINE,33>That boosts the power of the ROCK-type\nmove <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>ROLLOUT<COL1,POP> by ten percent.
<LINE,33>&
<LINE,33>A GHOST-type move is a physical attack. Its\npower depends on its ATTACK stats.
<LINE,33>Not only that, its SPCL.ATK stat is high.\nPSYCHIC-type moves should make your\nPOKéMON a tough customer indeed.

<COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>BONE RUSH<COL1,POP>!!
<LINE,33>I suggest deliberately delaying evolution\ntill your POKéMON learn some good moves.
<LINE,33>If you switch out a POKéMON, then switch\nit in again, it will be cured of any status\nproblem. Don't forget that.
<LINE,33>At Level 31, it learns <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>PETAL DANCE<COL1,POP>. If\nyou want it to learn this move, it can't\nlearn <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>GIGA DRAIN<COL1,POP>.
<LINE,33>These moves inflict damage, but they also\nreturn half the HP of that damage to\nthe user. So in a way, they can be\nconsidered healing moves.
<LINE,33>Rather than the special attack <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>PSYCHIC<COL1,POP>,\nthe physical attack <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>HEADBUTT<COL1,POP> should be\nable to inflict more damage.
<LINE,33>The attack's power is doubled! This kind\nof move combination is known as a combo,\nand it can be very useful in battle.
<LINE,33>You can also create combos using moves\nlike <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>MEAN LOOK<COL1,POP>, <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>WRAP<COL1,POP> and <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>WHIRLPOOL<COL1,POP>.
<LINE,33>For example, you'll be able to see a\n<COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>HOPPIP<COL1,POP> that knows <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>PAY DAY<COL1,POP>.
<LINE,33><COL1,PUSH,180,255,134,255>THICK CLUB<COL1,POP> doubles the physical attack\npower of <COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>CUBONE<COL1,POP> and <COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>MAROWAK<COL1,POP>.

<LINE,33>When choosing three POKéMON for battle,\ndo you know what to do?
<LINE,33>Do you know what to do once the\nbattle starts?
<LINE,33>When this screen appears, choose a\nPOKéMON by pressing the button shown\nbeside it.
<LINE,33>For example, to choose <COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>LICKITUNG<COL1,POP>,\npress the <COL1,PUSH,110,154,255,255>B Button<COL1,POP>. If you want to use\n<COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>FLAAFFY<COL1,POP>, press the <COL1,PUSH,110,154,255,255>A Button<COL1,POP>.
<LINE,33>To check your choices, press the\n<COL1,PUSH,110,154,255,255>R Button<COL1,POP>. Their names will become yellow.
<LINE,33>You can see details about your party\nPOKéMON, such as their stats and moves.\nHold down the <COL1,PUSH,110,154,255,255>R Button<COL1,POP>, then select the\nPOKéMON you want to check.
<LINE,33>If you want to pick different battle\nPOKéMON, press the <COL1,PUSH,110,154,255,255>L Button<COL1,POP>. That will\ncancel all of your previous selections.
<LINE,33>Once you have chosen your three battle\nPOKéMON, you're ready for showtime!
<LINE,33>Remember, POKéMON line up in the order\nthey are chosen. That means the first\nPOKéMON you choose will also be the first\nto battle. Think hard before you choose\nthe order.
<LINE,33>You'll choose your action on this screen.\nIf you choose to battle by pressing\nthe <COL1,PUSH,110,154,255,255>A Button<COL1,POP>...
<LINE,33>This menu will appear. Press the <COL1,PUSH,110,154,255,255>L Button<COL1,POP>\nto return to the previous screen.\nPress the <COL1,PUSH,110,154,255,255>R Button<COL1,POP> to check your moves.
<LINE,33>For a detailed description of a move,\npress the <COL1,PUSH,110,154,255,255>+ Control Pad<COL1,POP> in the same\ndirection as the move's position.
<LINE,33>When you have decided which move to use,\npress the appropriate <COL1,PUSH,110,154,255,255>C Button<COL1,POP>\nto use it.
<LINE,33>Even after you choose, as long as your\nopponent hasn't chosen a move yet, you\ncan press the <COL1,PUSH,110,154,255,255>L Button<COL1,POP> to cancel your\nselection.
<LINE,33>You may also decide to switch POKéMON.\nThis step is not much different than\nchoosing a move.
<LINE,33>Press the <COL1,PUSH,110,154,255,255>R Button<COL1,POP> to choose the\nPOKéMON to be switched in. Press\nthe <COL1,PUSH,110,154,255,255>+ Control  Pad<COL1,POP> to get detailed\ninformation on your POKéMON.

<LINE,33>There is a DAY CARE business on ROUTE 34. If\nyou leave a male and a female POKéMON there,\nyou might find an EGG when you return. Under\nwhat conditions will an EGG be made? Let me\ntell you.
<LINE,33>An EGG may be found if the male and female\nPOKéMON are somewhat similar in appearance.\nFor example, the pair could be a <COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>PIKACHU<COL1,POP> and\na <COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>SANDSLASH<COL1,POP>, or an <COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>ELECTABUZZ<COL1,POP> and a\n<COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>MAGMAR<COL1,POP>.
<LINE,33>POKéMON that do not look anything like each\nother, such as a <COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>BUTTERFREE<COL1,POP> and a\n<COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>GIRAFARIG<COL1,POP>, will show no interest in each\nother. A pair like that will not make an EGG.
<LINE,33>A POKéMON pair that has a possibility of\nmaking an EGG is called an #71EGG group<COL1,POP><COL2,POP>. If a\nPOKéMON pair is not of the same #71EGG group<COL1,POP><COL2,POP>,\nthey will not make an EGG. You can study EGG\ngroups at the LIBRARY.
<LINE,33>By the way, a POKéMON that hatched from an\nEGG may have more moves by the time it\nreaches Level 5 than a regular POKéMON\nwould. It may even have the same moves as its\nparents. What kinds of extra moves may be\nlearned?
<LINE,33>Number one, #71TM moves<COL1,POP><COL2,POP>. If the\nPOKéMON in the EGG can learn a TM\nmove and its male parent knows that\nsame move, the baby will be born with\nthat move.
<LINE,33>Number two, #71moves learned by\nleveling up<COL1,POP><COL2,POP>. If the POKéMON in the\nEGG can learn a certain move by\nleveling up and both parents know the\nsame move, the baby will be born with\nthat move already learned.
<LINE,33>If four or more moves can be inherited, moves\nthe POKéMON would normally learn before\nLevel 5 will be forgotten, starting with the\none learned at the oldest.
<LINE,33>Incidentally, a POKéMON that comes from an\nEGG will be hatched as a completely unevolved\nform of the female parent.
<LINE,33>If, for example, the female POKéMON is a\n<COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>RATICATE<COL1,POP>, the EGG baby will be a <COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>RATTATA<COL1,POP>. All\nbaby POKéMON will hatch at level 5. That will\ngive you plenty of opportunities to raise\nthem the way you want. Some POKéMON only\nhatch from EGGs. Wouldn't you like to see\nthem?
<LINE,33>As you know, if you leave a male and female\nPOKéMON of the same EGG group at a\nDAY CARE, you might come back to find an EGG.\nLet me tell you a few additional things I know\nabout EGGs.
<LINE,33>If you're wondering why your POKéMON have\nnot made an EGG, go out into the DAY CARE's\nyard to see how well they are getting along.
<LINE,33>There is a possibility that you will find an\nEGG if your POKéMON:\n-Appears to care for (POKéMON)\n-Is friendly with (POKéMON)\n-It shows interest in (POKéMON)
<LINE,33>An EGG will never be found if your POKéMON:\n-It has no interest in (POKéMON)\n-It's brimming with energy
<LINE,33>My own experience tells me that a male and a\nfemale of the same kind of POKéMON tend to\nbecome friendly toward each other.
<LINE,33>The paired POKéMON also tend to become\nfriendly toward each other if they were\ncaught by different trainers. Using these\ntips should help you find EGGS.
<LINE,33>Now let me tell you about a big secret.
<LINE,33>A POKéMON hatched from an EGG may know\nmoves that it normally wouldn't learn by\nleveling up or by using a TM!
<LINE,33>It appears that baby POKéMON inherit moves\nfrom their male parents. My, EGGS are so\nstrange! These oddly inherited moves are\nknown as #71EGG moves<COL1,POP><COL2,POP>.
<LINE,33>An #71EGG move<COL1,POP><COL2,POP> is a move that a baby POKéMON\nhas inherited from its male parent when it\nhatches. The #71EGG moves<COL1,POP><COL2,POP> that a baby\nPOKéMON can learn depends on what kind of\nPOKéMON it is. If the male parent knows the\nsame kind of move, the baby POKéMON will\nalready know the move when it hatches.
<LINE,33>If you teach EGG moves properly, you could\nbreed a <COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>HORSEA<COL1,POP> that knows <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>OCTAZOOKA<COL1,POP>...
<LINE,33>Does that surprise you? Why don't you go to\nthe LIBRARY and check the EGG moves that\nvarious kinds of POKéMON can learn.
<LINE,33>Like everything else, you should start off on\nthe right foot in a POKéMON battle. If three\nPOKéMON are to go into battle, you should\nbe excited from the moment you send out your\nlead-off POKéMON. Wouldn't you agree?
<LINE,33>Fine. Then what kind of POKéMON would be\nideal as your leading battler?
<LINE,33>Now, some of you may think that you should\njust send out your favorite POKéMON\nwhenever you like. And you certainly can do\nthat. But hold on just one second. Wouldn't\nyou feel sad if your POKéMON were defeated\nright away because its weaknesses were\nexploited?
<LINE,33>That's why I personally use a POKéMON\nwith few weak aspects as my lead-off\nbattler.
<LINE,33>For example, I recommend a NORMAL-type or\nan ELECTRIC-type POKéMON because they\nhave few type match-up weaknesses.
<LINE,33>If a POKéMON has few type mismatches,\nit means that there is less chance that its\nweak points will be exploited. In turn, that\nalso means you won't have to switch it out to\nget away from a type mismatch.
<LINE,33>If you don't know what kind of POKéMON your\nopponent will send out first, you should\nconsider my recommendation.
ELECTRIC-type POKéMON : <COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>FLAAFFY<COL1,POP>
Flaaf? Flaaf?
<LINE,33>Also, from my own experience, it is convenient\nfor your party to have at least one POKéMON\nthat would be unaffected by a certain type\nof move, depending on the type match-up.
<LINE,33>For example, a GROUND-type POKéMON that is\nunaffected by any ELECTRIC-type move or a\nFLYING-type POKéMON that can't be hit by a\nGROUND-type move. If a POKéMON can avoid\ndamage entirely due to a type match-up, the\nbattle is likely to be tipped in your favor.
<LINE,33>Welcome to the GYM LEADER CLASS! Since you\nkeep attending my classes, I guess you must\nlike what I have to offer. I certainly am glad!\nToday I would like to talk about types. The\nlesson is a little long, so please do try to\nstay awake.

<LINE,24>I just love GRASS-type POKéMON. Betcha don't know what\ntypes of POKéMON are tough against the GRASS type!
<LINE,24>Wow, you really showed me the weak points of GRASS-type\nPOKéMON.
<LINE,24>Your win earlier was just a fluke. I'll use my GRASS-type\nPOKéMON again!
<LINE,24>Wow, you really know how to exploit the weaknesses of\nGRASS-type POKéMON...
<LINE,24>A decisive victory without a single\nKO'd POKéMON! How beautiful!
<LINE,24>You picked your POKéMON\nperfectly! That was a beautiful\nvictory!
<LINE,24>Shucks! I lost this time, but just you wait!\nI won't let it happen again!
<LINE,24>Hmm... Not too beautiful. It seems\nthat not all of your POKéMON are\ntough against the GRASS type. 
<LINE,24>Don't you know the weak points of GRASS-type POKéMON?\nMaybe you should look up type match-ups at the LIBRARY.
<LINE,24>What's the matter?\nYou chose POKéMON that are\nstrong against the GRASS type,\nright?
<LINE,24>I'm studying the weaknesses of FIRE-type POKéMON.\nWould you help me, please?
<LINE,24>Thank you for showing me some moves that are tough\nagainst FIRE POKéMON... (...fizzle...)
<LINE,24>Uh-oh. The test we performed earlier was a failure. Try\nanother move that's tough against FIRE-type POKéMON?
<LINE,24>I finally know the weak points of FIRE POKéMON... But now\nI'm all burnt out from studying... (fizzle...)
<LINE,24>Magnificent! A perfect victory!\nYou are quite good. Beautiful!
<LINE,24>Your POKéMON choices were just\nright. You came so close to a\nperfect victory.
<LINE,24>It was sheer coincidence that you beat me. Logic proves\nmy point!
<LINE,24>Hmm... Not too beautiful. I believe\nyou could choose better POKéMON\ncombinations.
<LINE,24>Hee, hee, hee! Don't you even know type match-ups? Well,\nif you don't know, I'm not about to tell you!
<LINE,24>Oh? Do you know what types of\nmoves are super-effective against\nFIRE-type POKéMON?
<LINE,24>There are many different types of POKéMON in my party.\nThere's no way you can pick on a weak point!
<LINE,24>You picked on our weak points perfectly! I'm surprised\nyou know so much about type match-ups.
<LINE,24>You have to be smart and go after my POKéMON's weak\nspots. Otherwise, you're never gonna hurt my team!
<LINE,24>This isn't good... I never imagined there could be someone\nwho would know so much about type match-ups...
<LINE,24>Bravo! You did an excellent job of\nexploiting your opponent's\nweaknesses. That certainly was a\nperfect victory.
<LINE,24>Your POKéMON choices were right\non the mark! You zeroed in on your\nopponent's weak points perfectly!
<LINE,24>This... This must be a mistake! I'm not going to lose like\nthat next time!
<LINE,24>Hmm... Not too beautiful. Perhaps\nyou should think a little harder\nwhen choosing your POKéMON.
<LINE,24>Ha, ha, ha! That was pretty sad! Go check type match-ups\nat the LIBRARY.
<LINE,24>You should switch your POKéMON\nduring battle to gain type\nmatch-up advantages over your\nopponent.
<LINE,24>Listen here! <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>ACID ARMOR<COL1,POP> and <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>BARRIER<COL1,POP> add up to the\nperfect defense! Let's see you try to break through it!
<LINE,24>...You won! I should have remembered about set damage\nmoves.
<LINE,24>I fooled around last time. But now my <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>ACID ARMOR<COL1,POP> and\n<COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>BARRIER<COL1,POP> plan is ready for Round 2!
<LINE,24>It doesn't matter how high you raise your defenses if\nyour opponent uses set damage moves... (...glub...)
<LINE,24>A perfect victory earned by seeing\nthrough the opponent's strategy.\nMagnificent! And beautiful!
<LINE,24>Your POKéMON choices were\nimpeccable. You were smart to use\nset damage moves!
<LINE,24>I got careless and lost. The way you won just isn't fair!
<LINE,24>Hmm... Not too pretty. Perhaps\nthere are better ways to choose\nPOKéMON. Wouldn't you agree?
<LINE,24>You're not helping me train... I'll try these moves on a\nlady swimmer next time.
<LINE,24>Oh? Don't you know about moves\nthat inflict damage regardless of\ndefensive stats?
<LINE,24><COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>SOLARBEAM<COL1,POP> and <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>SKULL BASH<COL1,POP>... If they hit, they'll KO\nanything! Think you can dodge 'em?
<LINE,24>The way you dodged my <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>SOLARBEAM<COL1,POP> and <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>SKULL BASH<COL1,POP>...\nYou're incredible!
<LINE,24>Oh, it's you again! My <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>SOLARBEAM<COL1,POP> and <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>SKULL BASH<COL1,POP> aren't\nbeaten yet!
<LINE,24>Oh, right... You could dodge an attack by using <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>FLY<COL1,POP> or\n<COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>DIG<COL1,POP>.
<LINE,24>You saw through your opponent's\nplan and came through for a\nflawless win. Beautiful!
<LINE,24>Your POKéMON choices were right\non! You were able to read your\nopponent's plan exactly! Beautiful!
<LINE,24>Rats! But my strategy wasn't a total failure!
<LINE,24>Hmm... Not too beautiful. Think\nabout the way you chose your\nparty... Perhaps you left an open-\ning for your opponent to exploit?
<LINE,24>Yeah! That worked perfectly! What do you think? Wasn't it\na great move?
<LINE,24>There are moves that, if timed\nproperly, will avoid an attack, then\nstrike the opponent.
<LINE,24><COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>AMNESIA<COL1,POP> is an amazing move. How do you plan to\ncounter it?
<LINE,24>You beat my <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>AMNESIA<COL1,POP>? I'll have to train even harder.
<LINE,24>This doesn't mean that <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>AMNESIA<COL1,POP> was defeated. Face me\nagain!
<LINE,24>I went to all the effort of using <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>AMNESIA<COL1,POP>... And you just\nused physical attacks? It's not fair!
<LINE,24>A perfect win without a single\nPOKéMON going down! Your skills\nare fabulous!
<LINE,24>Your POKéMON choices couldn't\nhave been better. Those physical\nattacks scored knockouts!
<LINE,24>Not bad... But wait 'til next time. I think you still have\nweak spots.
<LINE,24>Hmm...  Not too beautiful. Your\nPOKéMON choices left something to\nbe desired.
<LINE,24>Oh, yeah! See? Didn't I tell you <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>AMNESIA<COL1,POP> was great?
<LINE,24>Hmm... Do you understand the\ndifference between physical and\nspecial attacks?
<LINE,24>Hey, hey! I'm gonna <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>DOUBLE TEAM<COL1,POP> ya! You won't even touch\nmy POKéMON!
<LINE,24>So there's more than one way to make a move hit...? I've\ngotta work harder at this!
<LINE,24>It was a coincidence that you hit my POKéMON earlier!\nI'm gonna go with <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>DOUBLE TEAM<COL1,POP> again, I say. Again!
<LINE,24>There is a way to hit my POKéMON even after I use\n<COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>DOUBLE TEAM<COL1,POP>? That makes me double angry!
<LINE,24>You weren't fazed at all by your\nopponent's strategy. Your perfect\nwin was beautiful!
<LINE,24>Your choice of POKéMON was\nperfect, too. You broke up the\n<COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>DOUBLE TEAM<COL1,POP> in a most exemplary\nmanner!
<LINE,24>Hmph! I may have lost this time, but if we battle again,\nwatch out! That's right. Watch out!
<LINE,24>Not too beautiful! Perhaps you\nshould consider using only POKéMON\nthat can handle opponents that\nhave heightened evasiveness.
<LINE,24>How do you like the power of <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>DOUBLE TEAM<COL1,POP>? Your moves\nmissed over and over!
<LINE,24>There is a move that always hits.\nPerhaps you've heard of <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>SWIFT<COL1,POP>?
If you can't tell the difference between a real status\nproblem and one that's only similar, you'll never beat me!
<LINE,24>I've had enough of status problems like those. You really\nare something special.
<LINE,24>No, no. My POKéMON can take a lot more than that.
<LINE,24>You certainly gave me a harsh lesson on POKéMON\nconditions. (...sniff...)
<LINE,24>You have very good grasp on the\ndistinction between status\nproblems and similar conditions.
<LINE,24>You have a beautiful knowledge of\nconditions that are similar to\nstatus problems.
<LINE,24>You'll have to be a lot more thorough if you really want to\nbeat me.
<LINE,24>Hmm... The way you choose POKéMON\ntells me that you are still showing\nsome mercy toward your opponent.\nThat's not beautiful!
<LINE,24>I don't think you know the distinction between real\nstatus problems and conditions that only appear similar.
<LINE,24>Performance-affecting conditions\nthat aren't real status problems\ncan be doubled up on a POKéMON.\nDid you know that?
<LINE,24>I shall lead with <COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>MURKROW<COL1,POP>, then follow with GHOST\nPOKéMON. How will you vanquish such a diabolical team?
<LINE,24>Combining items and moves... I see. I shall have EARL\ninstruct me.
<LINE,24>I shall use the same lineup--<COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>MURKROW<COL1,POP> followed by\nGHOST-type POKéMON.
<LINE,24>Using combinations of items and moves... My, that's\nwicked.
<LINE,24>An excellent demonstration of how\nto use items! You showed me a\nsplendid shutout win!
<LINE,24>You attained a grand victory using\nonly certain POKéMON and items.\nBeautiful!  
<LINE,24>That wasn't my best performance. May I battle you again?\n
<LINE,24>Hmm... Not too beautiful. When\nchoosing your battlers, take note\nof the items they are holding.
<LINE,24>You couldn't win even after I told you my lineup...? That\nis amazing in its own way...
<LINE,24>When choosing your POKéMON, pay\nattention to the items they are\nholding.
<LINE,24>I have dual-type POKéMON. Think you can pick on the\nweaknesses?
<LINE,24>I'm going to study every day so I won't lose to you!
<LINE,24>Last time was some kind of mistake! Let's see you hit the\nweak spots!
<LINE,24>Oh... When there are two types, you end up with more weak\npoints...
<LINE,24>A perfect victory by maximally\nexploiting type match-up\nadvantages! This is too beautiful!
<LINE,24>You earned that win by maximally\nexploiting type match-up\nadvantages. Beautiful!
<LINE,24>What do you mean by that? If we battled again, I'd win\nfor sure! Grrr...
<LINE,24>Hmm... Not too beautiful. Perhaps\nyou should choose POKéMON that\ncan exploit the weaknesses of both\nof a dual-type POKéMON's types.
<LINE,24>(...giggle...) Unless you pick at my weak spots, there's no\nchance of me losing.
<LINE,24>If you hit both of the weak\naspects of a dual-type POKéMON,\nyou'll inflict quadruple the damage.
<LINE,24>I use only <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>FLY<COL1,POP> and <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>DIG<COL1,POP>! I won't use anything else. Can you\novercome them?
<LINE,24>Wow, there are moves that work on a POKéMON that's\nusing <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>FLY<COL1,POP> or <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>DIG<COL1,POP>! ...Whew! DUSTIN got a good lesson here!
<LINE,24>I stand by my decision to use <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>FLY<COL1,POP> and <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>DIG<COL1,POP>. Come on, let's\nbattle again!
<LINE,24>Moves that hit while I'm using <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>FLY<COL1,POP> and <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>DIG<COL1,POP>... I never\nknew! No one ever told me about them!
<LINE,24>You used your opponent's moves\nand strategy against them to get\nthat perfect win! Beautiful!
<LINE,24>You used your opponent's moves\nand strategy to earn the win!\nBeautiful!
<LINE,24>Argh! No! But if we battle again, I'm confident that I'll\nwin.
<LINE,24>Not too beautiful! Consider\nchoosing POKéMON with moves that\ncan strike an opponent that's\nusing <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>FLY<COL1,POP> or <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>DIG<COL1,POP>.
<LINE,24>How do you like the power of <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>FLY<COL1,POP> and <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>DIG<COL1,POP>? As long as I\nhave them, I can't lose!
<LINE,24>You should investigate moves that\ncan strike POKéMON that are using\n<COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>FLY<COL1,POP> or <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>DIG<COL1,POP>.
<LINE,24>Not only do my POKéMON have high SPCL.DEF stats, but\nthey also know <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>LIGHT SCREEN<COL1,POP>.
<LINE,24>Ack... My party was much too weak against physical\nattacks... It's a total wipeout.
<LINE,24>My POKéMON have high SPCL.DEF stats, and they know how\nto use <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>LIGHT SCREEN<COL1,POP>. Come on. Battle me again!
<LINE,24><COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>PSYCHIC<COL1,POP>-type POKéMON using physical attacks? I\nhaven't learned formulas like that yet...
<LINE,24>Using physical attacks when your\nopponent didn't expect them! That\nwas a beautiful, perfect win!
<LINE,24>Sometimes it can be more effective\nfor <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>PSYCHIC<COL1,POP>-type POKéMON to use\nphysical attacks. Expertly done!
<LINE,24>This isn't what I was taught! If we battle again, I'll win!
<LINE,24>Hmm... Your choices of POKéMON are\nstill somewhat lax. Not too\nbeautiful.
<LINE,24>Ha, ha, ha! Didn't I tell you? My POKéMON's SPCL.DEF\nstats are perfect!
<LINE,24>If the opponent has high SPCL.DEF\nstats, using physical attacks is\none possible approach.
<LINE,24>I rely solely on <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>HYPER BEAM<COL1,POP>! Only the toughest POKéMON\nwill be able to withstand it.
<LINE,24>...That was a wash-out. I'll have to watch for a <COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>PIKACHU<COL1,POP>\nholding a <COL1,PUSH,180,255,134,255>LIGHT BALL<COL1,POP> and a <COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>CUBONE<COL1,POP> holding a <COL1,PUSH,180,255,134,255>THICK CLUB<COL1,POP>.
With my <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>HYPER BEAM<COL1,POP>, I'm ready for more! Only the\ntoughest POKéMON will be able to withstand it.
A <COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>PIKACHU<COL1,POP> holding a <COL1,PUSH,180,255,134,255>LIGHT BALL<COL1,POP> and a <COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>CUBONE<COL1,POP> holding a\n<COL1,PUSH,180,255,134,255>THICK CLUB<COL1,POP>... Well thought. I lost completely.
<LINE,24>You earned a magnificently perfect\nwin by using every factor to your\nadvantage. It's too amazing!
<LINE,24>You used a variety of factors to\nyour advantage. You clearly\nunderstand how items work!
<LINE,24>Darn it! I lost by sheer coincidence, but it won't be this\nway next time. I challenge you to another battle!
<LINE,24>Hmm... Not too beautiful. You need\nto be a little more clever when\nchoosing your POKéMON.
<LINE,24>After using <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>HYPER BEAM<COL1,POP>, POKéMON get tired and have to\nrest. That leaves them vulnerable.
<LINE,24>If a tough POKéMON is hit with\n<COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>HYPER BEAM<COL1,POP>, you can switch out\nwhile the opponent is recharging.
<LINE,24>First I raise my ATTACK stat, then I use <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>HYPER BEAM<COL1,POP>.\nCan your POKéMON safely weather such a blast?
<LINE,24>I was going to beat <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>REVERSAL<COL1,POP> using speedy POKéMON... I\nhate to admit it, but you win.
<LINE,24>I'm going to raise my ATTACK stat, then let loose a\n<COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>HYPER BEAM<COL1,POP>. Can you stay safe this time?
<LINE,24>An <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>ENDURE<COL1,POP> and <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>REVERSAL<COL1,POP> combo...? Could you teach me\nhow to do that?
<LINE,24>You know exactly how moves work.\nThat was a beautiful shutout!
<LINE,24>Your POKéMON choices were right\non the money. You earned that\nbeautiful win by boosting your\nSPEED.
<LINE,24>I lost... but I'm going to win next time! You should be more\ncareful when choosing your POKéMON.
<LINE,24>Not too beautiful! Be very careful\nwhen choosing POKéMON. Try to\ncreate a team in which every\nmember has a chance of winning.
<LINE,24>So slow! Your POKéMON are way too slow. They make\nfantastic targets!
<LINE,24>Watch for the instant when your\nopponent uses <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>HYPER BEAM<COL1,POP>. That's\nwhen you should use <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>ENDURE<COL1,POP>.
<LINE,24>Show me some beautiful combos. <COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>DRAGONITE<COL1,POP>! <COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>TYRANITAR<COL1,POP>!\nAssist us in this demonstration!
<LINE,24>Whew... There's no beating that. I'm awed by your superb\ncombo performance!
<LINE,24>Let me see your combos again. <COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>DRAGONITE<COL1,POP>! <COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>TYRANITAR<COL1,POP>!\nGo!
<LINE,24>I never knew such an inspired combo existed... I've got to\nkeep polishing my act.
<LINE,24>You obviously know your combos.\nYour perfect victory was almost\nas beautiful as I am!
<LINE,24>You made excellent use of combos.\nYou are quite a beautiful student!
<LINE,24>Wha... I... I lost? Tch... I won't take you for granted\nnext time! Prepare to lose!
<LINE,24>Hmm... Not too beautiful. Perhaps\nyou ought to choose only those\nPOKéMON that possess effective\ncombos?
<LINE,24>If you want to measure up to my act, come at me with\nsome beautiful combos!
<LINE,24>Try to hit each of your opponent's\nPOKéMON with combos that are\neffective against them\nspecifically.
<LINE,24>I'm feeling sort of blue. I'll show you my <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>RAIN DANCE<COL1,POP> and\n<COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>THUNDER<COL1,POP> combo.
<LINE,24>Controlling the weather is a clever way to give yourself\nthe advantage in battle.
<LINE,24>I'm going to be serious this time... I'll demonstrate the\npower of the <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>RAIN DANCE<COL1,POP> and <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>THUNDER<COL1,POP> combo!
<LINE,24>A team that becomes stronger with <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>RAIN DANCE<COL1,POP> is very\nweak against <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>SUNNY DAY<COL1,POP>... You're so mean!
<LINE,24>It's clear you understand combos\nthat rely on the weather. A\nbeautifully executed perfect\nvictory!
<LINE,24>Your POKéMON choices were\nprecisely correct. You clearly\nunderstand the relationship bet-\nween weather and certain moves.
<LINE,24>I've been attending this academy for a long time. I won't\nlose! Battle me once more!
<LINE,24>Hmm... Not too beautiful. I have a\nfeeling that the way you chose\nyour POKéMON was a bit careless.
<LINE,24>Haven't you been paying any attention to EARL's lessons?\nWhat a waste.
<LINE,24>Use <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>SUNNY DAY<COL1,POP> against the\nopponent's <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>RAIN DANCE<COL1,POP>. Use <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>STOMP<COL1,POP>\nfor <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>MINIMIZE<COL1,POP>.

I can only keep getting better! Losing is\nnot an option!
Experience the true ferocity of the\nELITE FOUR.
Hm? I see no fear in you. You look\ndetermined.
Hoo hah!
Having lost, I have no right to say\nanything... Go face your next challenge!
Just try to entertain me.
Strong POKéMON. Weak POKéMON. Those are\nonly the selfish perceptions of people.
I live in shadows--a ninja!
POKéMON is not merely about brute force...\nYou shall see soon enough!
I must hone my skills.
As a trainer, I will use my full power\nagainst any other trainer!
I lost? I don't believe it. There must be\nsome mistake...
From now on, I'm going to train\n24 hours a day!
...Thank you for your help at the\nLIGHTHOUSE...
...You are a better trainer than me, in\nboth skill and kindness.
Um... I don't know how to say this,\nbut good luck...
I have been with POKéMON\nsince before you were born.
With your strong will, I know you will\novercome all of life's obstacles.
I believed that tale, so I have secretly\ntrained here all my life.
As a result, I can now see\nwhat others cannot.
I could see a future in which I meet the\nlegendary POKéMON.
Everyone was into POKéMON, so I got\ninto it, too! POKéMON are super-cute!
You want to battle? I'm warning\nyou--I'm good!
Ah, that was a good cry! Come back\nand visit again! Bye-bye!
I'll show you the real power of the\nmagnificent bird POKéMON!
My Dad's cherished bird POKéMON...
I'm going to train harder to become the\ngreatest bird master ever!
But if nature so much as twitches,\nwe can lose in a second.
I'm still a trainer. If I see a strong\nopponent, it makes me want to battle.
If you want to battle me, come to the\nVIRIDIAN GYM.
I wasn't in the mood at CINNABAR, but now\nI'm ready to battle you.
You're telling me you conquered all the\nGYMs in JOHTO? Heh! JOHTO's GYMs\nmust be pretty pathetic then.
Hey, don't worry about it. I'll see if you\nare good or not by battling you right now.
You're the real deal.\nYou are a good trainer.
But I'm going to beat you someday. Don't\nyou forget it!
My GYM in CINNABAR burned down.
When I rebuild my CINNABAR GYM,\nwe'll have to have a rematch.
Three years ago I had a vision of\nyour arrival.
Since you wish it, I will show you my\npsychic powers!
I don't enjoy battling, but it's my duty as\na LEADER to confer BADGES on anyone\nwho has proven him- or herself worthy.
Your power... It far exceeds what I\nforesaw... Maybe it isn't possible to fully\npredict what the future holds...
You will become a celebrated and beloved\nCHAMPION!
The power of love, I think, is also\na kind of psychic power...
Hee, hee... I'm sorry to disappoint you...\nI'm only joking! I'm the real one.
I'm going to really apply myself and\nimprove my skills.
Hello... Lovely weather,\nisn't it?
Very well,but I shall not lose.
Hey, little boy!\nI have to hand it to you.
When it comes to electric POKéMON,\nI'm number one!
Hey, boy! Still slugging and chugging away?\nMy POKéMON and I are still at it!
Come to CERULEAN GYM.\nI'll be happy to take you on.

I want #70. I'll be here\ntomorrow. Please come again.
Today is a very happy day.
That's so nice. I don't have that.
Wow! #70 amazed me.\nI want that, too.
You show up on #79 every week.
It has been a week. How have you been?
You used to come every day. Were you busy?

What? #26 is evolving!
Huh? #26 stopped evolving!
Congratulations! Your #26\nevolved into #34!
#32 was sent to #21.
#26 learned #65!
#26 is trying to learn\n#65.
But #26 can't learn more than\nfour moves.
Delete an older move to make room for\n#65?
#26 did not learn #65.
Stop learning #65?
If #65 is learned, this POKéMON\ncannot be moved to <TEX,1>.\nIs that OK?
Which move should\nbe forgotten?
OK?

Congratulations! You beat the champ!\nHere's a special present for you!
A previously forgotten TM can be\nlearned once again. Here's your\nchance!
One of your party POKéMON can now\nrelearn a TM.
Yes
No
Select POKéMON
Select TM to learn
Which move should be forgotten\ninstead of #65?
#66 will be forgotten and\n#65 will be learned. OK?
Don't let your POKéMON learn the TM?
#25 can learn these TMs.
#25 wants to\nforget #65.
1, 2 and...
1, 2 and...Poof!
#25 forgot how to\nuse #65!
And...
#25 learned \n#66!
Thank you very much for\ncoming.
Is it OK to learn #65?
There are no moves to relearn.
This is an important Move. You can't\nmake your POKéMON forget it.
Your POKéMON can't learn Moves while\nchallenging the Battle Tower in the \nCrystal version.
Rental POKéMON can't learn TMs.

<FACE,20,2>Hey! Let's battle!
<FACE,20,2>Ready? Go, #26!
<FACE,20,2>#26, I'm counting on you!
<FACE,20,2>#26!
<FACE,20,2>You can do it! Go, #26!
<FACE,20,1>Here's your chance, #26!
<FACE,20,0>Oh, no! Come back!
<FACE,20,2>#26, come back!
<FACE,20,2>Good going, #26! Come back!
<FACE,20,1>Way to go, #26!
<FACE,20,0>Argh! Bummer, man!
<FACE,20,2>Take that!
<FACE,20,1>You hit the weak spot! Good, #26!
<FACE,20,0>Argh! Hit it where it hurts!
<FACE,20,0>Oh, no!
<FACE,20,1>There! Yes!
<FACE,20,0>Ooh. That hurt...
<FACE,20,1>Okay!
<FACE,20,0>Argh! This can't be happening!
<FACE,20,2>You're really supposed to use your own\nPOKéMON.
<FACE,20,2>It's no good if you can't use any kind of\nPOKéMON.
<FACE,20,2>Isn't it boring to win using tough POKéMON?
<FACE,20,2>Are you trying to become a POKéMON MASTER?
<FACE,20,1>Yes! I win! What's the matter with you?
<FACE,20,2>Work on your skills at the STADIUM, then come back and see me.
<FACE,20,2>You can get lessons on battle techniques.
<FACE,20,1>You did it! Now you can aim for the CHAMPIONSHIP.
<FACE,20,1>You're pretty tough. Keep sluggin' away!
<FACE,20,1>There are many trainers at the STADIUM who are much stronger.
<FACE,20,2>You won't get anywhere if you can only tie me.
<FACE,20,2>What? You're giving up? Hmph...

<FACE,58,1><KONRAN,2>That's clever, #26!
<FACE,58,1>Fantastic! Bird POKéMON are the greatest!
<FACE,58,2>Maybe you should retrain your POKéMON.
<FACE,58,1>Your POKéMON aren't bad at all.
<FACE,58,2>I'm still going to continue living with these guys.
<FACE,58,2>FALKNER is a lot tougher than I am.
<FACE,58,2>Hmm. You raised your POKéMON better than I did mine.
<FACE,58,1>That was a good match. Would you like to battle again?
<FACE,58,2>That's disappointing. I thought we could have a good battle.

<FACE,18,2>I'm FALKNER! I'm going to be the toughest bird master ever!
<FACE,18,2>I can't let you get past me. The honor of bird trainers\neverywhere is at stake! 
<FACE,18,2>Sorry, but there's no way I'll lose to your POKéMON!
<FACE,18,2>All right! Get going, #26!
<FACE,18,2>This time, it's #26.
<FACE,18,2>Shall we toy with them, #26?
<FACE,18,2>#26! It's your show!
<FACE,18,2>Playtime is over, #26!
<FACE,18,0>Tch! Come back, #26!
<FACE,18,1>Okay, switch out, #26!
<FACE,18,1>That's enough, #26! Come back!
<FACE,18,1>Good job! Come back!
<FACE,18,0>What!? Shoot!
<FACE,18,2>Outstanding!
<FACE,18,2>Hit the weak spot! That's right!
<FACE,18,0>Ooh, critical hit! Not bad!
<FACE,18,0>Argh. That was bad!
<FACE,18,2>Gotcha!
<FACE,18,0>Argh!
<FACE,18,2>How's that!?
<FACE,18,0>Aack! #26!
<FACE,18,1>There are many kinds of bird POKéMON.
<FACE,18,1>Lots of trainers are passionate about bird\nPOKéMON.
<FACE,18,1><WAZA,189,2>#26! MUD-SLAP!
<FACE,18,1>Do you like bird POKéMON, too?
<FACE,18,2>Whew! That was a good battle.
<FACE,18,2>You did pretty well, too.
<FACE,18,2>Bird POKéMON are the best after all!
<FACE,18,0>What'll you do if my POKéMON's wings get damaged?!?
<FACE,18,0>...Shoot! Yeah, I lost.
<FACE,18,1>Can't I win using only FLYING-type POKéMON?
<FACE,18,1>I guess these things happen.
<FACE,18,1>Ha, ha, ha! So, you're just going to turn tail and run?

<FACE,39,2>Heh, heh. You might want to rethink your opinion of these guys.
<FACE,39,2>I'll bet you don't know how great bug POKéMON are.
<FACE,39,2>Here I come!
<FACE,39,2>There, #26!
<FACE,39,2>I'm counting on you, #26!
<FACE,39,1>This is it, #26!

<FACE,39,0>Aww! You goof! That was your weak spot!
<FACE,39,0>Oh, rats!
<FACE,39,2>That was plain unlucky.
<FACE,39,2>#26!
<FACE,39,1>#26! You did it!
<FACE,39,0>#26!
<FACE,39,1><HIRUMI,2>Yes! What a chance!
<FACE,39,1><MAHI,1>So, #26 is pretty good, huh?
<FACE,39,2>I had a hard time catching this guy.
<FACE,39,2>You don't think bug POKéMON are gross,\ndo you?
<FACE,39,1>I did it! See? Didn't I tell you they were tough?
<FACE,39,2>I'd better take them home and let them rest... What? You want to\nbattle again?
<FACE,39,2>I think you should study a bit more.
<FACE,39,2>Hmm. I need to train them better...
<FACE,39,2>Let's have another battle sometime.
<FACE,39,2>I didn't expect this to happen...
<FACE,39,2>A draw, huh? You're pretty good.
<FACE,39,2>Why are you giving up? Let's finish this.

<FACE,5,0>Greetings. How good of you to come. Shall we get started?
<FACE,5,0>First, calm your emotions and concentrate.
<FACE,5,0>I consider this battle to be part of my training.
<FACE,5,0>#26!
<FACE,5,0>How about #26?
<FACE,5,0>I will go with #26!
<FACE,5,0>I share your pain, but this, too, is a trial!\n#26!
<FACE,5,0>The finish is important! #26!
<FACE,5,0>I shall switch out.
<FACE,5,0>I shall switch out.
<FACE,5,0>I shall switch out.
<FACE,5,0>I shall switch out.
<FACE,5,0>Ah! How impressive!

<FACE,5,0>Ah, well, well... It got the weak spot.
<FACE,5,0>My goodness! It hit the weak spot.
<FACE,5,0>There is nothing to fear.
<FACE,5,0>There is nothing to fear.
<FACE,5,0>One must endure...
<FACE,5,0>And now it will rest.
<FACE,5,0>Oh, my...
<FACE,5,0><KONRAN,2>One mustn't be misled...
<FACE,5,0><WAZA,212,2>A MEAN LOOK will do.
<FACE,5,0><KOHRI,2>The bitter cold is yet another test.
<FACE,5,0><NOROI,2>It appears to be possessed.
<FACE,5,0>I am grateful for this.
<FACE,5,0>I still need much training.
<FACE,5,0>You should return later.
<FACE,5,0>I am grateful for this.
<FACE,5,0>My training is insufficient.
<FACE,5,0>I must meditate over this.
<FACE,5,0>Ah, your efforts are inspiring.
<FACE,5,0>I believe that withdrawal is a form of etiquette.

<FACE,36,0>How unfortunate. But it's not enough.
<FACE,36,0>In addition to strengthening your POKéMON's moves, you must\nalso strengthen your own soul.
<FACE,36,0>If the trainer isn't focused, his POKéMON can't concentrate,\neither.
<FACE,36,0>That's good. The POKéMON look happy, too.
<FACE,36,0>I lost. I will have to increase my training.
<FACE,36,0>That's how to do it. I look forward to seeing you become even\nstronger.

<FACE,9,2>It's all over, #26!
<FACE,9,0>Aack! I misplayed that!
<FACE,9,1>Bingo! Exactly as planned!
<FACE,9,1>Yes! That hit the weak spot! Just as I\nplanned it!
<FACE,9,2>Critical hit? That one couldn't be helped.
<FACE,9,0>Oh! That's a little annoying!
<FACE,9,2>So... We do this now and...
<FACE,9,0>Awww, that's so tedious.
<FACE,9,1>And that's the game! Ha, ha, ha...
<FACE,9,0>Oh... How could this happen...?
<FACE,9,2>There are many kinds of trainers out there,\ndon't you think?
<FACE,9,2>Some people prefer raising POKéMON to\nbattling.
<FACE,9,1><NEMURI,4>Hush. Be good, and stay asleep.
<FACE,9,1><DOKU,2>Isn't that gooey feeling horrible?
<FACE,9,1>I did it! I am so great!
<FACE,9,1>Thank you. I didn't learn much from this, though.
<FACE,9,2>Your power? Eh, I'd say it's all right. For what it is...
<FACE,9,0>I'm furious! I can't help myself--losing steams me!
<FACE,9,0>I lost because of that one move. That has to be it.
<FACE,9,0>I've never been beaten this way.
<FACE,9,0>Arrrgh! So close! If only that had worked...
<FACE,9,2>Bye-bye!

<FACE,10,2>Come face my thoroughly toughened POKéMON!
<FACE,10,2>I can see that you're a skilled trainer. Let's give it a go!
<FACE,10,2>Go a round with me before you shoot for the top!
<FACE,10,2>Go, #26!
<FACE,10,2>#26, get out there!
<FACE,10,2>I'm counting on you, #26!
<FACE,10,2>#26, it's you!
<FACE,10,2>#26, what a chance!
<FACE,10,2>Come back, #26!
<FACE,10,2>Enough, #26!
<FACE,10,1>Way to work, #26!
<FACE,10,1>I tip my hat to you, #26!
<FACE,10,0>Whoa! That was powerful!
<FACE,10,1>Whew, that was electrifying!
<FACE,10,1>Yeah! Popped it where it hurts the most!\nThat's the idea!
<FACE,10,0>Yikes! Took it where it hurts! 
<FACE,10,0>Whoa, no!
<FACE,10,1>Looking good.
<FACE,10,0>Uh-oh... Hang tough!
<FACE,10,1>And there we have it. Thanks so much!
<FACE,10,0>Ack... My #26...
<FACE,10,1><YAKEDO,2>Heh, sorry about that.
<FACE,10,2>Your POKéMON are well trained.
<FACE,10,2>Your POKéMON have been raised meticulously.
<FACE,10,1><MEROMERO,2>Quite elegant, wouldn't you say?
<FACE,10,1>Thanks! I'm sure you'll get tougher, too.
<FACE,10,2>Well, I'd better go look for my next opponent.
<FACE,10,2>You know, you're not necessarily a bad trainer.
<FACE,10,0>I surrender! I was totally defeated!
<FACE,10,2>I'm sorry. I took you for granted, but you are tough after all.
<FACE,10,2>I suppose there must be many tough trainers.
<FACE,10,2>Whew... We must be evenly matched.
<FACE,10,2>Okay. See you some other time.

<FACE,21,0>I am CLAIR, the dragon user. You're challenging me?
<FACE,21,0>So, you're aiming for the top? Well, we'll just see about that.

<FACE,21,0>Hmm... Well done.
<FACE,21,0>Forgive me.
<FACE,21,0>Forgive me. It happened to hit the weak\nspot.
<FACE,21,0>So you got a critical hit. Is that the best\nyou can do?
<FACE,21,0>That's about it.
<FACE,21,0>Forgive me.
<FACE,21,0>...
<FACE,21,0>That's that.
<FACE,21,0>It's all over...
<FACE,21,0><MAHI,2>That should do.
<FACE,21,0><KOHRI,2>The outcome is clear now.
<FACE,21,0>I'm trying to learn all there is to know about\ndragons.
<FACE,21,0>Could there be a stronger type than the\ndragon type?
<FACE,21,0>You disappoint me. It's futile for you to try for the top at your\nskill level.
<FACE,21,0>I'm having a hard time understanding how you could have come\nthis far.
<FACE,21,0>I would say you're ten years too early to be challenging the\nELITE FOUR.
<FACE,21,0>I'm amazed... I never expected anyone to beat me...
<FACE,21,0>You're skilled enough to hold your own against the ELITE FOUR.
<FACE,21,0>I wonder how far you can go at your skill level. This should be\nfascinating.
<FACE,21,0>If you stall here, can you imagine what it would be like ahead?
<FACE,21,0>Good. That's an intelligent decision.

<FACE,23,0>So, you have finally reached me. All right. Prepare for battle!
<FACE,23,0>Have you studied up on PSYCHIC-type POKéMON?
<FACE,23,0>I have observed your battle techniques. I'm ready for you!
<FACE,23,0>Start!
<FACE,23,0>Switch to #26!
<FACE,23,0>#26, go!
<FACE,23,0>#26, fight!
<FACE,23,0>Attack, #26!
<FACE,23,0>Come back, #26!
<FACE,23,0>#26, that will do!
<FACE,23,0>That was good!
<FACE,23,0>You earned a reward!
<FACE,23,0>Hmm... Not bad.
<FACE,23,0>Did that surprise you?
<FACE,23,0>We're taking aim at its weak spot. How do you\nlike that?
<FACE,23,0>I felt that. That connected with a weak\nspot.
<FACE,23,0>Oh... This is vexing.
<FACE,23,0>Now what are your options?
<FACE,23,0>Hmm... This can't be helped.
<FACE,23,0>That decided it.
<FACE,23,0>I blew it all!
<FACE,23,0>You lived up to the rumors.
<FACE,23,0>You may be good enough to join the\nELITE FOUR.
<FACE,23,0><WAZA,094,4>Here's an attack on the psyche!
<FACE,23,0><MAHI,2>You really are unlucky.
<FACE,23,0>That was close. I wonder what it is that you lack.
<FACE,23,0>Sorry about that, but I'm shooting for the top myself.
<FACE,23,0>I never thought you could come this far.
<FACE,23,0>I'm impressed. I have no regrets about this. Go on ahead.
<FACE,23,0>Of all the opponents I've faced, you're the best without a doubt.
<FACE,23,0>I've expended all my power. I have no regrets about losing\nthis way.
<FACE,23,0>This battle will go down in history. I'm sure of it...
<FACE,23,0>You're quitting? After all you've done to get here?

<FACE,32,2>Ah, so it is you who defeated WILL? Interesting...
<FACE,32,2>Your arrival is indeed impressive, as is your look of resolve.
<FACE,32,2>Would you care for a glimpse into the world of the ninja?
<FACE,32,2>#26! How's that?
<FACE,32,2>#26 will take you on.
<FACE,32,2>There, #26!
<FACE,32,2>It can't be easy with #28.
<FACE,32,2>I pity you, but here's #26!
<FACE,32,0>This can't be helped!
<FACE,32,2>Enough!
<FACE,32,1>Well done, #26!
<FACE,32,1>#26, you make me proud!
<FACE,32,2>Ah... You've done well.
<FACE,32,1>Wah, ha, ha!
<FACE,32,2>That critical hit was by mere chance! It was\nnothing!
<FACE,32,2>Landing a critical hit is merely a fluke,\nthat's all!
<FACE,32,0>How impudent!
<FACE,32,2>How do you like that?
<FACE,32,2>So? What good is this?
<FACE,32,1>You have lost.
<FACE,32,0>This cannot be!
<FACE,32,2><WAZA,104,4>The ninja technique of DOUBLE TEAM!
<FACE,32,1><WAZA,092,2>Savor it! TOXIC!
<FACE,32,2>The human soul is but weak.
<FACE,32,2>Even you must fear the dark.
<FACE,32,2>You lack disciplined training!
<FACE,32,2>Have you learned to fear the techniques of the ninja?
<FACE,32,2>You expect to battle the ELITE FOUR with your current skills?
<FACE,32,2>Never have I met the likes of you.
<FACE,32,2>It stands to reason that you defeated WILL!
<FACE,32,2>I, too, must pursue further discipline.
<FACE,32,2>Hmm... You don't appear to be a raw amateur after all.
<FACE,32,2>It would be better for you to try at another time.

<FACE,53,1>I'm BRUNO. As one of the ELITE FOUR, I will stand up to your\nchallenge!
<FACE,53,1>You appear to be quite skilled, but this is your last stop!
<FACE,53,1>It would disturb me for you to underestimate my fighting\nPOKéMON. Get ready!
<FACE,53,1>Hah!
<FACE,53,1>How's that!?!
<FACE,53,1>Here it comes!

<FACE,53,0>Why!?! This just can't be happening!
<FACE,53,0>The world is huge! I must redo my training!
<FACE,53,1>Your next adversary, KAREN, has a battle style that is entirely\nunlike mine. Now what will you do?

<FACE,29,0>I am KAREN. Would you care for a showdown with my DARK-type\nPOKéMON?
<FACE,29,0>You've assembled a charming team. Our battle should be a\ngood one.
<FACE,29,0>I am unlike the three you've already met.
<FACE,29,0>There!
<FACE,29,0>#26, go!
<FACE,29,0>#26, please!
<FACE,29,0>#26, don't fail me!
<FACE,29,0>#26, you know what to do!
<FACE,29,0>You're no good for this!
<FACE,29,0>Switch out!
<FACE,29,0>That should be enough!
<FACE,29,0>Good, that's enough!
<FACE,29,0>Hmm... Is that how you want to play it?
<FACE,29,0>It's a lot less complicated this way.
<FACE,29,0>We weren't deliberately aiming for the weak\nspot.
<FACE,29,0>It hit the weak spot precisely. You're good.
<FACE,29,0>That was a smart move.
<FACE,29,0>That showed subtle elegance.
<FACE,29,0>Nothing can be done about that.
<FACE,29,0>It's working well.
<FACE,29,0>This can't be happening!
<FACE,29,0><KONRAN,2>So? Isn't it outstanding?
<FACE,29,0><MEROMERO,4>Oh, look. It's infatuated.
<FACE,29,0><MAHI,2>I was hoping for that.
<FACE,29,0>Wouldn't you agree that DARK-type POKéMON\nhave their charms?
<FACE,29,0>That's about what I expected.
<FACE,29,0>Well, that was relatively entertaining.
<FACE,29,0>Come visit me anytime.
<FACE,29,0>The CHAMPION is looking forward to meeting you.
<FACE,29,0>No! I can't win. How did you become so strong?
<FACE,29,0>I will not stray from my chosen path.
<FACE,29,0>A draw...? But how...?
<FACE,29,0>You're going to reappraise matters, aren't you?

<FACE,61,2>I am still the CHAMPION. I won't hold anything back.
<FACE,61,2>I thought that you would be able to get this far. Let's get this\nstarted.
<FACE,61,2>I'll lead with #26!
<FACE,61,2>Fine, #26!

<FACE,61,2>Okay, #26!

<FACE,61,1>That's clever.
<FACE,61,0>Ugh... Um...
<FACE,61,1>Gotcha!
<FACE,61,0>It's all over!

<FACE,61,1><MAHI,2>Yes! We own this match now!
<FACE,61,2>That was close. Want to try again?
<FACE,61,2>I successfully defended my CHAMPIONSHIP.
<FACE,61,2>It's not that you are weak. Don't let it bother you.
<FACE,61,2>You got me. You are magnificent!
<FACE,61,2>This is the emergence of a new CHAMPION.
<FACE,61,2>I never expected another trainer to beat me... I'm surprised.
<FACE,61,2>That was an intense battle.

<FACE,1,0>Why? How could this happen?
<FACE,1,0>I can understand losing to Father, but losing to you?
<FACE,1,2>Aren't you something. Where did you train?

<FACE,56,0>#26! We're done!
<FACE,56,2>What do you think of rock POKéMON?
<FACE,56,2>Wouldn't you agree that defense is\nessential?
<FACE,56,1>Your POKéMON are good, too.
<FACE,56,1>It's been a while since I had a battle like this.
<FACE,56,2>Defense is crucial, after all.
<FACE,56,1>Yeah, that was quite fun.
<FACE,56,1>You're tough, too. And you've got the potential to get even\nbetter.
<FACE,56,2>How could anyone break through my rock-hard defense...
<FACE,56,2>I was done in... I didn't know about that style of battling...
<FACE,56,2>The world is huge! I'm glad to have met you.
<FACE,56,2>A draw? How is that possible?
<FACE,56,2>It's not like you to run.

<FACE,15,1>Yes! Critical hit! Ha, ha, ha! Lucky!
<FACE,15,0>Waaah! No luck there! Took it where it's weak!
<FACE,15,0>What? You can't be serious.
<FACE,15,1>Okay!
<FACE,15,0>Man, that's frustrating.
<FACE,15,1>That's mine!
<FACE,15,0>Wh-what? Wait a sec!
<FACE,15,2>So you're aiming for the top?
<FACE,15,2>There are plenty of tough trainers out\nthere.
<FACE,15,2>POKéMON isn't all about battles.
<FACE,15,2>It's really something that you made it this\nfar.
<FACE,15,2>Sorry to say it, but this is it for you.
<FACE,15,1>See? My power is what got me here.
<FACE,15,2>It all comes down to your sense of balance.
<FACE,15,0>Lost? I lost? No way!
<FACE,15,2>You really are tough. I have to hand it to you.

<FACE,50,2>...mutter...POKéMON and...entropy... Huh? Don't disturb me!
<FACE,50,2>Any battle can be won by applying logic. What? You want to test\nmy hypothesis?
<FACE,50,2>Huh? Battle? I don't want to. Can't I just refuse?
<FACE,50,2>I don't want to see any rough stuff.
<FACE,50,2>Don't do anything mean to #26.
<FACE,50,2>Be nice. I really adore #26.

<FACE,41,1>Yes, you sure are tough. Keep it up!
<FACE,41,1>Well, I'll be seeing you.

<FACE,34,1>I love this #26!
<FACE,34,1>Have you ever seen a #25 that\nlooked as sweet as this one?
<FACE,34,1>#26! Gorgeous, eh?
<FACE,34,1>Okay, come back.
<FACE,34,1>Are you tired? Come back.
<FACE,34,0>Good going. That's enough.
<FACE,34,0>You were awesome, #26!
<FACE,34,2>Waah! Waaah! Waaaah!

<FACE,34,0>Oooh! Fabulous!
<FACE,34,2>No! Please stop!
<FACE,34,0>I'm overjoyed!
<FACE,34,2>Aiyeeeeeee!
<FACE,34,1><WAZA,162,4>This will chop its HP in half! SUPER FANG!
<FACE,34,1><WAZA,7,4>Burn up! FIRE PUNCH!
<FACE,34,1><WAZA,72,4>Steal its HP! MEGA DRAIN!
<FACE,34,1><WAZA,95,4>Take that! Go to sleep!
<FACE,34,1>Hmm... That was inspiring. Such a neat victory.
<FACE,34,1>When it comes down to the wire, my POKéMON become even more\nwonderful.
<FACE,34,1>Ooh, that was so, like, subtle and deep. Don't you think it was a\nmemorable battle?
<FACE,34,2>Waaah! My POKéMON! You're so mean!
<FACE,34,2>Wh-what have you done...? I'm speechless...
<FACE,34,2>No... ...groan...

<FACE,50,2>Any battle can be won by applying logic. What? You want to test\nmy hypothesis?
<FACE,50,2>Huh? Battle? I don't want to. Can't I just refuse?
<FACE,50,2>I don't want to see any rough stuff.
<FACE,50,2>Don't do anything mean to #26.
<FACE,50,2>Be nice. I really adore #26.

<FACE,50,2>You can't win because you rely solely on instinct.
<FACE,50,2>I think that you need to study a whole lot more.
<FACE,50,0>Eeeek! How did my logic fail me?
<FACE,50,2>My logic wasn't faulty! There must still be a missing element.

<FACE,52,0>#26 will go.
<FACE,52,0>#26 is good.

<FACE,52,0>I'm changing POKéMON.
<FACE,52,0>Well then, I'll do it this way.
<FACE,52,0>Oh, my goodness. Your POKéMON are\ntremendous!
<FACE,52,0>Don't be crushed!
<FACE,52,0>It hit the weak spot. Think about what you\nshould do next.
<FACE,52,0>Hmm... Aim for the weak spot? Not too bad.
<FACE,52,0>Was that planned?
<FACE,52,0>Now, think about it.
<FACE,52,0>That's the way.
<FACE,52,0>Oh... How did it get this way?
<FACE,52,0>Oh... How terrible.
<FACE,52,0><WAZA,104,4>It's important to avoid being hit.
<FACE,52,0><WAZA,115,4>REFLECT is good against physical attacks.

<FACE,52,0><WAZA,097,4>Agility is very important.
<FACE,52,0>What did you do wrong? Your homework is to figure that out.
<FACE,52,0>I should have gone easier on you. Sorry!
<FACE,52,0>You have to try harder. I'll be cheering you on!
<FACE,52,0>You're really gifted! What school did you say you're from?
<FACE,52,0>Oh my. I lost. It wasn't on purpose, either.
<FACE,52,0>With your skill level, I can recommend you for national\ntournaments.
<FACE,52,0>That's too bad. You were so close, too.

<FACE,47,2>Sorry, kid, but I'm going to use you for practice.
<FACE,47,2>What's with you? Doesn't TEAM ROCKET terrify you?
<FACE,47,2>Are you ready to lose?
<FACE,47,2>Try this for a start!
<FACE,47,2>It's you!
<FACE,47,2>I'm depending on you!
<FACE,47,2>Rub it out!
<FACE,47,2>Put it out of its misery!
<FACE,47,2>You're no good for this!
<FACE,47,2>Switch out!
<FACE,47,2>That's enough, you!
<FACE,47,1>Yes! Good job!
<FACE,47,0>Kyaaah! You idiot!
<FACE,47,1>Excellent, #26!
<FACE,47,1>Got its weak spot! Good one, #26!
<FACE,47,0>You aimed for the weak spot! You battle\ndirty!
<FACE,47,0>Ack! That was so foul!
<FACE,47,1>Good going, #26!
<FACE,47,2>Do you have personality problems?
<FACE,47,1>Ha, ha... Sorry, kid.
<FACE,47,0>You're joking!
<FACE,47,1><HIRUMI,2>Ha, ha... Your POKéMON chickened out.
<FACE,47,2>You're not bad.
<FACE,47,2>I'm taking this seriously!
<FACE,47,2>Just you wait...
<FACE,47,1>Tsk, tsk, tsk... You could have battled harder...
<FACE,47,1>We don't need weaklings like you in TEAM ROCKET.
<FACE,47,1>I'm finished with you.
<FACE,47,0>No way! Bad news!
<FACE,47,2>You're tough. Come join TEAM ROCKET.
<FACE,47,2>Hmm... So there are kids like you...
<FACE,47,2>What's this all about?
<FACE,47,1>Ha, ha, ha... Run, little baby, run.

<FACE,24,1>Do you know the FIREBREATHER? We're kindred spirits.
<FACE,24,1>These balls contain VOLTORB. Juggling them is such a rush.
<FACE,24,1>Let's start, shall we?
<FACE,24,1>#26 shall do.
<FACE,24,1>Perhaps #26.
<FACE,24,1>#26, go!
<FACE,24,1>#26 shall put this to rest.
<FACE,24,1>I'll switch out.
<FACE,24,1>Another one will take its place.
<FACE,24,1>This one's done.
<FACE,24,1>...And now...
<FACE,24,0>Aaaah... How could this happen?
<FACE,24,1>That's right.
<FACE,24,0>Ooh, the weak spot. That worked perfectly.

<FACE,24,1>I can get by without any money.
<FACE,24,1>I wonder which country I should visit next?
<FACE,24,1>Were you taking that battle seriously? You must have\nunderestimated me.
<FACE,24,1>I'm pleased with how that turned out. I hope to build on my\nsuccess.
<FACE,24,0>I can't go home like this...
<FACE,24,0>If that's the way you want it, I'll SELFDESTRUCT with my\nVOLTORB!

<FACE,13,0>#26, get out there!
<FACE,13,0>Next, #26! Go!
<FACE,13,0>#26, try as hard as you can!
<FACE,13,0>#26, you can win!

<FACE,13,0>We raised our POKéMON together.
<FACE,13,0>We don't even lose to grownups.
<FACE,13,0>We'll keep trying. Yes, we will.
<FACE,13,0>We won. Good for us!
<FACE,13,0>JAN and JANE. We're strong!
<FACE,13,0>We won! That was really exciting.
<FACE,13,0>JAN and JANE, did we lose?
<FACE,13,0>Oh, we lost. We're so sad.
<FACE,13,0>That's a big no-no. You're strong.
<FACE,13,0>It's a tie. We're not happy about this.
<FACE,13,0>Do you give up? It is still JAN and JANE's win.

<FACE,60,2>Some fishermen have no patience at all! Hurry up, already!
<FACE,60,2>When I have a line in the water, I don't just stand there doing\nnothing.
<FACE,60,2>Have you ever gone fishing? Isn't it addictive?
<FACE,60,2>I'll start with #26.
<FACE,60,2>Let's try #26.
<FACE,60,2>Let's try #26.
<FACE,60,2>Let's try #26.
<FACE,60,2>Let's try #26.
<FACE,60,2>I'll change equipment.
<FACE,60,2>Let me change the fly.
<FACE,60,2>I'll try a different spot.
<FACE,60,2>How about some different bait?
<FACE,60,0>Aiyee!
<FACE,60,1>There! What a hit!
<FACE,60,1>Weak spot! There's the hit!
<FACE,60,0>Hi-yah! Critical hit, huh?
<FACE,60,0>Hey, hey...
<FACE,60,1>That's doing the trick.
<FACE,60,0>What'll I do?
<FACE,60,1>Yes, it's a big one!
<FACE,60,0>Waaaah! That's not right!
<FACE,60,1>I'd love to go fishing every day.
<FACE,60,1>Fishing is the ultimate hobby!
<FACE,60,1>The seas, the streams--both have their\ncharms.
<FACE,60,1>Fishing at night is fun, too.
<FACE,60,1>It feels great to win a battle!
<FACE,60,1>I feel like I've just landed a big one!
<FACE,60,1>If you use good equipment, your technique will improve.
<FACE,60,0>I feel as if a big one got away and took my rod with it...
<FACE,60,0>My preparation was all wrong. I'll fix that for next time!
<FACE,60,0>Battles are fun, but so is fishing. Join me sometime!
<FACE,60,2>A tie, huh? Well, that's fine, too. I don't worry about the little\nthings.
<FACE,60,2>What? You're leaving? I guess the tide has changed...

<FACE,25,2>I'm the best at school and in all my clubs. Do you still want to\nbattle?
<FACE,25,2>Which POKéMON is the most popular at your school?
<FACE,25,2>Here goes!
<FACE,25,2>It has to be #26!
<FACE,25,2>I learned that I should go with #26.
<FACE,25,2>#26 fits the formula!
<FACE,25,2>My teacher tells me #26!
<FACE,25,2>I'd better switch out.
<FACE,25,2>Gotta take this one out!
<FACE,25,2>In this situation...
<FACE,25,2>I'm pulling it back.
<FACE,25,0>Whaaat! That's ridiculous!
<FACE,25,1>Oh, yeah! Just like they taught me!
<FACE,25,1>Hitting the weak point? That was just lucky.
<FACE,25,0>Why! Why did it hit the weak spot?
<FACE,25,0>What are you supposed to do when this\nhappens?
<FACE,25,1>That certainly worked.
<FACE,25,0>Oh, there's nothing I can do.
<FACE,25,1>This is great! Battles are so much fun!
<FACE,25,0>Aiyee! Eeyaah!
<FACE,25,1>The kids in my class are tough, too.
<FACE,25,1>Some kids have lots of POKéMON.
<FACE,25,1>Everyone loves POKéMON.
<FACE,25,1>Actually, I think even my teacher likes\nPOKéMON.
<FACE,25,1>Ha, ha, ha... Give up?
<FACE,25,1>I did it! Now I'm cool!
<FACE,25,1>Yes! I'm gonna go brag to all my friends!
<FACE,25,0>Okay! I'm going to become strong like you!
<FACE,25,0>That's strange... I did exactly as I was taught...
<FACE,25,0>Waaah! I wonder what I should tell my friends.

<FACE,2,2>I'm going to challenge your POKéMON. It's obvious you're proud\nof them.
<FACE,2,2>You don't think I'm up to this, do you? You're going to regret\nthat.
<FACE,2,2>I'm going to finish this quickly, then go for a swim!
<FACE,2,2>How's this to start?
<FACE,2,2>Maybe #26?
<FACE,2,2>#26 might be it.
<FACE,2,2>I think I'll go with #26.
<FACE,2,2>#26 has to be it.
<FACE,2,2>I'm switching out!

<FACE,2,1>A direct hit on the weak spot. Ahhh... That\nfelt wonderful.
<FACE,2,0>Oh, no. Wait! I don't like you hitting the weak\nspot.
<FACE,2,0>What? What is that?
<FACE,2,2>That'll do.

<FACE,2,1>That's fantastic!
<FACE,2,0>Waaah! You meanie!
<FACE,2,2><MEROMERO,4>Ha, ha, ha... Stay that way for a while.
<FACE,2,2>There are many POKéMON in the sea.
<FACE,2,2>I want to see the seas of foreign countries.
<FACE,2,2>A sandy beach at night is wonderful.
<FACE,2,1>See? Aren't my POKéMON tough?
<FACE,2,1>It doesn't matter how you battle--a win is a win.
<FACE,2,1>Well, I'm going for a swim! Thanks for playing!
<FACE,2,0>It doesn't matter. No big deal. I still love these babies.
<FACE,2,2>You're really wild. I'm surprised!
<FACE,2,2>If I had known this would happen, I would have gone for a swim\ninstead.

<FACE,33,1>I'm elated!
<FACE,33,1>My, a critical hit. Please forgive me.
<FACE,33,0>Critical hit? No! How dare you!
<FACE,33,2>That was so unpleasant.

<FACE,17,2>It's time to test my research results! Sorry, but you will be my\ntest subject.
<FACE,17,2>I was cooped up in the lab. I needed a break, so here I am.
<FACE,17,2>You study POKéMON, too? Let's compare our abilities!
<FACE,17,2>#26, it is!
<FACE,17,2>It's my #26!
<FACE,17,2>It's this one in this situation!
<FACE,17,2>I'll go with #26.
<FACE,17,2>#26! Go get 'em!
<FACE,17,2>I'll have to switch out...
<FACE,17,2>I'm changing POKéMON.
<FACE,17,2>Change!
<FACE,17,2>Good, #26. Come back.
<FACE,17,0>What!?!
<FACE,17,1>Yes!
<FACE,17,1>Hit the weak spot! Outstanding!
<FACE,17,0>Oh, no! It took that on its weak spot!
<FACE,17,0>Hmm... How vexing!
<FACE,17,1>Good. That's good.
<FACE,17,0>Rats...
<FACE,17,1>Yeah! Eureka!
<FACE,17,0>What is this phenomenon?!?
<FACE,17,2>What am I studying? That's top secret!
<FACE,17,2>Why am I a rogue? Who knows?
<FACE,17,2>Lack of research funding is a major\nconcern.
<FACE,17,2>My research is sure to evoke controversy in\nsociety.
<FACE,17,1>Ha, ha, ha... My hypothesis was correct.
<FACE,17,1>Maybe this will persuade them to raise my research budget.
<FACE,17,1>Did you see the fruits of my research?
<FACE,17,0>Waaah! I sneaked out of the lab for this... The chief's going to\nchew me out again...
<FACE,17,2>What? Did I make an error? That's odd. I'll have to review my\nresearch notes.
<FACE,17,0>What a disaster! I can't present this to the Academy...
<FACE,17,2>I didn't lose, that's what matters. But, then again, I didn't win...

<FACE,14,0>POKéMON are popular in my country. How are they perceived here?
<FACE,14,0>On my travels, I often practice against SAILORs.
<FACE,14,0>Ah, you look determined. Would you care to join me in a battle?
<FACE,14,0>Perhaps I will start with #26.
<FACE,14,0>This one will do.
<FACE,14,0>I'll go with this one.
<FACE,14,0>Will this one do?
<FACE,14,0>This must be it.
<FACE,14,0>I must recover this one...
<FACE,14,0>So, if I switch out...
<FACE,14,0>Next...
<FACE,14,0>Given the present circumstances...
<FACE,14,0>Oh, my!
<FACE,14,0>Hmm...

<FACE,14,0>Oh, I see...
<FACE,14,0>Hmm...
<FACE,14,0>Is that so...

<FACE,14,0>Hmm...

<FACE,14,0>POKéMON are wonderful creatures.
<FACE,14,0>Battles make a person better.
<FACE,14,0>POKéMON make people more compassionate.
<FACE,14,0>Hmm... Good battle. You were outstanding.
<FACE,14,0>I forgot about my age and became serious. I owe it all to you.
<FACE,14,0>Thank you. I understand that there are magnificent trainers\neverywhere.
<FACE,14,0>Although I lost, I feel exhilarated. Thank you.
<FACE,14,0>I did the best I could, so I don't feel any resentment. You truly\nare strong.
<FACE,14,0>I feel fortunate to have met someone like you. Traveling is good\nfor me.
<FACE,14,0>Hmm... These things sometimes happen.
<FACE,14,0>I see... It can't be helped.

<FACE,6,1>The beach is nice, but the mountains are the\nbest.
<FACE,6,1>See? Aren't my POKéMON tough? 
<FACE,6,1>If you want tough POKéMON, you should go to the seas and\nmountains.
<FACE,6,1>I won! It was bound to happen, really. Your training was no match\nfor mine.
<FACE,6,0>How could this happen? I trained really, really hard.
<FACE,6,1>What? I lost? That's weird...
<FACE,6,1>Should I go look for stronger POKéMON?

<FACE,2,2>How's this to start?
<FACE,2,2>Maybe #26?
<FACE,2,2>#26 might be it.
<FACE,2,2>I think I'll go with #26.
<FACE,2,2>#26 has to be it.
<FACE,2,2>I'm switching out!
<FACE,2,2>Something else!
<FACE,2,2>That one's done!
<FACE,2,2>I'm pulling this one back!
<FACE,2,0>What? What was that all about?
<FACE,2,1>Oh, that was so refreshing!
<FACE,2,1>A direct hit on the weak spot. Ahhh... That\nfelt wonderful.
<FACE,2,0>Oh, no. Wait! I don't like you hitting the weak\nspot.
<FACE,2,0>What? What is that?
<FACE,2,2>That'll do.
<FACE,2,0>Is that how you do things?
<FACE,2,1>That's fantastic!
<FACE,2,0>Waaah! You meanie!
<FACE,2,2><MEROMERO,4>Ha, ha, ha... Stay that way for a while.
<FACE,2,2>There are many POKéMON in the sea.
<FACE,2,2>I want to see the seas of foreign countries.
<FACE,2,2>A sandy beach at night is wonderful.
<FACE,2,1>See? Aren't my POKéMON tough?
<FACE,2,1>It doesn't matter how you battle--a win is a win.
<FACE,2,1>Well, I'm going for a swim! Thanks for playing!
<FACE,2,0>It doesn't matter. No big deal. I still love these babies.
<FACE,2,2>You're really wild. I'm surprised!
<FACE,2,2>If I had known this would happen, I would have gone for a swim\ninstead.
<FACE,2,2>This turned out strangely.
<FACE,2,2>I see. So this is the end?

<FACE,43,0>Battles are perfectly legal, but POKéMON abuse is not.
<FACE,43,0>The streets have been quiet, so I've had time to thoroughly train\nmy squad.
<FACE,43,0>Can I count on your cooperation?
<FACE,43,0>It's #26!
<FACE,43,0>It's #26!
<FACE,43,0>It's #26!

<FACE,43,0>Oh, sorry!
<FACE,43,0>Oh, sorry! That bopped it on its weak spot.
<FACE,43,0>You hit its weak spot? Good one!
<FACE,43,0>Not too shabby.
<FACE,43,0>Whoops! Excuse me.
<FACE,43,0>I can't make a move.
<FACE,43,0>Yes! Case closed!

<FACE,43,0><KONRAN,4>Confusion is hard to take...
<FACE,43,0>You have some dandy POKéMON.
<FACE,43,0>On my off-duty days, I groom my POKéMON.
<FACE,43,0>Oh, sorry I beat you. Don't give up!
<FACE,43,0>You're pretty good yourself. You just need to apply yourself a\nlittle harder.
<FACE,43,0>That was like an open-and-shut case. Thanks for your\ncooperation!
<FACE,43,0>What's that? You've seen a BURGLAR around here?
<FACE,43,0>You're a tough one. Would you care to join the police force?
<FACE,43,0>Oops, my break is almost over. Thanks for your time.

<FACE,33,1>May I begin?
<FACE,33,1>Go on. Get out there.
<FACE,33,1>#26, you're my choice.
<FACE,33,1>#26, I'm depending on you.
<FACE,33,1>Your opponent is close to falling.
<FACE,33,1>No, I'm giving you the hook.
<FACE,33,1>Wait. Please wait.
<FACE,33,1>May I have a moment?
<FACE,33,1>I beg your pardon.
<FACE,33,2>Aiyee! You're a tough audience!
<FACE,33,1>I'm elated!
<FACE,33,1>My, a critical hit. Please forgive me.
<FACE,33,0>Critical hit? No! How dare you!
<FACE,33,2>That was so unpleasant.
<FACE,33,1>This could be my big break!
<FACE,33,0>You have to endure this!
<FACE,33,1>Oh! I'm so happy!
<FACE,33,2>That was a terrible performance!

<FACE,33,1>We all love POKéMON.
<FACE,33,1>POKéMON really are adorable, aren't they?
<FACE,33,1>We play with our POKéMON every day.
<FACE,33,1>Wouldn't you agree that I am quite good?
<FACE,33,1>Don't you think you should be a little more diligent and\ndetermined?
<FACE,33,1>I can finally beat someone. I'm delighted!
<FACE,33,2>What should I do? My mother will be disappointed.
<FACE,33,0>I don't like inflexible people like you! I don't want to know you!
<FACE,33,1>Please book us for a performance... How old did you say you were?

<FACE,17,2>#26, it is!
<FACE,17,2>It's my #26!
<FACE,17,2>It's this one in this situation!
<FACE,17,2>I'll go with #26.
<FACE,17,2>#26! Go get 'em!
<FACE,17,2>I'll have to switch out...
<FACE,17,2>I'm changing POKéMON.
<FACE,17,2>Change!
<FACE,17,2>Good, #26. Come back.
<FACE,17,0>What!?!
<FACE,17,1>Yes!
<FACE,17,1>Hit the weak spot! Outstanding!
<FACE,17,0>Oh, no! It took that on its weak spot!
<FACE,17,0>Hmm... How vexing!
<FACE,17,1>Good. That's good.
<FACE,17,0>Rats...
<FACE,17,1>Yeah! Eureka!
<FACE,17,0>What is this phenomenon?!?
<FACE,17,2>What am I studying? That's top secret!
<FACE,17,2>Why am I a rogue? Who knows?
<FACE,17,2>Lack of research funding is a major\nconcern.
<FACE,17,2>My research is sure to evoke controversy in\nsociety.
<FACE,17,1>Ha, ha, ha... My hypothesis was correct.
<FACE,17,1>Maybe this will persuade them to raise my research budget.
<FACE,17,1>Did you see the fruits of my research?
<FACE,17,0>Waaah! I sneaked out of the lab for this... The chief's going to\nchew me out again...
<FACE,17,2>What? Did I make an error? That's odd. I'll have to review my\nresearch notes.

<FACE,39,2>Here I come!
<FACE,39,2>There, #26!

<FACE,39,1>Ha, ha! That's it!
<FACE,39,1>Critical hit! Excellent, #26!
<FACE,39,0>Aww! You goof! That was your weak spot!
<FACE,39,0>Oh, rats!
<FACE,39,2>That was plain unlucky.
<FACE,39,2>#26!
<FACE,39,1>#26! You did it!
<FACE,39,0>#26!
<FACE,39,1><HIRUMI,2>Yes! What a chance!
<FACE,39,1><MAHI,1>So, #26 is pretty good, huh?
<FACE,39,2>I had a hard time catching this guy.
<FACE,39,2>You don't think bug POKéMON are gross,\ndo you?
<FACE,39,1>I did it! See? Didn't I tell you they were tough?
<FACE,39,2>I'd better take them home and let them rest... What? You want to\nbattle again?
<FACE,39,2>I think you should study a bit more.
<FACE,39,2>Hmm. I need to train them better...
<FACE,39,2>Let's have another battle sometime.
<FACE,39,2>I didn't expect this to happen...
<FACE,39,2>A draw, huh? You're pretty good.
<FACE,39,2>Why are you giving up? Let's finish this.

<FACE,5,0>I am grateful for this.
<FACE,5,0>My training is insufficient.

<FACE,36,0>In addition to strengthening your POKéMON's moves, you must\nalso strengthen your own soul.
<FACE,36,0>If the trainer isn't focused, his POKéMON can't concentrate,\neither.
<FACE,36,0>That's good. The POKéMON look happy, too.
<FACE,36,0>I lost. I will have to increase my training.
<FACE,36,0>That's how to do it. I look forward to seeing you become even\nstronger.

<FACE,46,0>You may have the qualities to become an EXECUTIVE.
<FACE,46,0>This does not mean that you have dashed our grand designs.

<FACE,55,2>My choice is #26!
<FACE,55,2>#26 ought to do it.
<FACE,55,2>Play it cool, #26.
<FACE,55,2>#26 might be the one.

<FACE,63,0>The anger of losing will spur you to work harder.
<FACE,63,0>Outstanding! That was perfect. Try not to forget what you\nfeel now.

<FACE,53,1>How's that!?!
<FACE,53,1>Here it comes!
<FACE,53,1>#26, make me proud!
<FACE,53,1>It's yours, #26!
<FACE,53,1>Blast it! Come back, #26!
<FACE,53,1>That's good! Come back!
<FACE,53,1>That's good enough!
<FACE,53,1>Good job!
<FACE,53,0>That can't be!
<FACE,53,1>There! #26!
<FACE,53,1>Critical hit! That's how you do it!
<FACE,53,0>Why! Why take that critical hit?
<FACE,53,1>That's not good!
<FACE,53,1>Good, #26!
<FACE,53,0>Arrrgh...
<FACE,53,1>There it is! That has to hurt!

<FACE,53,1>We are the most powerful trainers in the\nworld!

<FACE,53,1><KONRAN,2>Right! What an opportunity!
<FACE,53,1>Hoo hah!
<FACE,53,1>Now do you understand?!? That's the real power of the\nELITE FOUR!
<FACE,53,1>You can challenge me all you like, but the results will never\nchange!
<FACE,53,0>Why!?! This just can't be happening!
<FACE,53,0>The world is huge! I must redo my training!
<FACE,53,1>Your next adversary, KAREN, has a battle style that is entirely\nunlike mine. Now what will you do?
<FACE,53,1>A draw!?! Who in the world are you?
<FACE,53,1>You must have realized the extent of our power.

<FACE,29,0>I am KAREN. Would you care for a showdown with my DARK-type\nPOKéMON?
<FACE,29,0>You've assembled a charming team. Our battle should be a\ngood one.
<FACE,29,0>I am unlike the three you've already met.
<FACE,29,0>There!
<FACE,29,0>#26, go!
<FACE,29,0>#26, please!
<FACE,29,0>#26, don't fail me!
<FACE,29,0>#26, you know what to do!
<FACE,29,0>You're no good for this!
<FACE,29,0>Switch out!
<FACE,29,0>That should be enough!
<FACE,29,0>Good, that's enough!
<FACE,29,0>Hmm... Is that how you want to play it?
<FACE,29,0>It's a lot less complicated this way.
<FACE,29,0>We weren't deliberately aiming for the weak\nspot.
<FACE,29,0>It hit the weak spot precisely. You're good.
<FACE,29,0>That was a smart move.
<FACE,29,0>That showed subtle elegance.
<FACE,29,0>Nothing can be done about that.
<FACE,29,0>It's working well.
<FACE,29,0>This can't be happening!
<FACE,29,0><KONRAN,2>So? Isn't it outstanding?
<FACE,29,0><MEROMERO,4>Oh, look. It's infatuated.
<FACE,29,0><MAHI,2>I was hoping for that.
<FACE,29,0><WAZA,207,2>#26, be proud--SWAGGER.
<FACE,29,0>That's about what I expected.
<FACE,29,0>Well, that was relatively entertaining.
<FACE,29,0>Come visit me anytime.
<FACE,29,0>The CHAMPION is looking forward to meeting you.
<FACE,29,0>No! I can't win. How did you become so strong?
<FACE,29,0>I will not stray from my chosen path.
<FACE,29,0>A draw...? But how...?
<FACE,29,0>You're going to reappraise matters, aren't you?

<FACE,61,2>I'll lead with #26!
<FACE,61,2>Fine, #26!
<FACE,61,2>#26 for the win!
<FACE,61,2>Okay, #26!

<FACE,61,1>That's clever.
<FACE,61,0>Ugh... Um...
<FACE,61,1>Gotcha!

<FACE,61,2>That was close. Want to try again?
<FACE,61,2>I successfully defended my CHAMPIONSHIP.
<FACE,61,2>It's not that you are weak. Don't let it bother you.
<FACE,61,2>You got me. You are magnificent!
<FACE,61,2>This is the emergence of a new CHAMPION.
<FACE,61,2>I never expected another trainer to beat me... I'm surprised.
<FACE,61,2>That was an intense battle.

<FACE,35,0>No! No!

<FACE,35,1>Hey, wasn't that electrifying?
<FACE,35,1>Nice one! My POKéMON have become even mightier!
<FACE,35,0>Okay! I'll have to go back to camp and brush up on my training.

<FACE,26,1>When I watch the sea, my troubles get washed away. A battle?\nOkay!
<FACE,26,1>Aren't the ladies here lovely? Oh, you want to battle?
<FACE,26,1>Tweet! Start!
<FACE,26,1>#26, dash!
<FACE,26,0>#26, let's do it!
<FACE,26,0>How about #26?
<FACE,26,0>#26 can come out!
<FACE,26,1>Maybe I'll change!
<FACE,26,1>Maybe I won't use this one.
<FACE,26,1>I'll change it!
<FACE,26,1>I'll pull it from battle.
<FACE,26,0>Gwaaah! It's rocking!
<FACE,26,1>Ker-splash!

<FACE,26,0>I'd love to go to a tropical beach!
<FACE,26,0>I'm blissfully exhausted, like after a good swim.
<FACE,26,0>I was just goofin' around, but I won anyway. I guess you're\njust weak.
<FACE,26,1>You're not even good to practice on. I'll go challenge one of\nthese other trainers.
<FACE,26,1>Argh... I should become a BOARDER and wait for winter.
<FACE,26,1>I was just goofin' around and ended up losing.
<FACE,26,1>Okay! I'll be training in the tropical seas! Then again, I don't\nhave the travel budget!

<FACE,50,2>Any battle can be won by applying logic. What? You want to test\nmy hypothesis?
<FACE,50,2>Huh? Battle? I don't want to. Can't I just refuse?
<FACE,50,2>I don't want to see any rough stuff.
<FACE,50,2>Don't do anything mean to #26.
<FACE,50,2>Be nice. I really adore #26.

<FACE,50,0>Aiming for the weak spot... Isn't that a\npenalty?

<FACE,50,2>My logic is perfect! I don't like to battle, but I absolutely will\nnot lose!
<FACE,50,2>You can't win because you rely solely on instinct.
<FACE,50,2>I think that you need to study a whole lot more.
<FACE,50,0>Eeeek! How did my logic fail me?
<FACE,50,2>My logic wasn't faulty! There must still be a missing element.

<FACE,16,2>Want to meet the members of my band?
<FACE,16,0>I'll just go home and work on a ballad.
<FACE,16,0>Fade out! You can't do that live, though.
<FACE,16,2>Next time, I'll bring the whole band instead of playing solo.
<FACE,16,2>I guess I got careless in the battle.

<FACE,6,1>I like to fish when I go camping!
<FACE,6,1>You can see many POKéMON when you go\ncamping.
<FACE,6,1>The beach is nice, but the mountains are the\nbest.
<FACE,6,1>See? Aren't my POKéMON tough? 
<FACE,6,1>If you want tough POKéMON, you should go to the seas and\nmountains.
<FACE,6,1>I won! It was bound to happen, really. Your training was no match\nfor mine.
<FACE,6,0>How could this happen? I trained really, really hard.
<FACE,6,1>What? I lost? That's weird...
<FACE,6,1>Should I go look for stronger POKéMON?
<FACE,6,1>That was a good battle. By the way, do you like camping?
<FACE,6,1>Oh, wait! Where are you going?

<FACE,43,0>What's that? You've seen a BURGLAR around here?
<FACE,43,0>You're a tough one. Would you care to join the police force?
<FACE,43,0>Oops, my break is almost over. Thanks for your time.
<FACE,43,0>Well, that was a good battle.
<FACE,43,0>Be careful on your way home.

<FACE,33,1>A battle? That sounds rather frightening.
<FACE,33,1>Aren't my POKéMON attractive? Would you care to see them\nperform?
<FACE,33,1>I can't beat my mother or the senior girls in our troupe.
<FACE,33,1>May I begin?
<FACE,33,1>Go on. Get out there.
<FACE,33,1>#26, you're my choice.
<FACE,33,1>#26, I'm depending on you.
<FACE,33,1>Your opponent is close to falling.
<FACE,33,1>No, I'm giving you the hook.
<FACE,33,1>Wait. Please wait.
<FACE,33,1>May I have a moment?
<FACE,33,1>I beg your pardon.
<FACE,33,2>Aiyee! You're a tough audience!
<FACE,33,1>I'm elated!
<FACE,33,1>My, a critical hit. Please forgive me.
<FACE,33,0>Critical hit? No! How dare you!
<FACE,33,2>That was so unpleasant.
<FACE,33,1>This could be my big break!
<FACE,33,0>You have to endure this!
<FACE,33,1>Oh! I'm so happy!
<FACE,33,2>That was a terrible performance!
<FACE,33,1>Do you know of Kyoto?
<FACE,33,1>We all love POKéMON.
<FACE,33,1>POKéMON really are adorable, aren't they?
<FACE,33,1>We play with our POKéMON every day.
<FACE,33,1>Wouldn't you agree that I am quite good?
<FACE,33,1>Don't you think you should be a little more diligent and\ndetermined?
<FACE,33,1>I can finally beat someone. I'm delighted!
<FACE,33,2>What should I do? My mother will be disappointed.
<FACE,33,0>I don't like inflexible people like you! I don't want to know you!
<FACE,33,1>Please book us for a performance... How old did you say you were?
<FACE,33,1>Oh, a draw? I've never had one before.
<FACE,33,1>What's wrong? You're leaving?

<FACE,17,2>It's time to test my research results! Sorry, but you will be my\ntest subject.
<FACE,17,2>I was cooped up in the lab. I needed a break, so here I am.
<FACE,17,2>You study POKéMON, too? Let's compare our abilities!
<FACE,17,2>#26, it is!
<FACE,17,2>It's my #26!
<FACE,17,2>It's this one in this situation!
<FACE,17,2>I'll go with #26.
<FACE,17,2>#26! Go get 'em!
<FACE,17,2>I'll have to switch out...
<FACE,17,2>I'm changing POKéMON.
<FACE,17,2>Change!
<FACE,17,2>Good, #26. Come back.
<FACE,17,0>What!?!
<FACE,17,1>Yes!
<FACE,17,1>Hit the weak spot! Outstanding!
<FACE,17,0>Oh, no! It took that on its weak spot!
<FACE,17,0>Hmm... How vexing!
<FACE,17,1>Good. That's good.
<FACE,17,0>Rats...
<FACE,17,1>Yeah! Eureka!
<FACE,17,0>What is this phenomenon?!?
<FACE,17,2>What am I studying? That's top secret!
<FACE,17,2>Why am I a rogue? Who knows?
<FACE,17,2>Lack of research funding is a major\nconcern.
<FACE,17,2>My research is sure to evoke controversy in\nsociety.
<FACE,17,1>Ha, ha, ha... My hypothesis was correct.
<FACE,17,1>Maybe this will persuade them to raise my research budget.
<FACE,17,1>Did you see the fruits of my research?
<FACE,17,0>Waaah! I sneaked out of the lab for this... The chief's going to\nchew me out again...
<FACE,17,2>What? Did I make an error? That's odd. I'll have to review my\nresearch notes.
<FACE,17,0>What a disaster! I can't present this to the Academy...
<FACE,17,2>I didn't lose, that's what matters. But, then again, I didn't win...

<FACE,14,0>Perhaps I will start with #26.
<FACE,14,0>This one will do.
<FACE,14,0>I'll go with this one.
<FACE,14,0>Will this one do?

<FACE,14,0>Hmm...
<FACE,14,0>Is that so...
<FACE,14,0>I see. Forgive me.
<FACE,14,0>Hmm...
<FACE,14,0>Travel is rewarding.
<FACE,14,0>POKéMON are wonderful creatures.
<FACE,14,0>Battles make a person better.
<FACE,14,0>POKéMON make people more compassionate.
<FACE,14,0>Hmm... Good battle. You were outstanding.
<FACE,14,0>I forgot about my age and became serious. I owe it all to you.
<FACE,14,0>Thank you. I understand that there are magnificent trainers\neverywhere.
<FACE,14,0>Although I lost, I feel exhilarated. Thank you.
<FACE,14,0>I did the best I could, so I don't feel any resentment. You truly\nare strong.

<FACE,26,1><WAZA,112,2>Put up a BARRIER!
<FACE,26,1><WAZA,57,4>You ridin' that SURF?
<FACE,26,1><WAZA,127,4>I remember the time I swam up a waterfall...
<FACE,26,1>The plan worked! I hope I get extra credit!
<FACE,26,0>Defense is the greatest offense!
<FACE,26,1>Wasn't that a good plan? I wish I had shown it to a lady\nSWIMMER...
<FACE,26,1>A move that isn't affected by defense... Is there such a thing?
<FACE,26,1>Snivel... My plan failed...
<FACE,26,0>Okay! I'll be training in the tropical seas! Then again, I don't\nhave the travel budget!
<FACE,26,1>Neither of us were serious enough.
<FACE,26,1>Let's go to an indoor pool where it's warm.

<FACE,57,2>Can you dodge my <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>SKULL BASH<COL1,POP>?
<FACE,57,2>Bang, bang, bang!
<FACE,57,2>It's #26!

<FACE,57,1>There's the weak spot! It's yours,\n#26!
<FACE,57,0>Oh! You goof! Don't get hit there!
<FACE,57,2>Ohh... That's not good...
<FACE,57,1>Yeah! Exactly as planned!

<FACE,57,1><WAZA,144,1>I'll show you a really neat move.
<FACE,57,1>Ha, ha, ha! It took the shot without blinking! Isn't its power\nawesome?
<FACE,57,1>Nothing can dodge this move! It's a knockout every time!
<FACE,57,1>Ha, ha, ha! I told you you couldn't dodge it!
<FACE,57,0>Huh? I lost? You're kidding, right?
<FACE,57,2>Those were my favorite moves...
<FACE,57,2>I relied too heavily on <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>SOLARBEAM<COL1,POP> and <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>SKULL BASH<COL1,POP>...
<FACE,57,2>That's strange. A draw?
<FACE,57,0>Huh? You're surrendering already? That was simple!

<FACE,42,2>Do you find my POKéMON nice? They're very forgetful.
<FACE,42,1>Hip, hip, hooray!

<FACE,42,2><WAZA,133,4>I often get scolded for forgetting things.

<FACE,42,1><FACE,42,1>See? Isn't <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>AMNESIA<COL1,POP> amazing?
<FACE,42,1><COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>AMNESIA<COL1,POP> makes my SPECIAL DEFENSE complete!

<FACE,42,0>Waaaaah! I'm going to tell EARL!
<FACE,42,0>Aaah! That's so annoying. After all the effort of using <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>AMNESIA<COL1,POP>!
<FACE,42,1>I've already forgotten about losing! ...Just kidding!
<FACE,42,2>Hmm... I guess these things happen.

<FACE,38,2><COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>DOUBLE TEAM<COL1,POP>'s effect can be lifted.\nI've heard that there's a move that can do that.
<FACE,38,1>I've heard that <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>SWIFT<COL1,POP> never misses. Is that true?
<FACE,38,2>I think that there are moves that restore elusiveness to normal.
<FACE,38,0>I... I lost. Sob... Just joking!
<FACE,38,0>You did it... Grrrrr...
<FACE,38,0>This is the first time that we were hit so often.

<FACE,33,2>Aiyee! You're a tough audience!
<FACE,33,1>I'm elated!
<FACE,33,1>My, a critical hit. Please forgive me.
<FACE,33,0>Critical hit? No! How dare you!
<FACE,33,2>That was so unpleasant.

<FACE,33,1>We play with our POKéMON every day.
<FACE,33,1>My POKéMON are adept at using DREAM EATER.
<FACE,33,1>Could your POKéMON be holding items that aren't appropriate?

<FACE,57,2><WAZA,91,4>I'd like to DIG underground and skip class!
<FACE,57,1>You must like battling POKéMON, too.

<FACE,57,1>As promised, I knocked your socks off!
<FACE,57,1>Heh. Makes it hard to attack, doesn't it?
<FACE,57,0>I got beaten! ...I guess I was a little too complacent.
<FACE,57,2>What moves can be used against a POKéMON that uses <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>FLY<COL1,POP> or <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>DIG<COL1,POP>?\nI'm not telling!

<FACE,25,1>Our special defense is secure! <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>LIGHT SCREEN<COL1,POP>, we've got it!
<FACE,25,1>Our special defense is secure!
<FACE,25,1>Oh? Coming at me with PSYCHIC-type POKéMON? I've prepared\nfor that!
<FACE,25,1>How you lead is important!
<FACE,25,2>It has to be #26!
<FACE,25,2>I learned that I should go with #26.
<FACE,25,2>#26 fits the formula!
<FACE,25,2>My teacher tells me #26!
<FACE,25,2>Switch out.
<FACE,25,2>I'll switch this.
<FACE,25,2>This is where it gets interesting.
<FACE,25,2>I'm pulling it back.
<FACE,25,0>Whaaat! That's ridiculous!
<FACE,25,1>Oh, yeah! Just like they taught me!
<FACE,25,1>Hitting the weak point? That was just lucky.
<FACE,25,0>Why! Why did it hit the weak spot?
<FACE,25,0>What are you supposed to do when this\nhappens?
<FACE,25,1>That certainly worked.
<FACE,25,0>Oh, there's nothing I can do.
<FACE,25,1>This is great! Battles are so much fun!
<FACE,25,0>Aiyee! Aiyaiyaiyeee!
<FACE,25,1><WAZA,113,3>Form a LIGHT SCREEN!
<FACE,25,1><DOKUDOKU, 3>Ha, ha, ha... Gotcha!
<FACE,25,1><WAZA,94,4>PSYCHIC, now!
<FACE,25,1><WAZA,9,4>Go with a THUNDERPUNCH!
<FACE,25,1>Perfection!
<FACE,25,1>I did it! A victory of brain over brawn!
<FACE,25,1>I won again! You obviously haven't done your homework.
<FACE,25,0>Whaaaat!?! Th-that's allowed?
<FACE,25,0>That's strange... I did exactly as I was taught...
<FACE,25,0>I haven't been taught that yet...
<FACE,25,2>That's disappointing. What did I do wrong?
<FACE,25,1>You're going to do your homework? You're surprisingly\nresponsible.

<FACE,10,2><COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>HYPER BEAM<COL1,POP>'s power is outrageous.\nWhich POKéMON wants to take it?
<FACE,10,2><COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>HYPER BEAM<COL1,POP> can KO most POKéMON with one shot.
<FACE,10,2>Have a blast of <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>HYPER BEAM<COL1,POP>. It's a one-hit KO for most POKéMON.
<FACE,10,2>#26, it's your job!
<FACE,10,2>#26, get out there!
<FACE,10,2>I'm counting on you, #26!
<FACE,10,2>#26, it's you!
<FACE,10,2>#26, what a chance!
<FACE,10,2>Come back, #26!
<FACE,10,2>Enough, #26!
<FACE,10,1>Way to work, #26!
<FACE,10,1>I tip my hat to you, #26!
<FACE,10,2>Whoa! That was radical!
<FACE,10,1>How's that!
<FACE,10,1>Yeah! Popped it where it hurts the most!\nThat's the idea!
<FACE,10,0>Yikes! Took it where it hurts! 
<FACE,10,0>Whoa, no!
<FACE,10,1>Looking good.
<FACE,10,0>Uh-oh... Hang tough!
<FACE,10,1>And there we have it. Thanks so much!
<FACE,10,0>Waaah... Down and out...
<FACE,10,2><WAZA,63,3>Go! HYPER BEAM!
<FACE,10,2>Your POKéMON are well trained.
<FACE,10,2>Your POKéMON have been raised meticulously.
<FACE,10,1><MEROMERO,2>Quite elegant, wouldn't you say?
<FACE,10,1>The items that POKéMON hold are pretty important.
<FACE,10,2>Apparently, some items have no effect unless they are held by\ncertain POKéMON.
<FACE,10,1>...Your POKéMON are holding some nice items.
<FACE,10,0>I'm going to learn from this and move on! ...What's that look\nyou're giving me?
<FACE,10,2>What? How could you battle that way? I... I can't believe it...
<FACE,10,0>This can't be possible... How could I lose with my level advantage?
<FACE,10,2>Whew... We must be evenly matched.
<FACE,10,1>Oh, you're quitting? Lucky for me!

<FACE,9,2>Oh my... Will those POKéMON be able to keep up with our speed?
<FACE,9,2>Your POKéMON look rather languid. Can they keep up with our\nspeed?
<FACE,9,2>My POKéMON are wickedly fast!
<FACE,9,2>Number one! #26!
<FACE,9,2>#26, let's go!
<FACE,9,2>It has to be #26!
<FACE,9,2>#26 will do.
<FACE,9,2>#26 will tend to you.
<FACE,9,2>Draw back for now!
<FACE,9,2>#26, come back!
<FACE,9,2>#26, you were good!
<FACE,9,2>#26, you worked hard!
<FACE,9,0>...Oh... What power!?!
<FACE,9,1>Bingo! Just as I imagined!
<FACE,9,1>Yes! That hit the weak spot! Just as I\nplanned it!
<FACE,9,2>Critical hit? That one couldn't be helped.
<FACE,9,0>Oh! That's a little annoying!
<FACE,9,2>So... We do this now and...
<FACE,9,0>Awww, that's so tedious.
<FACE,9,1>And that's the game! Ha, ha, ha...
<FACE,9,0>Owww... Crash and burn...
<FACE,9,2><WAZA,63,3>How's this!?! HYPER BEAM!
<FACE,9,2><WAZA,96,3>We'll MEDITATE... Now we're all ready!
<FACE,9,2><WAZA,14,3>SWORDS DANCE gets it raring to go!
<FACE,9,2>Some people would rather collect POKéMON.
<FACE,9,1>It could have been dangerous if you had used <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>ENDURE<COL1,POP> smartly.\nOh, um... Never mind.
<FACE,9,1>Ha, ha, ha! That was a cakewalk!
<FACE,9,2>If you get hit squarely by <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>HYPER BEAM<COL1,POP>, of course you're going\nto lose.
<FACE,9,0>I'm so angry! I don't think I can eat tonight.
<FACE,9,0>You're atrocious! I'm going to tell EARL!
<FACE,9,0>Waaaah! I don't like you at all! Yuck!
<FACE,9,0>Arrrgh! So close! If only that had worked...
<FACE,9,2>...Will you battle with me again?

<FACE,24,0>Let me see your combos!
<FACE,24,0>I'd like to see some elegant combos. My DRAGONITE and\nTYRANITAR will take you on.
<FACE,24,0>Come try your combos on me.
<FACE,24,1>Okay, it's showtime!
<FACE,24,1>#26 shall do.
<FACE,24,1>Perhaps #26.
<FACE,24,1>#26, go!
<FACE,24,1>#26 shall put this to rest.
<FACE,24,1>Well, then...
<FACE,24,1>Another one will take its place.
<FACE,24,1>How's this?
<FACE,24,1>...And now...
<FACE,24,0>Argh! I blew that!
<FACE,24,1>There! ...There it goes.
<FACE,24,0>Ha, ha, ha. Weak spot, eh? This is unfolding\nexactly as I had envisioned it.
<FACE,24,1>Argh... What? A critical hit? How did that\nhappen?
<FACE,24,1>Feeling stressed?
<FACE,24,0>Oh, devious.
<FACE,24,1>My, my, my...
<FACE,24,1>I'd say my mood is buoyant!
<FACE,24,0>Ack... I slipped up!
<FACE,24,1><WAZA,17,4>DRAGONITE, WING ATTACK!
<FACE,24,1><WAZA,157,4>TYRANITAR, create a ROCK SLIDE!
<FACE,24,1><WAZA,57,4>SURF!
<FACE,24,1><WAZA,53,4>Burn!
<FACE,24,0>Didn't I tell you? You don't stand a chance if you can't pull off\ncombos.
<FACE,24,0>Why don't you join me on the road? I could teach you about\ncombos.
<FACE,24,0>Heh, what do you know? I started studying battle strategies only\nrecently.
<FACE,24,1>I guess it's about time for me to move on from here...
<FACE,24,1>I just got here... How could I lose so quickly?
<FACE,24,1>My performance still needs some work. I'm going home to train by\njuggling 100 times.
<FACE,24,0>A draw is no good! Let's do it again!
<FACE,24,0>Join me on the road sometime.
