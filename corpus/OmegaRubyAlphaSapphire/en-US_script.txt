They say, here in Hoenn, there are places\ncalled Mirage spots.\c\nOne does not simply walk into a Mirage spot.\c\nNot to mention that these places also\nappear and disappear mysteriously.
I’ve been to a Mirage spot...\nI’m sure of it. But I forgot where it is...\c\nI used to be very good at\nremembering things...\c\nI’m so shocked that I can’t remember...

Hmm...\nIt’s not bad, but it’s also not good.\c\nYou, as the Trainer, need to put in\nsome more effort.

In the Hoenn region, there are three Pokémon\nthat represent the power of rock, ice, and steel.\c\nEach is said to hide away deep inside a cave.\c\nThat’s the story I heard when I was just a little kid.

“Six dots open three doors.”\c\nGrandpa used to say that, but I don’t know what\nhe meant.
“Six dots open three doors.”\c\nGrandpa used to say that,\nand I was always wondering what he meant.\c\nI had no idea that it was some secret to\nmeet special Pokémon.\c\nHe told me another story, too.\nI wonder if this has some hidden meaning, too...
Grandpa used to say\nthat this huge Pokémon\r\nsometimes visits our region.\c\nBut you’ll need to have\nsomething cold to meet it...\c\nI wonder what he meant.\nIce cream, maybe?
Grandpa used to say that\nthis huge Pokémon sometimes\r\nvisits our region.\c\nHe told me that it comes to visit\nthis iceberg kind of Pokémon.\c\nI can only think of one kind\nof iceberg Pokémon...
Grandpa used to say that\nthis huge Pokémon sometimes\r\nvisits our region.\c\nBut you’ll need to have three of\nits friends with you to meet it...\c\nI wonder what Pokémon they are.\nDoes it have to do with the six dots?
Grandpa used to say that this huge\nPokémon sometimes visits our region.\c\nBut he said you’ll need to wait in the\nmiddle when it’s bright and Hoenn\r\nis overflowing with natural energy.\c\nI wonder if he meant you can’t meet it at night.
Grandpa originally came from a\ncold region. He told me lots of myths.

Pacifidlog Town floats on top\nof a colony of Corsola.\c\nIf I told you something like that,\nwould you believe me?
It’s said that the ancestors of the people in\nPacifidlog were born on their boats and died on\r\ntheir boats, living their whole lives on the sea.\c\nIt’s said that they lived that way because they\nwere searching for something.

It’s extremely friendly toward you.\nIt couldn’t possibly love you more.\r\nIt’s a pleasure to see!
It seems to be very happy.\nIt’s obviously friendly toward you.
It’s quite friendly toward you.\nIt seems to want to be babied a little.
It’s getting used to you.\nIt seems to believe in you.
It’s not very used to you yet.\nIt neither loves nor hates you.
It’s very wary.\nIt has a scary look in its eyes.\r\nIt doesn’t like you much at all.
This is a little hard for me to say...\c\nYour Pokémon simply detests you.\nDoesn’t that make you uncomfortable?

Oh!

Wally...\nI hope you’re all right out there...
Is that right?\nWally made it all that way on his own...\c\nHe may be my little brother’s boy, but I\nfeel as proud as I would if he was mine!
Oh! You’re the [VAR TRNAME(0000)] who\nWally was telling me about.\c\nI’m Wally’s cousin, Wanda!
Don’t you worry about Wally.\nHe’ll be just fine, I’m sure.\c\nI know my little cousin, and he\nhas his Pokémon with him, too!
Thanks to you, I can see\nmy girlfriend every day.\r\nHappy? You bet I am!
My daughter’s boyfriend is a very\ndriven and passionate sort of person.\c\nHe’s been digging a tunnel nonstop\njust so he can see my daughter.\c\nMy daughter’s a little concerned,\nso she goes out to the tunnel a lot.
It’s amazing. My daughter’s boyfriend\nwas digging the tunnel by hand!\c\nIt’s so incredible!
If anything were to happen to Wally,\nI would never be able to look his\r\nparents in Petalburg in the eyes...
Wally was in Ever Grande?\c\nHis parents in Petalburg would be\nastonished to hear that!
Why, it feels like it’s been ages\nsince we saw you last!
What wonderful timing! I was thinking\nthat I wanted to give this to you...
I didn’t really thank you properly when you\nhelped smash those rocks in the tunnel.
Do you remember how light came\nfalling out of the sky a while ago?\c\nI found this in the yard that day.\c\nActually, I found two, and I gave\nthe other to Wally.\c\nIt’s a pretty stone, and I’m sure\nyour Pokémon would be delighted\r\nif you let one of them hold it!

My papa told me this tunnel is full of timid Pokémon that\nget all scared of loud noises and make a big uproar!\c\nSo they had to stop the big tunnel project, but there’s\none man who’s still trying to dig the tunnel by himself!
There was a man who dug a\ntunnel for a lady he loved.\c\nThat’s really kind of amazing!
With the way the winds blow, volcanic ash is never\nblown in this direction.\c\nThat means that the air is clean and delicious here!\nIt could surely do wonders for the frail and sickly.
I’ve been feeling pretty confident about\nthe cuteness of my Pokémon.\c\nSo I came here to make its presence\nfelt in the Contest Spectacular!

Y-you see...\c\nProfessor Cozmo...
It’s ridiculous...\nProfessor Cozmo...
He got abducted by some weird guys calling\nthemselves Team Something or Other...
They say that he was just up and kidnapped by some\nnuts calling themselves Team Something or Other...
Those shady characters...\nThey called themselves Team Magma.
Those shady characters...\nThey called themselves Team Aqua.
It seems as though they plan to do\nsomething with the Meteorite that\r\nthe professor has been researching.\c\nThe professor is just too gullible.\nIf you show the least bit of interest\r\nin his research, he would happily go\r\nwith you anywhere, without question.
[VAR TRNAME(0000)], please...\nYou’ve got to help me save him!\c\nThey can’t be planning to do anything\ngood with Professor Cozmo’s research.\c\nWe have to do something!
[VAR TRNAME(0000)]...\nI know it’s a lot to ask, but we’ve gotta help Cozmo!\c\nI can’t just stand by here and watch them use his\nlife’s work for their own corrupt reasons!
I...I’m going to head after them right away!\nLet’s meet up at Meteor Falls!
I’m going to head to Meteor Falls right away.\nCome catch up to me as soon as you can.
I’m counting on you, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!
I’m counting on you, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!
Ahhh! Professor!\c\nThank the stars above!\nProfessor, you’re back!
Hah...haha...\nThanks to these children, I have somehow returned.
Those crazy jerks...\c\nWhat do you think they wanted with the professor’s\nMeteorite anyway?
Those nuts back there...\c\nWhat do you think they’re hoping to do with the\nprofessor’s Meteorite?
I’ve gotta say, they sure didn’t look like the\ngood guys...but...
From the look of them, they kind of seem like\nbad guys, but...
I guess we’d both better be careful from here on out.\c\nNot that I’m really worried about you, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].\nYou and your team’d be fine for sure.

But I need to thank you, as well.\nYou truly saved me from disaster.\c\nI hope you’ll take this TM as some small form\nof repayment.
As long as the professor is safe and sound,\nI don’t need anything else...
It’s a cutting-edge telescope!\c\nIt seems to be focused on some\nparticular sector of space!
There are many books and papers\nabout Meteorites!\c\n“Relativity of Meteorites and Energy\nVol. 1: Pokémon”\c\n“Relativity of Meteorites and Energy\nVol. 2: Humanity”\c\n“Relativity of Meteorites and Energy\nVol. 3: Nature”
Thank you, Professor.
Wow! Thanks, Professor!
Now that that’s over with...\c\nWhat’re you planning to do next, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]?
We-e-ell...\c\nWhat’re you gonna do next, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]?
I’m thinking of going for my next Gym Badge.\c\nThe one from Mauville City.
I’m thinking of checking out the next Gym on my list.\c\nIt’s the one in Mauville City.
Wanna make the trip together, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]?\nTo Mauville, that is.
Why don’t you come with me, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]?\nTo Mauville!
Ah, right.\nWell, tell me if you change your mind.\c\nMauville’s right in the middle of Hoenn,\nso you can go to all sorts of places from there.\c\nEven Mt. Chimney, the place those guys\nwere talking about at Meteor Falls, is\r\na pretty short trip from Mauville.
Oh. Right.\nWell, tell me if you change your mind!\c\nMauville’s right in the middle of Hoenn,\nso you can go to all sorts of places from there.\c\nEven Mt. Chimney, the place those guys\nwere talking about at Meteor Falls, in fact.\r\nIt’s just a short trip from Mauville.
Cool. Let’s go then.
Right on!\nLet’s hit the road!
Oh! Why, hello again!
What good fortune...\c\nI’d been thinking that if I saw you again,\nI would want to give you this...
I happened to pick this up some\ntime ago, while doing excavation\r\nat Meteor Falls.\c\nI hoped it might help you and your\nteam along on your journey.\c\nBut I’m still astounded by it all.
A relationship between the Mega Stones, Key\nStones, and the Meteorites...\c\nMy, but new facts do come to light every day!\nThis is what makes my research feel worthwhile!
I know a man, a dear friend in the Kalos region, who\nhas been researching Mega Evolution.\c\nWe worked together a few years back here at Meteor Falls\nresearching Meteorites.\c\nI’ll have to share this information with him at once.\c\nIt might propel his research forward, and help future\nTrainers and Pokémon. I hope it does.
Oh, welcome, welcome!\nMake yourself at home.

Hmmm...\c\nI was keeping my excitement to myself until yesterday,\nbut my Pokémon and I weren’t quite good enough today!\c\nPerhaps the eyes of the judges become\nmore discerning at higher ranks.
What’s that? Is it this machine next\nto me that you’re interested in?
I just love making Pokéblocks!\c\nIn the old days it used to take four of us\nto make a Pokéblock with this machine.

That performance by Lisia and\nAli just now was amazing!
Hey, you were really impressed, too, right?\nThat’s what you call a [VAR COLOR(0002)]Spectacular Talent[VAR COLOR(0000)]!\c\nPokémon show off their talents until the\nexcitement in the hall is at its peak.\c\nThen their allure can’t be held back and comes\nbursting out as a [VAR COLOR(0002)]Spectacular Talent[VAR COLOR(0000)]!
That really was amazingly lovely!\nI’ll give it a try, too, next time!
It’s a big machine with a speed\nindicator and a meter.

Oh, hello.\nYou are?
OK, you’re [VAR TRNAME(0000)].\nI can see that you’re a Trainer.\c\nSo that means you use the Pokémon\nStorage System I developed.\c\nHow I arrived at that conclusion is\na simple deductive process.\c\nYou spoke to me because you wanted\nto access something on this PC.
Oh, I’m sorry. I’m Lanette.\c\nHonestly, I’m glad to meet you. It’s\ngreat you’re using the Storage System.\c\nIf you could, please visit me at home.\nMy house is on Route 114.
I wonder what Pokémon looked like\nlong, long ago.\c\nMaybe the Fossil Maniac at the edge\nof town will know.
In the fields of Fallarbor, we plant\nseedlings of hardy trees that thrive\r\neven in volcanic ash.
Oh... I see.\nThat’s how you attract wild Pokémon.\r\nThen I don’t need this anymore.
Give it a try if you like.
The Aha! Pokémon Journal gives us a lot of\nuseful information, doesn’t it?\c\nBy the way, I have more Honey at home,\nso I’ll bring some more tomorrow.
Hi!\nI still have some Honey,\r\nso take this.
Aha! Pokémon Journal\c\nDo you know the Pokémon move\ncalled Sweet Scent?\c\nIf you use it in tall grass, Pokémon\ncome out in a horde!

I’m having a hard time deciding if I should make\nmy Skitty evolve or not.\c\nI only have to use this Moon Stone, is all.\nIt’s so hard to decide, though.\c\nIf I make it evolve, it will become much stronger.\nBut it will look so different, too.

This Nugget I found here...\nI suppose I just ought to sell it, huh?\c\nLet me share a little nugget of wisdom, kid.\nDon’t hold on to your assets too long.\r\nCash is king in this world!

What’s up, what’s up?\c\nI saw some shady fellows scuttling in\nand out of Professor Cozmo’s lab.
This region’s been known for meteors\nsince the olden days.\c\nThey say Meteor Falls was gouged out\nby a falling meteoroid long ago.
See! Take a look!\nThis is my precious Marill!\c\nIt’s slick and smooth and plushy!\c\nIf you, too, have a Marill with you,\nyou can pet its slick and smooth and\r\nplushy fur as much as you want!

Have you already challenged Flannery,\nthe Leader of Lavaridge Gym?\c\nThe girl’s grandfather was famous.\nHe was one of the Elite Four in the\r\nPokémon League at one point.\c\nIt wouldn’t surprise me to see Flannery\nbecome a great Trainer in her own right.

You’ve come all the way to look\nat herbal medicine in Lavaridge?\c\nThat’s rather commendable!\c\nI like you! Take this!
That Charcoal I gave you is used\nfor making herbal medicine.\c\nIt can also do wonders when held\nby a Pokémon.\c\nIt powers up Fire-type moves!
Herbal medicine works impressively well.\nBut your Pokémon will dislike you for it.\r\nIt must be horribly bitter!
The display reads:\nThe more bitter it tastes, the better it works!

It seems to me that the more\nI walk with my Pokémon, the\r\nfriendlier they become toward me.
I gave a Red Pokéblock to my Pokémon.\nIt looks a lot cooler all of a sudden.\c\nHmm...\nMaybe I ought to eat a Red Pokéblock.
How disappointing.\c\nTraveled all the way from Kalos dreaming\nof the hot springs over there...\c\nCome to find they are for Pokémon only...\nSigh. It can’t be helped.\c\nIt seems there are hot springs in the Gym, too,\nso I should give them a try...
Moomoo Milk?\c\nIt’s great before entering the hot spring!\nAnd even better afterward. How about some?
I’ll take one.
I’ll take a dozen!
I’ll pass.
Here’s your Moomoo Milk.\nDrink up!
It’s $500 for one bottle!
It’s $6,000 for a dozen!
Well, now I feel udder-ly useless!
You don’t have enough money.
You can’t buy any more.

Yo, how’s it going,\nChamp-to-be [VAR TRNAME(0000)]?\c\nLavaridge’s Gym Leader Flannery\nuses Fire-type Pokémon.\c\nHer passion for Pokémon burns\nstronger and hotter than a volcano.\c\nDon’t get too close to her or you\nmight get burned. Hose her down\r\nwith water and then go for it!
Yow! That was a scorching hot battle!

Welcome!
No, wait. I mean...\nPuny Trainer, you’ve done well to make it this far!\c\nLet’s see. I’m, uh, honored to be serving as the\nGym Leader of...
No, I mean...\nI’m Flannery, and I’m in charge here!
Uh...\nYou’d better not underestimate me just ’cause\r\nI’ve only been Leader a short time!
With the skills inherited from my grandfather,\nI’m gonna, uh, demonstrate the hot moves\r\nwe’ve honed in this land!
Haiyaaaaaaaaaaaaa!
[~ 23]
I...I’ve only recently become a Gym Leader.\nI guess I was trying too hard to be someone\r\nI’m not.
When I don’t act like myself, no wonder Pokémon\nthat battle at my side get confused.
Thank you for teaching me that.\nYou deserve this.
[VAR TRNAME(0000)] received the Heat Badge\nfrom Flannery.
If you have a Heat Badge, all Pokémon up to Level 50,\neven those you get in trades from other people, will obey\r\nyou completely.\c\nAnd it lets Pokémon use the HM move Strength\noutside of battle.
This is a token of my appreciation.\nDon’t be shy about taking it!
Overheat is a Fire-type move that inflicts serious\ndamage on the target.\c\nBut it also sharply cuts the Sp. Atk of the Pokémon\nusing it. It might not be suitable for longer battles.
Your power reminds me of someone...\c\nOh! I know! You battle like Norman,\nthe Gym Leader of Petalburg.
Lavaridge Town Pokémon Gym\c\nFlannery’s Certified Trainers:\nWally

The Sturdy Ability protects Pokémon from one-hit KO\nmoves like Fissure!\c\nBut that’s not all!\c\nIt also protects the Pokémon when a normal attack\nwas strong enough to have made it faint in one blow.\c\nI want to acquire that kind of raging strength of my\nown as a single man!
On Mt. Chimney’s peak, there’s a local\nspecialty that you can buy only there.\c\nGive one to a Pokémon—it will be elated.

[VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\nWow, it’s a relief to see you in one piece!
Oh, well, you know...\nThe last time I saw you was right after\r\nbattling those Team Whatsit people...\c\nSo I was a bit worried, thinking about\nwhat might have happened to you\r\nafter that, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]...
...What?\nYou battled them AGAIN after that?\r\nAnd you BEAT them!\c\nYou really are something else, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].\nI-I mean, you and your team are.\r\nI’m pretty impressed by you all!\c\nAnd that pretty stone that’s sparkling there...\nIs that the Meteorite you got back from them?
Oh, that’s right! Here! Here!\nI’ve been thinking of giving these to you.
If you put on those Go-Goggles, you’ll be\nall set heading into the desert on Route 111.
...Oh! And isn’t that—\nThat’s Lavaridge’s Gym Badge!\c\nSo you beat Flannery, too?\c\nI guess you really are training\nyour Pokémon right...
Next up will be challenging your\ndad, Norman, in Petalburg, right?
I’m headed to Petalburg’s\nGym next myself...
Do you want to go back together?\nBack to Petalburg?
Aye aye!\nThen let’s hit the road!
Oh, yeah?\c\nWell, I’ll still be here in Lavaridge for a\nwhile, so find me if you think you’d like\r\na little company on the road after all.
[VAR TRNAME(0000)], hey!\nSo you were all right, huh?
Oh, well, you know...\nThe last time I saw you, you were mixed\r\nup with those “Team Whatsit” people...\c\nSo I just wondered if you’d gotten\nback on the road after that.\c\nIt was, like, I don’t know...\nI guess I was a bit...worried?
What?\nYou battled them AGAIN after that?\r\nAnd you even managed to beat them?\c\nYou really are something else, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]...\nYou and your Pokémon. Your team.\c\nAnd that...that sparkle there...\nIs that the Meteorite you got back from them?
...Oh, right!\nI forgot to give you these before.
Keep those with you if you’re planning on\ngoing into that desert near Route 111.\c\nThere should be some Pokémon that only\nmake their habitat in the desert, you know.\r\nYou might check ’em out—if you’re up to it.
And... Huh?\c\nYou got the Lavaridge Badge!\c\nSo you even beat Flannery, huh?\c\nLooks like you’ve been taking\nproper care of your Pokémon.
Guess that means...that you’ll be\nheaded to Petalburg City next, huh?\r\nTo challenge your dad at his Gym?
W-well, if you are...\c\nI just happened to be thinking of\ngoing to Petalburg myself, so...
How about it?\nWanna go back to Petalburg together?
Y-yeah?\nThen let’s hit it!
O-oh... Yeah, I get it...\c\nBut, well, I’ll probably still be\nhere in Lavaridge for a while.\c\nSo if you decide to head for\nPetalburg, um, let me know.
I have here an Egg.\c\nI’d hoped to hatch it by covering it in\nhot sand by the hot springs.\r\nBut that doesn’t seem to be enough...\c\nI’ve heard it would be best if it were\nkept together with Pokémon and\r\ncarried about.
You are a Trainer, yes?\nAnd your Pokémon radiate vitality.\c\nSo, what say you?\nWill you take this Egg to hatch?
Good! I hope you’ll walk plenty with\nthis here Egg!
[VAR TRNAME(0000)] received the Egg.
Oh. You have too many Pokémon.\c\nTalk to me again when you have room\nfor this Egg.
As you wish, then...\c\nIf you have a change of heart about\nhatching this Egg, I will be here.
Every so often, an Egg will be found at\nthe Pokémon Day Care.\c\nOr at least that’s how the rumor goes.
Your Pokémon radiate vitality as usual.\c\nWhat say you?\nWill you take another Egg to hatch?
We draw as much hot water as we need,\nand yet the hot springs never run dry.\c\nIsn’t it magical?\c\nThese hot springs appear near active\nvolcanoes. Veins of water under the\r\nground are heated by magma to well up\r\nas hot springs.
I was buried in this hot sand, enjoying\nthe heavenly warmth of a sand bath.\c\nI was just thinking I could really get used to this,\nwhen a Pokémon went and nipped my backside!\c\nGyahhh!
Oh, you like hot springs, do you?\c\nThat’s surprising for one as young\nas you.
I bathe in the hot springs every day.\c\nI want to become a beautiful and strong\nGym Leader like Flannery.
If people put Pokémon in hot springs,\nthe results could be seriously strange.\c\nIt might create a bubble bath or even\na lava bath!
They’re claiming that these hot springs\nare good to calm nervous tensions,\r\nrelax aching muscles, solve romantic\r\nproblems, and attract money...
Lavaridge Town\c\nPokémon Center Hot Springs\nAn excellent place for relaxing!

Suh-words Dance!\c\nYou use soulful dance for to make\npower of Pokémon go up, up!\c\nIt is the way of karate I seek!

I wrote a theme song for those [VAR ITEM2(0000)]\nschools that are popular right now.\r\nGive it a listen!\c\nOh! [VAR ITEM2(0000)] schools!\nWonderful [VAR ITEM2(0000)] schools!
Hmm...\c\nYou should work more on your singing\nthan [VAR ITEM2(0000)] schools.
Man, I just can’t wait for the\n[VAR ITEM2(0000)] party!\c\nWe have to have a really splendid party!
Yes, even the TV news might come to\nreport on the [VAR ITEM2(0000)] party.\c\nIt’s an event with a lot of history, after all.
My big brother all of a sudden quit his\njob and said he’s going to try to become\r\na real [VAR ITEM2(0000)] master.\c\nWhat do you think? Can he make it as\na professional [VAR ITEM2(0000)] master?
Hmm, I don’t know.\c\nIt’s hard to become a professional [VAR ITEM2(0000)]\nmaster with a halfhearted effort.\c\nI think your big brother has what it takes\nto be a great [VAR ITEM2(0000)] master, though.\c\nI’m sure he can do it!
I saw one of those [VAR ITEM2(0000)] festivals.\nJealous?\c\nThe real thing was awesome!
That [VAR ITEM2(0000)] festival wasn’t real!\c\nThe real one is better...\nPrettier...\c\nAnyway, it’s just really cool!
We talked about this before, but let’s have a big\n[VAR ITEM2(0000)] dance party on this island!
Oh, good idea! We can decide who has\nthe best [VAR ITEM2(0000)] dance moves!\c\nI’ll spend all my time working on my\n[VAR ITEM2(0000)] dance moves from now on!
I was feeling down yesterday because I lost\nmy wallet, but my mom cheered me up with\r\na lovely [VAR ITEM2(0000)] song.\c\nThat [VAR ITEM2(0000)] song\ntouched my heart.
Ah, to be able to sing a beautiful\n[VAR ITEM2(0000)] song...\c\nYour mom must be a really good singer!\nI’d like to hear her sing once.
Well...\c\n[VAR ITEM2(0000)] collections aren’t just a\ntrend anymore. They feel like a part of my life now.
Is it really like that?!\c\nIt’s [VAR ITEM2(0000)] collections\nall day every day with you!\c\nYou’re like some kind of\n[VAR ITEM2(0000)]-collection professor!
If you and I team up, we’ll be unstoppable\nat [VAR ITEM2(0000)] quality!
You said it!\c\nWe’ll be like Team [VAR ITEM2(0000)]\nQuality! Hahaha!
My dream is to save up some money to build my very\nown [VAR ITEM2(0000)] house in Slateport,\r\nwhere I’ve always wanted to live.\c\nCome for a visit when it’s built!
Wow, if you really build your own [VAR ITEM2(0000)]\nhouse, it’ll become a landmark in Slateport!\c\nHere’s hoping you build a huge\n[VAR ITEM2(0000)] house!
Pokédexes are all right, but...\c\nI think it’s [VAR ITEM2(0000)]-dexes’ time now.\nThey’re worth looking into.
[VAR ITEM2(0000)]-dexes, huh?\nNot bad!\c\nIt’s thrilling to dive into a field\nthat no one has noticed yet.\c\n[VAR ITEM2(0000)]-dexes will\ndefinitely be in great demand with Trainers.

Even if a Pokémon faints and can’t battle,\nit can still use HM moves.

OK, you’ve got me.\nTake this Gym Badge!
[VAR TRNAME(0000)] received the Knuckle Badge\nfrom Brawly.
The Knuckle Badge makes all Pokémon up to Level 30,\neven those you get in trades, obey without question.
Hmm... You know what?\nI think you can make full use of this, too.
I’m sure this will help your Pokémon bulk up muscle!
Bulk Up temporarily enhances the Pokémon’s\nmuscle power.\c\nThe move boosts both Attack and Defense stats of\nthe Pokémon.
I can see your talent becoming a giant wave that causes\na storm of astonishment with Trainers one day!\c\nI look forward to the day when I can surf your giant wave!
By the way, have you been to [VAR COLOR(0002)]Granite Cave[VAR COLOR(0000)]?\c\nIt’s located to the north of this town.\c\nIt’s full of fascinating stuff, like rare stones and wall\npaintings thousands of years old.\c\nMy friend [VAR COLOR(0002)]Steven[VAR COLOR(0000)] rushed to the cave after I told him\nabout it.

And this is a Pokémon Center!\nLook for a red roof!\c\nAsk a woman inside, and she’ll restore your\nPokémon’s health.\c\nThat’s it. That was the advice from me—\nthe supremely kindhearted clerk.\c\nHave a great journey!
I’d like you to have these as part of a\nspecial promotion!

Huh? You’re looking for Professor Birch?\c\nThe prof’s away on fieldwork. Ergo, not here.\c\nOh, I guess I have to tell you what fieldwork is?\c\nFieldwork is when you study things in their\nnatural environments, like out in the fields and\r\nmountains, instead of in a laboratory.\c\nThe prof isn’t one for doing desk work, really.\nHe’s the type who would rather go outside and\r\nexperience things than read about them here.\c\nHe’s probably doing a survey of [VAR COLOR(0002)]Route 101[VAR COLOR(0000)] now.\nIt’s just outside of the town.
The professor isn’t one for doing desk work.\nHe’s the type of person who would\r\nrather go outside and experience\r\nthings than read about them here.
Professor Birch is studying the habitats\nand distribution of Pokémon.\c\nThe professor enjoys May’s help, too.\nThere’s a lot of love there.

So, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\c\nI’ve heard so much about you from your father.\c\nBut he said that you don’t have your own Pokémon yet.\nIf that’s true, that was quite the performance back there!\c\nLooks like you really are your father’s son!

Oh, yes! To say thanks for rescuing me out there,\nhow about I give you that Pokémon you used earlier?
[VAR TRNAME(0000)] received [VAR PKNAME(0001)]!
While you’re at it, why not give a nickname to\nthat [VAR PKNAME(0001)]?
Yup! That’s the spirit!\nSo what kind of name will you go with?
Oh, so that’s how you like to do things?\nNot even going to give it a nickname, are you?
You know, if you work with your Pokémon and gain\nexperience, I think you’ll make a pretty excellent Trainer.\c\nMy girl, May, happens to be out on [VAR COLOR(0002)]Route 103[VAR COLOR(0000)] right\nnow, surveying Pokémon for me.\c\nIt might not be a bad idea for you to head out that\nway yourself. What do you think?

Great! I’m sure May’ll be happy to hear that, too.\nShe can help teach you what it means to be a Trainer.
Great! I’m sure Brendan’ll be happy to hear that, too.\nHe can help teach you what it means to be a Trainer.
Oh, don’t be that way!\nYou should go meet my kid.
Oh, yes!\c\nAnd if you’re ever lost along the way, use the [VAR COLOR(0002)]AreaNav[VAR COLOR(0000)]\non your [VAR COLOR(0002)]PokéNav Plus[VAR COLOR(0000)]!\c\nYou can use it to see how to get to [VAR COLOR(0002)]Route 103[VAR COLOR(0000)],\nwhere May ought to be.\c\nAnd if you or your Pokémon get tired, get some rest\nback at your new house.
...Oh, yes!\c\nAnd if you’re ever lost along the way, just use the\n[VAR COLOR(0002)]AreaNav[VAR COLOR(0000)] on your [VAR COLOR(0002)]PokéNav Plus[VAR COLOR(0000)]!\c\nYou can use it to see how to get to [VAR COLOR(0002)]Route 103[VAR COLOR(0000)],\nwhere Brendan should be.\c\nAnd if you or your Pokémon get tired, get some rest\nback at your new house.
Oh! [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\nOver here!
Oh! [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\nOver here!
So I hear you beat May on your first try. That’s amazing!\c\nMay’s been helping with my research for a long time, so\nshe has a pretty long history as a Trainer already.\c\nMm-hmm! I think that settles it!\c\n[VAR TRNAME(0000)], I ordered this Pokédex for my research,\nbut I think you should take it.

[VAR TRNAME(0000)] received a [VAR BD00(0007,0000,0000)]Pokédex[VAR BD01]!
That Pokédex is a high-tech tool that automatically\nmakes a record of any Pokémon you meet or catch.\c\nMy girl May takes hers with her everywhere she goes.\c\nWhenever she catches a rare Pokémon and records\nits data in the Pokédex, why, she comes to seek me\r\nout wherever I am in the field and show me!

[~ 25]
[~ 26]
The Pokémon and people you will meet...\nAnd the great expanse of nature that lies before you!\c\nExperience them both while you fill in your Pokédex.\nI’d love it if your world seemed wider than ever!\c\nThough I’d love it even more if you came back from\ntime to time to show me what progress you’ve made.\c\n...Arghhh!\nI’m getting the itch to get out and do fieldwork again!
Oh, wow, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]! Now you’ve got a\nPokédex, too!\r\nThat’s great. Just like me!\c\nThen here... I’ll give you something, too!\c\nSome Poké Balls that you can use to catch wild Pokémon!
If you catch a Pokémon in the wild and\nbattle together with it for a while,\r\nit will grow stronger for you!\c\nTake that as a bit of advice from a\nmore experienced Trainer like me!\c\nI’m going to get ready to head out\nfrom Littleroot soon myself.\c\nI can’t wait to see what kind of\nPokémon I’m going to meet...\c\nLet’s both do our best on our\njourneys, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!
[~ 30]
I wonder where I should go\nto look for Pokémon next?
Huh...\nSo you got a Pokédex, too, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].\c\nWell then here. Have some Poké Balls on me.\c\nYou can use them to catch wild Pokémon.

It really gets you\npumped up, right?\c\nWe’ve both gotta give it our all out\nthere, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!
[~ 34]
I wonder where I should go\nto look for Pokémon next...
It’s a serious-looking machine.\c\nA detailed list of Pokémon that inhabit\nthe Hoenn region is displayed on the map.
It’s a PC used for research.\c\nOn the monitor is an image\nof a never-before-seen Pokémon.\r\nBetter not mess around with it.
There are still some notes written in neat\nhandwriting in the notebook that’s been left wide open!\c\n“Could it be that several thousand years ago\nthe Pokémon population of the Hoenn region\r\nwas even more diverse?”
“The History of the Hoenn Region,”\n“The Ecosystem of Pokémon 3,000 Years Ago,”\r\n“The Pokémon of Kalos and Hoenn,”\r\n“The Coexistence of People and Pokémon,”\r\n“Distribution of Pokémon Species, National Edition.”\c\nThere are a lot books written by Professor Birch here!
Welcome back, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\nYou must be tired after all your recent exploits.\c\nMay has been keeping me updated about all of\nyour grand adventures around Hoenn.\c\nAfter hearing all that you’ve been up to, there is\nsomething I’d definitely like to share with you.
Welcome back, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\nYou must be tired after all your recent exploits.\c\nBrendan has been keeping me updated about all\nof your grand adventures around Hoenn.\c\nAfter hearing all that you’ve been up to, there is\nsomething I’d definitely like to share with you.
The fact of the matter is that after you resolved\nthat kerfuffle with the super-ancient Pokémon,\r\na number of Pokémon never before recorded in\r\nthe Hoenn region began to appear all over!\c\nThose Pokémon are precisely the subject of my\nmany long years of research...\c\nThey are Pokémon which are thought to have\nresided in Hoenn thousands of years ago!
We’ll finally be able to meet Pokémon never before seen,\nthe very Pokémon I’ve pursued all these years!\r\nI’m so excited I feel like I’m about to burst!\c\nSo excited that I went right ahead and upgraded the\nPokédex to be ready for all of them!
Now, let me upgrade your\nPokédex while you’re here!
The National Pokédex has now been added to\n[VAR TRNAME(0000)]’s Pokédex!
You’ll now find the National Pokédex on\nyour Pokédex’s menu, so use it well!
It is being suggested that Hoenn is\nnow more hospitable to Pokémon\r\nafter that incident in Sootopolis.\c\nHowever, that does not necessarily\nmean the environment has become\r\nany more hospitable to humanity.\c\nPeople, Pokémon, and nature...\c\nThe balance between these three\ngreat ecosystems has shifted greatly.\r\nI can’t wait for you to start exploring this new world!\c\nExploration may help us learn how best to\ncoexist with Pokémon from this time forward.\c\nI hope you will find your own answers\nto this great question, as you continue\r\nyour journey with your Pokédex!

[VAR TRNAME(0000)]! You’re here at last!\c\nWasn’t it tough riding in the back of\nthe bumpy moving truck all that way?\c\nWell, this is Littleroot Town.\c\nWhat do you think?\nThis is going to be our new home!\c\nIt has a quaint feel, but it looks like it should\nbe a nice place to live, don’t you think?\c\nAnd you get your own room this time,\n[VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\c\nCome on. You have to see the inside!
[VAR TRNAME(0000)]! Wait!
[VAR TRNAME(0000)]! [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\nDid you introduce yourself to Professor Birch?\c\nOh! What an adorable Pokémon!\nYou got it from the professor? How nice!\c\nYou are your father’s child, all right...\nYou look good together with a Pokémon!
[~ 3]
[~ 4]
...\c\nTo think that you have your very own\nPokémon now...\r\nYour father will be overjoyed.\c\nBut don’t push yourself too hard.\c\nIf anything happens, you can always\ncome home, honey.
To think that you can get data from\nthe friends you pass by even when\r\nyour Nintendo 3DS is in Sleep Mode!\c\nThe power of science is staggering!
Professor Birch will spend days on end in his lab\nresearching something, then he’ll suddenly go out\r\ninto the field to gather more data...\c\nWhen does he ever spend time at home?
If you step into the tall grass on the route up\nahead, wild Pokémon will jump out at you!
It’s not safe to go out there if you\ndon’t have any Pokémon with you.
I think I hear someone screaming up ahead!\c\nWhat should I do? What should we do?\nSomebody has to go help...
Boy, am I glad there was an intrepid guy\nlike you around to rescue the professor.

Huh?
Whoa! Are we in sync or what!\c\nYou know, I was just thinking about you!
It’s great to meet you!\c\n...It is our first real meeting, right?\nYeah. That’s right. Of course it is!
The name’s Zinnia.\nAnd you...\c\nWell, I know ALL about you.\nYou’re [VAR TRNAME(0000)], of course.
You’re the new Pokémon League Champion!\c\nAnd you’re one of those special few who use\nMega Evolution to get even closer to their\r\nPokémon... Now, aren’t you?
Mrrr...
OK, I know, I know.\c\nI’ll leave it alone.\c\nLook, I’m stopping!
But this sure is a ni-i-i-ice place, isn’t it? Littleroot Town.\c\nAnd everybody living here is just so ni-i-i-ice, too.\c\nLike that neighbor of yours.
...Oops! So-o-o-rry.\nI didn’t mean to go on like that.\c\nWe should keep our first meeting short and sweet,\ndon’t you think?\c\nUntil next time, then. Buh-bye!
Well... Bye then...
Well... Bye...

I’m known as the Day Care Man.\c\nI help take care of the precious\nPokémon of Trainers like you.\c\nIf you’d like us to raise a Pokémon\nfor you, have a word with my wife.
Why, you again! Good to see you back.\nYour [VAR PKNAME(0000)]’s doing fine.
Good to see you back!\c\nYour [VAR PKNICK(0000)] and your [VAR PKNICK(0001)]\nare doing just fine.\c\nThose two seem to get along\nlike a house on fire.
Good to see you back!\c\nYour [VAR PKNICK(0000)] and your [VAR PKNICK(0001)]\nare doing just fine.\c\nThose two seem peaceable\nenough toward each other.
Good to see you back!\c\nYour [VAR PKNICK(0000)] and your [VAR PKNICK(0001)]\nare doing just fine.\c\nBut I have to say, those two don’t seem\nto like each other all that much.
Good to see you back!\c\nYour [VAR PKNICK(0000)] and your [VAR PKNICK(0001)]\nare doing just fine.\c\nThose two would really rather play with other\nPokémon, though, and not each other.
Ah! You’re back!\c\nWe were raising your Pokémon and,\nme oh my, were we surprised!\c\nWhile we were caring for it, your\nPokémon somehow found an Egg!\c\nDon’t know where it might’ve come from,\nbut your Pokémon ended up with it.\c\nYou’ll be wanting it, won’t you?
[VAR TRNAME(0000)] received the Egg from the Day Care Man.
Be sure you take good care of it!
You’ve got no room for an Egg now...\nCome back when you’ve made some space.
I’ll take it off your hands, then.\nBe honest—you do want it, don’t you?
Well then, I’ll be having this one!\nThanks!
I’m the Day Care Lady, dearie.\c\nWe can raise your Pokémon for you\nhere at our Pokémon Day Care.\c\nWould you like us to raise one?
I’m the Day Care Lady.\c\nWe can raise your Pokémon for you\nhere at our Pokémon Day Care.\c\nWhat can we do you for today?
Righty-oh. Come again.
My husband was looking for you, you know.
If you leave me that Pokémon,\nwhat will you battle with?\c\nCome back when you have\nmore of a team.
Which Pokémon shall we raise for you?
Oh...\nThat is naught but an Egg!
Righty-oh.\nWe’ll raise your [VAR PKNAME(0000)] for a while.
Come back for it later, though.
We can take up to two of your Pokémon.\nWould you like us to raise one more?
Oh, so you’ve come again!\nYou have mighty spirited Pokémon, you know.\r\nAre you here to take one back?
Well, we’ve raised your [VAR PKNAME(0000)] up by\nabout [VAR NUM2(0001)] level[VAR NUMBRNCH(0001,0100)]s.
If you’ll be wanting your [VAR PKNAME(0000)] back now,\nit will cost you $[VAR NUM5(0001,002C)].
Oopsie! It looks as though your\npurse is a little light at the moment...
[VAR TRNAME(0001)] took back h[VAR GENDBR(00FF,0202)]iser [VAR PKNAME(0000)]\nfrom the Day Care Lady.
You wanna take the other one back, too?
Oh me...\c\nIf you leave a Pokémon with me,\nyou’ll be left with only the one.\c\nYou’d better go catch some more\nbefore you try such a thing.
Oh me, your Pokémon team is full up!\nMake room, and then come see me again.

Would you like to give a nickname to the newly\nhatched [VAR PKNAME(0000)]?
Hi, I’m the Day Care Lad!\c\nIt’s my job to help take care of other\nTrainers’ precious Pokémon.\c\nIf you want us to raise your Pokémon,\nplease go inside and talk to my big sister.
Hi there!\n[VAR PKNICK(0000)]’s doing just fine!
Hi there!\c\nYour [VAR PKNICK(0000)] and\n[VAR PKNICK(0001)] are doing just fine.\c\nThey really seem to like hanging out!
Hi there!\c\nYour [VAR PKNICK(0000)] and\n[VAR PKNICK(0001)] are doing just fine.\c\nThe two seem to get along all right.
Hi there!\c\nYour [VAR PKNICK(0000)] and\n[VAR PKNICK(0001)] are doing just fine.\c\nBut they don’t seem to like each\nother very much...
Hi there!\c\nYour [VAR PKNICK(0000)] and\n[VAR PKNICK(0001)] are doing just fine.\c\nSeems they’d rather play with other Pokémon—\nnot so much with each other.
Oh hey!\c\nWhen we were raising your Pokémon,\nsomething amazing happened!\c\nIt somehow ended up holding an Egg!\c\nI have no idea where it came from.\nIt’s like a total mystery!\c\nYou’ve gotta want it, right?
[VAR TRNAME(0000)] received the Egg from the Day Care Lad.
There you go! Take good care of it!
Ah! You’ve got a whole team already!\nThere’s no space for this Egg now.\c\nWhy don’t you deposit one of your\nPokémon in the PC to make space?
If you don’t want it, I’ll keep it!\nBut you’ve gotta want it, right?
Really really? Well...\nI’ll keep it, then! Thanks!
Welcome to the Pokémon Day Care.\nWe’re happy to raise your Pokémon here!\c\nWould you like to entrust us with your Pokémon?
Welcome to the Pokémon Day Care.\nWe’re happy to raise your Pokémon here!\c\nHow can we help you today?
Come again, then!
My little brother has been looking for you!\nHe’s probably out front. Go see him!
If you let me take that Pokémon now,\nyou’ll have no one left to battle with!\c\nI just can’t let you do that!
Which Pokémon should we raise for you?
I’m so sorry, but we aren’t\nset up to raise Eggs here...
Got it! We’ll raise your\n[VAR PKNAME(0000)] for a while.
You can come and pick it up anytime!
We can take up to two Pokémon per Trainer.\nWould you like us to raise another?
We’ve had a great time with your Pokémon,\nbut are you here to make a pickup?
Your [VAR PKNAME(0000)] has grown by\n[VAR NUM2(0001)] level[VAR NUMBRNCH(0000,0100)]s during its stay with us.
If you’re going to collect your [VAR PKNAME(0000)] now,\nyou will owe us $[VAR NUM5(0001,002C)]. Is that OK?
Oh, you don’t have that much money...
[VAR TRNAME(0001)] took [VAR PKNAME(0000)]\nback from the Pokémon Day Care.
Do you want to collect your\nother Pokémon now, too?
Oh! If you leave a Pokémon with\nme, you’ll be left with only one!\c\nI just can’t let you do that!
Your team is all full, so I can’t\nreturn your Pokémon to you.\c\nYou could drop one off in a\nPC Box to make space.

Mmm-mm. I can smell it.\nI can smell it right here...\r\nThe scent of adventure!\c\nThis is definitely one.\nIt’s gotta be a [VAR COLOR(0002)]Secret Spot[VAR COLOR(0000)].\c\nThere’ll be enough space here\nto build a crazy super place,\r\nor my name’s not Aarune!
Yo, my young Pokémon Trainer!\nWhat can I do you for, hmm?\c\nHuh?\c\nWhat d’you mean, you didn’t ask\nfor anything? Bet your heart did!\c\nNow, now, no need to be shy!\nAfter all, we managed to meet!\c\nThe name’s Aarune. Put’er there.\c\nUnova-born, and twenty-five years old.\nSpent the last 11 years trying to find myself.\r\nJust a vagabond in search of dreams.\c\nI’m wandering ’round Hoenn, trying to\nfind a place where I really belong.\r\nThat’s right! A [VAR COLOR(0002)]Super-Secret Base[VAR COLOR(0000)]!
You don’t know about Secret Bases?\c\nWhat kinda life is that? Too sad, little [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0303)]brosis.\nTime for a little lecture from Uncle Aarune!\c\nLet’s start with what a Secret Base is...\nWhich is adventure! Romance! Awesome!\c\nFor real, it’s the best place ever to chill—\nyou, your pals that you let hang out...\c\nSince you’ve got this chance, you oughta\nlearn how to make one. Take this.
[VAR COLOR(0002)]Secret Power [VAR COLOR(0000)]can help you find\nthe entrances to hidden places.\c\nThese entrances...\c\nThey’re full of adventure, all right!\c\nThat’s why I like to throw some spice\nin there and call ’em [VAR COLOR(0002)]Secret Spots[VAR COLOR(0000)]!
Like this! See?\nThis right here is a Secret Spot.\c\nDoesn’t it look like you could just\nclimb right up in this tree?\c\nThis is exactly the kinda place\nto bust out with Secret Power!
Awww yeah!\nI never get tired of that!\c\nAnd that’s all there is to finding\nSecret Spots and creating the\r\nentrance to a Secret Base.\c\nThis move is crucial to having a\nSecret Base. Don’t forget, now!
Mm-hmm! Not a bad layout...\c\nSee, behind each Secret Spot,\nyou’ll find a space like this.\c\nThey come in all kindsa shapes\nand sizes.\c\nSo basically, whenever you find a\nSecret Spot, you oughta at least\r\ncheck it out with Secret Power!
Just think... Someday this place could be\nsomebody’s Secret Base, all decorated\r\nand filled with goods and friends...\r\nI’d really love to see it like that.
Wait a sec...\c\nBut who in the world are you?\c\n...\c\nAhhh! Right! [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\nSorry about that. I just got on such a roll...\c\nSo then, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\nHow about I give you one more tip?\c\nWhen you feel happy about something,\nyou oughta express that feeling.\r\nPut it into words! It’ll cheer everybody up.
So how ’bout you tell me, huh?\c\nC’mon. Tell Uncle Aarune what you\nsay when you’re totally thrilled!
Whistle...\n[VAR 01A9(0001)]? That’s good!\c\nKnow why I asked you that? Isn’t it obvious?\c\nIt’s ’cause I can see already that there’s\nplenty in your future to feel happy about!
That’s just how we roll in the Secret Base life.\nEvery day is full of happy adventures! Aw yeah!
Hmm. Now I could go ahead and make\na Secret Base right here, but...\c\nI get the feeling that this layout could\nbe even better for you, little [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0303)]brosis!\c\nGuess I’m gonna leave this spot for you!
Oh, right. [VAR COLOR(0002)]Decorating[VAR COLOR(0000)]!\c\nSee, any Decorations you get will be sent to\nthe PC in your Secret Base automatically.\r\nPlace ’em around and liven up your base a bit.
That there’s a PC!\c\nThat’s where you’ll find your Decorations.\c\nNot that you probably have much, right?\nHere, I’ll give you these to get ya started!
Oh, RIGHT! One last thing!\c\nYou can do more than make your own\nSecret Base. You can visit other\r\npeople’s bases for a bit of fun.\c\nIf you find a base that belongs to\nsomeone else, check it out.\c\nAnd here’s the real point. When you\ncheck out someone’s base, collect the\r\nflag you find next to the PC. Heh heh...\r\nSomething good might come of it!
Looks like it’s about time for me to hit\nthe road in search of my perfect base!\c\nGood-bye for now, but hopefully\nI’ll see you again, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].\c\nIf you need me for anything, try dropping\nin at the [VAR COLOR(0002)]Secret Base Guild[VAR COLOR(0000)] in [VAR COLOR(0002)]Fortree[VAR COLOR(0000)]!
This will be your Secret Base\nfrom now on, little pal!\c\nIt’s yours now, so decorate it,\ndestroy it, do whatever you want!\c\nWhatever floats your boat, right?
[VAR TRNAME(0000)] received Decorations from Aarune!\c\n[VAR TRNAME(0000)] sent them off to h[VAR GENDBR(00FF,0202)]iser Secret PC!

[VAR TRNAME(0000)]: Sounds good!\nWhich Egg should I stroke?
[VAR TRNAME(0000)]: I don’t see any Eggs here...

Oh! A customer!\nWelcome to the Inverse Battle Stop!
What I have to offer here at the Inverse Battle Stop\nis a positively miraculous form of Pokémon battle!\c\nThat’s right... I call it the Inverse Battle!\c\nThis precision machine, this envisioned contraption\ncan use its inversion powers to temporarily invert\r\nall type matchups between Pokémon!\c\nIt’s the Inverse-o-matic!\c\nSuper effective becomes not very effective!\nNot very effective becomes super effective!\c\nHow about that! You have to admit that it sounds\npretty fantastically fun, don’t you? Don’t you?\c\nYou might think you’ve got your head wrapped\naround it, but when you’re actually in the thick\r\nof it, it’s surprisingly tough! So how about it?
If you’ve come to visit my humble storefront,\nthen you must be ready for an Inverse Battle!
Super effective becomes not very effective!\nNot very effective becomes super effective!
You came all this way...to turn back now?\nBut I’ll be waiting for your return!
Oh, yes! Oh, just as I would expect!\c\nYou are a true habitué of the Inverse\nBattle Stop!\c\nI’ve got a little gift for such a great\nregular. Here! Take it!
Oh, yes! Oh, just as I would expect!\c\nYou are a true habitué of the Inverse\nBattle Stop!\c\nI’ve got a little gift for such a great\nregular. In fact, I’ve got three!

Ohhh! Excellent! Just excellent!\c\nYou have perfectly understood\nthe beauty of the Inverse Battle!\c\nI’ve got a little something—three\nlittle somethings, in fact—for you!

Nice job!\c\nThough I think that you haven’t quite\ngrasped the trick of Inverse Battling.\c\nStill, I’ll give you a little something,\nso be sure to come try again!
Nice job!\c\nThough I think that you haven’t quite\ngrasped the trick of Inverse Battling.\c\nStill, I’ll give you these, so be sure to\ncome try again sometime!
My fantastic Inverse-o-matic is indeed a revolutionary\ndevice that can temporarily invert all type matchups.\c\nBut I can’t just fire it up again and again, you know.\nDo you think you could come back tomorrow?

Hullo, hullo, and welcome.\nI hope you meet lots of Pokémon!
As you explore, you may see some litter here\nand there. Sometimes you can spot Poké Balls\r\nthat have been lying around for years.\c\nNo one has ever come to claim them, and\nwe’d collect them for recycling anyway,\r\nso feel free to pick them for your own use.

There are both rare Pokémon and common\nPokémon to be found here, but I hope\r\nyou’ll love them both the same. OK?
I’m in charge of keeping the\nPokémon well fed around here.\c\nI dole out a set amount at a\nset time every day.

It’s my job to go about checking up\non the health of all the Pokémon.\c\nHaving so many Pokémon together\nin one area means we have to be\r\nextra careful of the spread of illness.
You know, we call this place the Safari Zone,\nbut it’s really no different than any wild area.\c\nThere are no cages or walls. The Pokémon\nare free to come and go as they like.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Are you catching Pokémon\nhere in the Safari Zone?\c\nThat’s fine as long as you\ntake care of them!
We’re all volunteers around here.\c\nThat’s what you’ve got to do when\nyou don’t charge for admission!

A mysterious ring is floating in the air.\nSomething is visible deep in the hole...
Would you like to put your hand deep in the hole?
A mysterious ring is floating in the air...

Very clear sea water is quietly surging...
A blazing and strong presence is in the air...
You feel an intense gaze almost electrifying\nyour entire body...
Cold air like the north wind sweeps over the area...
Fresh air surrounds the area.\nIt’s clearing your head...
Clear air surrounds the area,\nmaking you feel strong.
Clear air surrounds the area.\nIt’s lifting your spirits...
The area is filled with a calm atmosphere.
It’s so hot that you can’t stop sweating...\nMerely breathing is difficult...
The area is filled with electrifying pressure...
The area is filled with blazing pressure...
The area is filled with freezing pressure...
You feel a piercing gaze sizing you up...
You feel a strong gaze and like something\nis calling for you...
You feel a quiet gaze...testing you...

As you can see, I have undone the seal on the entrance\nto the Sky Pillar.\c\nFollow the path within, and you will reach the pillar\nin time.
However...\c\nTo go beyond this point...\c\nThere is one more trial you must overcome.
This is my duty as one of the ancient Sootopolitans,\na duty passed down to me by my former master.
You must battle me.\nHere and now.\c\nProve to me that your power is great enough\nto face what lies ahead!
Now tell me...\nAre you prepared?
I see. I will wait.\nPrepare yourself.
Then let us begin...\c\nChampion of Hoenn.\c\nYou, who should exhibit the most graceful of art in\nbattle with your Pokémon...\c\nI would have you show me your true strength!
As I have come to expect from you,\n[VAR TRNAME(0000)]...\c\nYou are an excellent Pokémon Trainer.

Now go forth.\c\nFind the truth that you seek.
As one of the ancient people of Sootopolis,\nI cannot intrude upon this holy place.\c\nI will return to Sootopolis for now and try\nto lay plans in case the worst should come\r\nto pass despite all our efforts.\c\nI’m sorry that we always seem to be leaving\nthe fate of all the world in your hands.\c\nYet there it lies once again.\nGood luck to you, young Champion!

Is this...\nIs this the power of the super-ancient Pokémon?\c\nIs this what Kyogre’s power truly is?\nIs this how you return everything to its beginning?
The balance in this world is faltering.\nAt this rate, it may be lost forever.
You...\c\nWe will make our way to Sootopolis.\c\nIt is most likely the case that Kyogre\nis also making its way to that city.
In the deepest reaches of the Cave of Origin,\nwhich lies in the heart of Sootopolis City...
That is where Kyogre will find the energy\nit needs to reclaim its primal form.
I expect Kyogre will go to that place\nin search of even greater power.\c\nWe must follow it to the Cave of Origin\nand do whatever it takes!\c\nThere’s nothing else we can do!
Archie.\c\nYou and your team of fools\nwill accompany us.
We have brought this calamity upon ourselves.\nIt is only right that we take responsibility\r\nand clean up after our mistakes.
Ugh!

OK, little scamp...\c\nWe’re setting sail for Sootopolis.\c\nThat blasted Groudon is no doubt\ngonna get there ahead of us.
It’ll be waiting for us deep in the\nCave of Origin, there in Sootopolis...
There’s a pool of energy there that\nfolks say is needful for Primal Reversion.
There’s no doubt in my mind that\nGroudon will be racing to that cave,\r\nthirsting for that power...\c\nWe got no choice but to go ourselves.\nWe gotta do whatever we can to fight back!
All right, Maxie!\c\nYou Team Magma blighters\nbetter come with us.
We’re responsible for this mess.\nThis ridiculous, impossible mess.\c\nIt only makes sense for us all to\nstep up and clean up after ourselves.\r\nAgreed?

Hello, and welcome to the Safari Zone!\nAdmittance is free! Catch all the Pokémon you can!\c\nEnjoy yourself with Pokémon for as long as time allows!
I met this little rascal here,\nand now we’re just like family!
Guhbeh!
Are you going to the Safari Zone?\c\nThen you’d better take either\nan Acro Bike or a Mach Bike!
There’s a book called “The Path of the Safari Zone.”\nIt looks long, but do you want to read it?
Chapter One: Foundation.\c\n“A desire to provide the children of the Hoenn region\nwith a chance to encounter many Pokémon welled\r\nup inside of me and led to my\r\ndecision to open here.”\c\nChapter Two: Opening.\c\n“From the very day we opened, a long line wound\nits way from the Safari Zone. It was a huge success.\c\nA desire to make more money off of it welled up\ninside of me and led to my decision\r\nto raise the price of admission.”
Chapter Three: Bankruptcy.\c\n“As a result of the higher admission prices,\ncustomers stopped coming to the Safari Zone.\c\nA desire to save my own hide welled up inside of me\nand led to my decision to flee under cover of night.”\c\nChapter Four: Rebirth.\c\n“After I had made my escape, the Safari Zone was reborn\nthanks to the support of some thoughtful people.\c\nA desire to pretend that I had never run away welled up\ninside of me and led to my decision to return to Hoenn.”\c\nFinal Chapter: The Future.\c\n“Having made my return,\nI began working as a volunteer at the Safari Zone.\c\nA desire to express my happiness at having returned\nwelled up inside of me and led to my decision\r\nto continue to take good care of Pokémon every day.”
That look in your eyes...\c\nAnd the aura floating about you...\nYou’re one of my kind, aren’t you?\c\nYou make all kinds of mischief, right?\nIf so, you’ll really like this!
Maybe it’s ’cause I was so naughty in the past,\nbut lately I don’t feel refreshed when I wake up.\c\nThen I taught this to my Pokémon,\nand now all my bad dreams get eaten up!

I heard that somewhere there’s a\ncave called the Cave of Origin.\c\nThey say that the spirits of\nPokémon are revived there.\r\nCould something like that really happen?
Peee-hyoh?
Look at you!\nYou must be tired.\c\nWhy don’t you and your Pokémon\ntake a rest here?
Look at you!\nYou and your Pokémon so full of energy and all!
Look at you!\nI can tell you’ve recovered fully!\c\nWhat are you waiting for?\nGo on with your Pokémon!

Just...what...\nis this...\c\nD-d-did Leader Maxie know\nthat it would happen like this?!
Could it be?\c\nIs this the world...\nArchie hoped to create...
Curse you!\nThe precious results of my research!\c\nGIVE THEM BACK!!!
Oh, shut it!
Shut your mouth!
Augh?!
Steady on! Are you all right?!
Just what is going on around here?!\c\nAhyahya!\nEven I, Tabitha, am feeling\r\nall discombobulated.\c\nLeader Maxie!\c\nWhat are you trying to do?!\n...To the world.\r\n...To us. ...To Team Magma.\c\nThis can never, ever be forgiven!
Fine, I’ll give it back.\nI’ll give it back, all right?\c\nThe awakening of the super-ancient Pokémon\nwill bring about extreme weather.\c\nIf this happened all over the world, what would\nbecome of Pokémon, not to mention people?
Ahya.\c\nAre you one of my fans?\nYou’re that same kid who’s always popping up!\c\nI can’t believe you’re even following\nme around in my private life.
Oh my!\c\nI even run into you when\nI’m not on the clock!\c\nI wonder why that is...\nMaybe we’re destined to be together... Ahaha!
Ahyahya!\nWell, that’s all right!\c\nMaybe I’ll just clear up this intensely unpleasant\nfeeling I have welling up inside of me...\r\nBy beating you to a pulp!
Wanna know something?\c\nI’m feeling so empty and downhearted\nright now. I can’t get my head straight.\c\nUmm?\nHelp me take my mind off it.\c\nThe way you and your Pokémon battle so\nstraightforwardly and sincerely with such hope,\r\nit makes me so mad!
Hah... Hah...\nAhya... Ahya...
...
Good grief... Today has been\nabsolutely nothing but stress!\r\nI can’t take it... It’s so unpleasant!
Hmmph.\c\nI feel a bit more relaxed...\nThanks.
You better listen, you stress-inducing child.\c\nWhen Leader Maxie’s plan has been\nexecuted, twilight will fall upon the world.\c\nThe Primordial Sea will be changed to Desolate Land.\nIn other words, all life...\r\nChild!\c\nWhat do you think you can do in the\nface of that which is to come?
As a token of my gratitude, I’ll tell you\none thing.\c\nWhen Team Aqua’s...\nNo, when the illustrious Archie’s ambitions\r\nhave been realized, the world will truly\r\nreturn to its beginnings, to before the\r\nbirth of anything at all...\c\nThink for yourself about what to do\nwhen you’re up against that reality.\c\nI still haven’t figured out for myself\nwhat’s wrong and what’s right...
I’m looking forward to\nseeing you rush into action!\r\nAhya! Ahyahyahyahya!
See ya.\nI’m sure I’ll run into you again, though.
The Leader should be headed for [VAR COLOR(0002)]Mt. Pyre[VAR COLOR(0000)]...\nWhich means I...
Archie is probably on the way to [VAR COLOR(0002)]Mt. Pyre[VAR COLOR(0000)]...\nSo I...
Thank you, young one.\nYou helped save us from quite a pinch!
You OK there, mate?
Hah... Hah...\nThat truly was a slap in the face...
Those thieves...\c\nWhat could they hope to gain by\ninvestigating the extreme weather\r\npatterns of thousands of years ago?
Oh, but I am forgetting myself!\nFirst I must thank you properly for your help.
It might seem an odd way of rewarding you,\nbut please take this Pokémon as my thanks.
Hmm? You cannot carry any more\nPokémon with you currently.\c\nWhy don’t you come to call again\nafter you’ve made space on your team?
[VAR TRNAME(0000)] received Castform!
Castform is a Pokémon that changes its form\naccording to the current weather conditions.
We have many of them living\nhere in the Institute with us.\c\nThey help us with our research\nof weather phenomena.
Indeed.\c\nI trust that it might help\nyou on your adventure.
But as for the data those ruffians were seeking...\c\nThey wanted to know about the extreme weather\nconditions that ruled thousands of years ago\r\nbecause of those two super-ancient Pokémon.
One of that pair was the Legendary Pokémon we know\nas mighty Kyogre...\c\nBy absorbing the energy that abounds in the natural\nworld, Kyogre transformed itself—or so it is said.\c\nThe transformed Kyogre caused so much disturbance\nto the weather patterns that the world was assaulted\r\nby torrential rains, and the seas rose around the planet.\c\nWe refer to this transformation as [VAR COLOR(0001)]Primal Reversion[VAR COLOR(0000)]...\c\nIts result is the terror we call [VAR COLOR(0001)]Primal Kyogre[VAR COLOR(0000)].\c\nPrimal Reversion is a possible form of Evolution,\nlike and yet not like Mega Evolution...\c\nOr so it has been theorized.\nBut it has never been achieved by any Pokémon other\r\nthan the super-ancient Legendary Pokémon, and so it\r\nhas been largely forgotten as a method of Evolution.
One of that pair was the Legendary Pokémon we know\nas mighty Groudon...\c\nBy absorbing the energy that abounds in the natural\nworld, Groudon transformed itself—or so it is said.\c\nThe transformed Groudon caused so much disturbance\nto the weather patterns that the world grew barren.\c\nThe heat it created dried up the oceans, and the\nparched land covered more and more of the planet.\c\nWe refer to this transformation as [VAR COLOR(0001)]Primal Reversion[VAR COLOR(0000)]...\c\nThe result of it is the terror we call [VAR COLOR(0001)]Primal Groudon[VAR COLOR(0000)].\c\nPrimal Reversion is a possible form of Evolution,\nlike and yet not like Mega Evolution...\c\nOr so it has been theorized.\nBut it has never been achieved by any Pokémon other\r\nthan the super-ancient Legendary Pokémon, and so it\r\nhas been largely forgotten as a method of Evolution.
If you’ll excuse us then...\c\nWe’ll be heading downstairs now, but talk to us when\nyou have a moment. We want to thank you as well.
I’ve been researching rain for many\nyears, but it’s ridiculous to think that\r\nhumans can freely change the weather.
I would still like to thank you somehow for your help.\nI hope you’ll take this Pokémon for your team.
We have many Castform living\nhere in the Institute with us.\c\nThey help us with our research\nof weather phenomena.

There are a number of documents\nexplaining meteorological studies.
It is a document detailing the extreme weather patterns\nbrought about by the super-ancient Pokémon, Kyogre.\c\n“By absorbing the abundant energy of the natural\nworld, Kyogre transformed itself and summoned forth\r\ngreater storm clouds than ever before witnessed.”\c\n“An endless deluge of rain fell from the storm clouds,\nprompting floods so terrible that it seemed the entire\r\nworld would sink beneath the seas.”\c\n“This transformative process, known as [VAR COLOR(0001)]Primal Reversion[VAR COLOR(0000)],\nturns Kyogre into the fearsome [VAR COLOR(0001)]Primal Kyogre[VAR COLOR(0000)].”
It is a document detailing the extreme weather patterns\nbrought about by the super-ancient Pokémon, Groudon.\c\n“By absorbing the abundant energy of the natural world,\nGroudon transformed itself. In its transformed state,\r\nit expelled waves of heat into the heavens above.”\c\n“This heat wave burned as brightly as another sun,\nprompting droughts so terrible that it seemed the\r\nentire world would be left shriveled and barren.”\c\n“This transformative process, known as [VAR COLOR(0001)]Primal Reversion[VAR COLOR(0000)],\nturns Groudon into the fearsome [VAR COLOR(0001)]Primal Groudon[VAR COLOR(0000)].”

Tch... It’s no good...\c\nWhen I ride a Bike in the tall grass,\nnobody can see my coolness.
Can your Pokémon use the move\nSecret Power to make a Secret Base\r\nout of a big pile of grass?
Do you use Detector Mode\nin the DexNav?\c\nApparently, the more you encounter\nthe same Pokémon, the better\r\nthe search function will be!\c\nIts accurate search capability\nallows you to find rare Pokémon.\c\nThey say you can find Pokémon\nwith strange moves or rare Abilities.

[VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\c\nGosh, where have you been hiding?\nI’ve been looking all over for you!
Oh...\nWhere did you get that thing on your wrist?\r\nThat’s a pretty fancy-looking bracelet...
...\c\nWow! So that’s a Mega Bracelet?\nAnd you can use it for Mega Evolution...\c\nI guess now you can keep getting even\ncloser to your Pokémon, huh?\r\nSome guys have all the luck...
But I’m not about to lose to\nyou and some accessory!\r\nLet’s see who’s best in battle!
Are your Pokémon all ready?\nOf course they are! Let’s go!
[~ 5]
Hm! Well, you did battle me like I\nasked, so I’ll give you a reward.
If you use Fly, your Pokémon will carry you back\nto anywhere you’ve been before.\c\nBut you must have the Gym Badge from\nFortree City to use Fly outside of battle.\r\nThat’s the most important bit, so don’t forget!
Maybe you should Fly home\nand visit Littleroot sometimes.\c\nI bet your mom worries about\nyou, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]...
Well, till we meet again!\nAnd next time I won’t lose!
[VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\nYou’ve been looking for Pokémon here?
Huh?\c\nThat bracelet you’ve got on...\nIt’s like, I don’t know, really cool...
...\c\nWhoa. So that’s the Mega Bracelet?\nAnd you can use it for Mega Evolution...\c\nSo you’ll just keep getting closer to your\nPokémon and getting even stronger...
All right, then. I guess I’ve\njust gotta help you test how\r\nstrong you’ve become, huh?\c\nShow me in battle how much\nbetter you’ve gotten!
Come on! A battle!\nI’m challenging you to a battle!
[~ 15]
I’d say you’re good enough to search\nfor Pokémon anywhere by now.\c\nHere, I’ll give you this, so try it out.\nYou should be able to use it fine.
With Fly, your Pokémon can carry you\nback to just about anyplace you’ve visited before.\c\nOf course, you’ll need the Fortree Gym Badge\nfirst, though...
Well, I’m going on ahead.\nBut I’m definitely winning next time!
We’re standing lookout here.\c\nHey, you! Stay away from the\nWeather Institute. It’s not safe.
Lookout duty is surprisingly boring.\c\nHey, you! Please don’t go near the\nWeather Institute!

Trainer Tips\c\nIf you get stuck in a Secret Base, use an Escape Rope,\nand you can be out of your pickle in no time!
I feel like I’m gonna be stuck here\nstanding lookout my whole life...
We’re even forced to stand lookout while\nthe Admins are off having private time!
Nice jump!\c\nSo you can do that kind\nof stuff with a Bike, too.
I always use my Pokémon to fly around,\nbut riding a Bike looks like fun, too!\r\nMaybe I should get one for myself.
There’s an invisible obstacle in your way.
Would you like to use the Devon Scope?
[VAR TRNAME(0000)] slipped the Devon Scope on.
A previously invisible Pokémon became visible to\nthe naked eye!
The startled Pokémon attacked!

We met in Granite Cave, didn’t we?
No, I remember it.\nIt’s [VAR TRNAME(0000)]...\r\nRight?\c\nIt’s good to see that your\njourney is going well.
No, I remember it.\nIt’s [VAR TRNAME(0000)]...\r\nRight?\c\nIt’s good to see that your\njourney is going well.
You know, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]...
You know, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]...
In this vast world, there are many kinds\nof Pokémon.\r\nThey come in many types.
Should you raise different types?\nOr will you only raise Pokémon of a certain type\r\nyou like?
I wonder what you think, as a Pokémon Trainer?
Not that it’s anything I should be concerning\nmyself with...\c\nBut somehow I find myself wanting to know what\nyou think.
I suppose I should be going.\nI hope to see you again though.
...Hm?

Latios!
Hyaahh!

Latias...\nI believe that it sought us out for help.
Latios...\nI believe that it sought us out for help.
If that’s the case, let’s go!
So we’ve come back here...\c\nWhen you’re ready to return to\nSouthern Island, come tell me.
Are your preparations complete?
I see.\nI’ll be waiting here.
Thank you for your help, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].
Thank you for your help, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].
Hyan!
Shwan!
Perhaps it’s trying to tell you\nto take good care of Latios.
Perhaps it’s trying to tell you\nto take good care of Latias.
Hyaahhn!
Shwaahhn!
In the end, you were a far greater help than I\nexpected you might be.
I expect that you and your team will be able to best both\nRoute 119 ahead and even the Fortree Gym beyond that.
I’ll be curious to see how much stronger you might\ngrow by the next time we meet.
Until then, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].
Until then, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].
Where are you going?\nI don’t think we can walk away from this.
Hyaahh!
Shwaahh!
Hmm!\nA Good Rod is really good!\c\nWouldn’t you agree?
Hmm!\nWe’re of identical minds!\c\nHmm!\nTake this Good Rod!
Wherever there’s water, try your luck\nat fishing.
Don’t you like to fish?
Try catching all sorts of Pokémon\nwith your Good Rod.
Even if there isn’t a boat, you can\ncross rivers and the sea if you have\r\na Pokémon that knows Surf.\c\nPokémon can be counted on to do\nso much!

Thanks to that Aarune dude, I’ve been awakened\nto the adventure that is building a Secret Base.\c\nHe said he would be waiting for me with the\nSecret Base Guild, but Fortree City is far away.
Hmm...but...\nI’m not sure what it is, but...\r\nBut I just have this feeling...
My intuition has often proved correct.\nAnd now it is telling me that...\c\nYou may wish to [VAR COLOR(0002)]make some space in your PC Boxes[VAR COLOR(0000)]\nbefore we set out. Just trust me on this.
Pokémon that swim with elegance\nin the vast ocean are nice.\c\nIf you have the move called Surf,\nyou can swim with the Pokémon, too!
Sometimes Pokémon hide underwater, too.\nDo you want me to show the trick to finding them?
All right, all right.\nI’ll teach you everything I know!\c\nIf you take too much time, they’ll\nrun away, so you can’t dawdle!\c\n...\nOh, should I do it?\c\nShould I give away the most\nextraordinary technique I know?!
All right then!\nThis is my most treasured technique.\c\nIt’s about watching the Pokémon closely!\c\nPokémon hiding underwater seem\nto play by coming to the surface\r\nin the places they like in order.\c\nJust when and where they will\ncome to the surface...\c\nBeing able to figure that out is the\nmost important technique of all!
Oh dear!\nHow rude of me!\c\nYou’ve got a look on your face that\nsays, “I’ve known that for a long time!”

That Rusturf Tunnel there...\c\nAt first, we had a huge crew working on\nboring through the rock with the latest machinery.\r\nBut we had to stop.\c\nTurns out we would have had a negative effect\non wild Pokémon in the area.\c\nSo we’re left lazing around here doing nothing!
There’s a man who dug his way to\nVerdanturf all by his lonesome.\r\nHe was desperate to get through.\c\nHe says that if you dig little by little\nwithout using machines, you won’t\r\ndisturb Pokémon, and you’ll avoid harming\r\nthe natural environment.
To get to Verdanturf without using this tunnel,\nyou’d have to cross the sea to Dewford, sail on\r\nto Slateport, and then travel through Mauville.

That tunnel’s filled with Pokémon that react badly to\nloud noises.\r\nThey could cause an uproar.\c\nThat’s why we stopped using heavy equipment\nfor tunneling...\c\nI’m worried that the goon will do something stupid and\nstartle the Pokémon into an uproar.
Grrrrrroar!\c\nThat goofy goon hightailed it out of\nthe tunnel! I can go back to digging!
Oh! It’s you!
You’re that Trainer who helped me in Petalburg Woods\nand also got back my case that was stolen and then\r\ngraciously delivered it to Slateport!\c\nCaptain Stern informed us that the case arrived safely!\c\nI thank you very, very much.\c\nIf I were a rain cloud, I would shower you with gratitude\nand hail you as a hero[VAR GENDBR(00FF,0300)]ine!
For you, most wonderful Trainer, I bear good news!\c\nRecently, our company developed a new kind of\nPoké Ball. As a token of our appreciation for all your help,\r\nwe would like to give you one!

[~ 1]
It’s Lanette’s research notes.\nThere’s information about Boxes.\c\nDesign Boxes to hold 30 Pokémon each.\c\nEach Trainer should be able to store\n900 Pokémon on the PC system.\c\nKeep reading?
A marking system should be added to\nmake organizing Boxes easier.\c\nThe name and wallpaper design of each\nBox will be made changeable.\c\nKeep reading?
When storing a Pokémon, it should be\nsent to the Box inspected last.\c\nIf that Box is full, the received\nPokémon is stored in the next Box.\c\nIn other words, when a Box is examined,\nit is automatically selected as the Box\r\nto which Pokémon are sent.
[VAR TRNAME(0000)] closed the notebook.
There’s an email from someone on\nthe PC.\c\n“...\c\nYour Storage System is quite convenient.\c\nIt has a lot of user-friendly features\nthat make it fun and useful, too.\c\nIt makes me proud that I played\na part in its development.\c\nHere’s hoping that you’ll continue\nresearch in Storage Systems.\c\n...”

Oh, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].\c\nYou want to organize your Boxes in the\nPC more efficiently, don’t you?

That’s what I thought.\c\nHow I arrived at that conclusion is\na simple deductive process.\c\n...Just because you took the trouble\nto talk to me.

What? You’re crying?!\c\nWell, I don’t mind you crying, but please\ndon’t let your tears drop anywhere.\c\n’Cause the moisture and salt content in\ntears may have adverse effects on Fossils.
Sob...sob...\c\nSorry. I’m ashamed of myself.\nYou’re absolutely right...\c\nI was behaving like a spoiled child...\nNow, I’ll excuse myself...
Oh my.\nShe’s still wet behind the ears...\c\nI hope she’ll grow into a great\nstone maniac someday...
Looking at your white Pokémon reminds\nme of the Devon president’s son.\c\nI heard he traveled all the way to Kalos,\ncrossing three oceans to find the white\r\nPokémon and some kind of stone.\c\nThat’s what you’d expect from someone\nwho calls himself a wandering stone collector.

Welcome, welcome.
As you can see, I sell stones.\c\nI sell rare stones that I collect\nby myself on this riverside.
P-p-please wait.\c\nIt’s taken me three years of combing this\nvast riverside to collect this many stones.
What stone would you like to buy today?
Oho, I see you appreciate the value of this\nHard Stone. How very discerning you are!\c\nThe shape, the color...\nThe texture of this stone...\c\nDoesn’t there seem to be an atmosphere about it?\nA feeling as though someone is all alone in space...\c\nSpecially for you, I’ll sell the stone for $45,000!
Well, for beginners, this may suffice.\c\nIts texture is suggestive of a withered\ntree that stands alone.\r\nThat’s not too bad, wouldn’t you say?\c\nI’ll sell this stone for $1,500.

Oho, I see you appreciate the value of this\nHard Stone. How very discerning you are!\c\nThe shape, the color...\nThe texture of this stone...\c\nIt reminds you of a lifetime’s tears trickling\ndown your face, wouldn’t you agree?\c\nSpecially for you, I’ll sell the stone for $150,000!

Thank you very much.\nQuality stones build a life of quality!
I am so very terribly sorry.\nI’m out of stock at the moment.\c\nBut I’ll go stone hunting, by which\nI mean searching for stones,\r\nvery soon with my friends.\c\nAnyway, more and more young people are\nshowing an interest in stones nowadays.\r\nIt’s very promising.\c\nOn the next scheduled stone hunt, a young\nman named Steven and a young girl\r\nnamed Roxanne will be coming with us.

Wh-what should I do?\nMy fountain of ideas for tricks has run dry...\c\nPerhaps it is time I toured the country\non a quest to devise new tricks...
I hate to admit defeat, but you have bested me!\c\nStill, you must have been reeled in by my charisma for\nyou to visit me again and again.

Bravo! Splendid showing!\c\nYour love of cycling comes from deep\nwithin your heart.\r\nYou’ve shaken me to my very soul!
Your technique is remarkable.\c\nI suggest you slow down just enough\nto avoid collisions.
I would consider you a work in\nprogress.\c\nStill, I hope you don’t forget the\nsheer pleasure of cycling.
My word... Your cycling skills border\non terrifying.\c\nMost certainly, you need much more\npractice riding.
I am aghast...\c\nYou’re perhaps not cut out for this\nunfortunate cycling business.\c\nYou ought to give serious thought to\nreturning that Bike to Rydel.
This is the Cycling Road.\c\nIf you ride from Mauville to Slateport\non a Mach Bike, you can be rated for\r\nyour collisions and your total time.
Regardless of the results, I count on\nseeing more challenges from you.\r\nAlways aim higher!
On this Cycling Road, folks riding\nMach Bikes are rated on number\r\nof collisions and total time.\c\nAcro Bikes do not qualify for rating.\nThey are easy to turn, so it’s not fair.

Team Magma’s activities must be kept\nsecret for now.
If our members in Slateport do well, the next\ndestination is Mt. Chimney.\r\nI have to jot it down.
This is my first job after joining\nTeam Magma... I’m nervous.
Team Magma’s actions should put a smile\non everyone’s face.\c\nMaybe... Perhaps...
You want to know about Team Aqua’s activities?\c\nHahaha!\nIt’s a bit too difficult for kids to understand them.
I wanted to go to Slateport and\nkick up a ruckus!\c\nWell, that’s OK.\nI’ll make up for it by getting all\r\nfired up in Mt. Chimney!
This is my first job after joining\nTeam Aqua. I’ve got the shakes!
Team Aqua’s actions will put a smile\non the face of every Pokémon!
Hey, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]! It’s been ages!\c\nNice timing, too. I was just searching\nfor Pokémon, you know?
My dad is always going on about how\nnature used to be even more diverse,\r\nway back in the day.\c\nHe says that there used to be way more\nkinds of Pokémon than there are now!\c\nSo that’s why we do fieldwork, him and me.\nWe really want to find out what happened\r\nto those Pokémon in the past.
On my journey up to now, I’ve met a lot\nof different Pokémon, and I think I’ve\r\ngotten to understand a lot of them, too.\r\nMe and my Pokémon have really grown.\c\nSo...
How about a little battle?
[~ 12]
[VAR TRNAME(0000)], you’ve been busy\ntraining, too, haven’t you?
Oops! But look at us!\nOur teams look pretty tired.\r\nLet’s get them taken care of first.
And now I think you deserve a reward, too!\nHere, this is from me!
That’s a Dowsing Machine.\c\nTry it out—if there’s a hidden item anywhere\nnear you, that little thing will react to tell you.\c\nPay attention, and it’ll lead you right to items!\c\nAnd it’s fun to see all those waving bits above\nyour head. Try it, and I bet you’ll be hooked!\c\nCareful—you won’t be able to sneak up on\nPokémon while you wear it!
See you later then, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\nLet’s meet again!
I hope we’ll both be able to meet even\nmore Pokémon on our journeys!
Hey, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].\nSo this is where you’ve been.\r\nHow’ve things been going?\c\nI was just checking out the\nPokémon around here to help\r\nwith my dad’s research.\c\nHe says that a long, long time\nago, nature used to be way more\r\ndiverse and there were lots more\r\nkinds of Pokémon, too.\c\nMy dad and I want to learn more\nabout those Pokémon from the\r\npast, you know?\r\nThat’s why we do fieldwork.\c\nAnd this journey has really helped.\nI’ve met a lot of Pokémon on my way\r\nhere and learned about them, too.
Which reminds me!\c\nCome on! It’s the first time we’ve met\nin ages, so let’s have a battle!\c\nShow me what you and your team have\naccomplished on your journey, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!
[~ 21]
Sheesh, [VAR TRNAME(0000)], when did you go\nand train your Pokémon up that well?\c\nIt’s, like, I don’t know...\nIt’s pretty surprising, OK!
Both our teams look pretty\nwiped out after that, huh!\r\nHere, let me help them out.
And this is for you.
That’s a Dowsing Machine.\c\nUse it to root around for items that aren’t visible.\nIf it senses something nearby, it’ll react, see?\c\nTruth is, once I started using it, I got pretty\nhooked on it. It’s addicting!\r\nBut I recommend you give it a try.\c\nCareful though, you won’t be able to sneak up on\nPokémon while you wear it!
I guess I’m off to get started\nsurveying the next area then.\c\nI hope you meet a lot of\nPokémon, too, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!
Which should I choose?\c\nMake a beeline for Mauville on the\nCycling Road, or take the low road\r\nand look for Pokémon?
I don’t have a Bike, so I’ll take a\nleisurely walk on the low road.
The two roads, one above, one below...\c\nA road each for people and Pokémon.\nPerhaps that is right and fair.
Wouldn’t it be great to ride a Bike\nat full speed on the Cycling Road?

Let’s keep going through Route 110\nand head for Mt. Chimney!
It’ll be quite a long journey.\c\nLet’s take a rest in [VAR COLOR(0002)]Mauville City[VAR COLOR(0000)], which is on the way.
I concur!
Let’s keep going through Route 110\nand head for Mt. Chimney!
Wow, that’s quite far.\c\nWhy don’t we take a rest in [VAR COLOR(0002)]Mauville City[VAR COLOR(0000)].\nIt’s on the way.

Ah, the sea.\c\nI wonder what it’s like at\nthe bottom of the sea.
If you’re going to throw a Poké Ball,\nweaken the wild Pokémon first.\c\nIt’ll be easier to catch if it’s been poisoned,\nburned, lulled to sleep, or suchlike.
You’re no better than a thief if you\ntry to steal someone else’s Pokémon.\c\nYou should only throw Poké Balls\nat wild Pokémon you encounter.
Oh no, I’m not a Trainer!\c\nBut it’s true that Trainers locking eyes\nis basically an invitation to battle.\c\nIf you don’t want to battle with people,\ntry to stay out of their line of sight!

Hello!\c\nThis is the Pretty Petal flower shop.\nSpreading flowers throughout the world!
Your name is?\c\n[VAR TRNAME(0000)].\nThat’s a nice name.

[VAR TRNAME(0000)], would you like to learn\nabout Berries?
[VAR TRNAME(0000)], would you like to learn\nabout Berries?
Berries grow on trees that thrive only in soft soil.\c\nIf you take some Berries, be sure to plant one in\nsoft soil.\c\nA planted Berry will soon sprout, grow into a plant,\nflower beautifully, and then grow Berries again.\c\nI want to see the whole wide world filled with\nbeautiful flowers.\r\nThat’s my dream.
Please help me, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].\nPlant Berries, and bring more flowers into the world.
Please help me, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].\nPlant Berries, and bring more flowers into the world.
Flowers bring so much happiness to people, don’t they?
Hello!\c\nFlowers will bloom beautifully and bear many\nBerries if you take good care of them.\c\nYou’ll like tending flowers, I’m sure.\nYou can have this.
While Berry plants are growing,\nwater them with the Wailmer Pail.\c\nOh, another thing.\c\nIf you don’t pick Berries for a while,\nthey’ll drop off onto the ground.\r\nBut they’ll sprout again.\c\nIsn’t that awesome?\nIt’s like they have the will to live.
I’m trying to be like my big sisters.\nI’m growing flowers, too!\c\nHere you go! It’s for you!
You can plant a Berry to grow more Berries,\nor you can have a Pokémon hold it.\c\nBut now there’s a machine that mixes up\ndifferent Berries to makes candies for Pokémon.\c\n...I want some candy, too.
Flowers of various colors are blooming.\nThey smell wonderful...
Select “Berries” on your AreaNav, and you can\ncheck the places where you planted Berries.
And when the Berry plants sprout Berries, Berry symbols\nwill be shown on the Berry list on your AreaNav.\c\nSo I recommend you check it often.

Wassup!\nI like to shout my lungs out! It feels so good!\c\nYou can have this, so you try it out!\c\nUse it on a Pokémon, and it will learn a move that\nattacks with its voice.\c\nIf the move is used several times in a row, it becomes\nmore powerful!
A word of advice!\nA TM, or Technical Machine, can be used many times.\c\nIt won’t go away.\nSo try it out as many times as you want!
This flower shop started selling\npotted plants recently.\c\nIt made me so happy, I went overboard\nshopping. I don’t need this White Herb\r\nanymore. Would you take it, please?
This flower shop started selling\npotted plants recently.\c\nIt made me so happy, I went overboard\nshopping. Where should I put them?
If you see Berries growing in soft\nsoil, feel free to take them.\c\nBut make sure you plant a Berry in the\nsame spot. That’s common courtesy.\c\nHere, I’ll share this with you.
The way you look, you must be a Trainer, no?\c\nTrainers often make Pokémon\nhold Berries.\c\nIt’s up to you whether to grow Berries\nor use them.
Route 104\n↑ Rustboro City

Trainer Tips\c\nThere are pairs of Trainers who challenge others for\ntwo-on-two Pokémon battles called Double Battles.\c\nIn a Double Battle, the Trainer must send out two\nPokémon, the ones at the top left and the top right\r\nof their list.\c\nPay attention to how you array the Pokémon in your list!

Well then, why don’t we go ahead and have a\nquick battle?\c\nI’ll give you a taste of what being a Trainer is\nreally like!

[~ 5]
Wow... I think I know why my dad has his eye on\nyou now.\c\nI mean, you just got that Pokémon, and you’ve already\ngot that strong of a bond.
I bet you could probably befriend any kind of\nPokémon you meet!
Phew...\nI guess I’d better head back to the lab!
OK, so it’s this one and that\none that live on Route 103...
Huh?\c\nHey, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!
Ohhh. So you finally got a\nPokémon from my dad?\c\nThen how about a little battle?\nSince we’re here and all!
I’m going to teach you what\nbeing a Trainer’s all about!
[~ 13]
I think I know why my dad\nhad his eye on you now.
Look, you just got your Pokémon, right?\nAnd you already have that strong of a bond?\c\nI get the feeling that you could befriend any\nPokémon, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]. No doubt.
Well, I’ve got some good data here,\nso I guess it’s time I got back to the lab.\r\nYou should head back, too, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!

Hm?
Whoa!\nCheck ’em out, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!

Halloo! You over there!\nPlease! Help me out!\c\nIn my Bag!\nThere are some Poké Balls!

Oh?\c\nBut you’re Norman’s boy, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\c\nI didn’t even realize who you were at first.\nYou’ve grown into quite the young man.\c\nThis isn’t the place for a chat, though.\nCome along to my lab.

That’s an Egg, isn’t it?\c\nYou can’t possibly teach a move\nto an Egg!
That won’t work! That Pokémon cannot learn\nthe moves I can teach!

Hmm... Do you want me to teach\nDragon Ascent to your Pokémon?

Which Pokémon do you want\nme to teach the move?
That Pokémon can’t learn Dragon Ascent.\nOnly Rayquaza can learn the move.
Ohoho!\nDo you want me to teach the move to the Egg?\r\nYou youngsters sure know how to joke.
That Rayquaza has already\nlearned Dragon Ascent.
Do you want me to teach [VAR MOVE(0001)]\nto the [VAR PKNAME(0000)]?
Dragon Ascent is a powerful move\nthat only Rayquaza can use.\c\nThey say its power is so strong that\neven a huge meteoroid can be broken\r\ninto pieces with one attack.\c\nWell, you must know best\nabout how fierce it is, though.

If you wish, I can teach your Pokémon\nthe strongest Dragon-type move.\c\nWould you like your Pokémon to learn that move?
Understood.\nCome again if you change your mind.
Hmm...\c\nThis Pokémon can learn this move, but\nyour bond of friendship is not yet\r\nstrong enough.\c\nThat means I cannot teach it this move.
I see...\c\nBut there are no Pokémon with\nyou right now that can learn this move.
Which Pokémon should\nlearn this move?
I’m very sorry, but...\c\nThis Pokémon cannot learn this move.
That’s an interesting request, but...\nNot even I can teach a move to an Egg.

Let’s protect Latios from these beasts together.\c\nWe cannot allow Latios or even a Mega Stone\nto fall into the hands of such villains!
Let’s protect Latias from these beasts together.\c\nWe cannot allow Latias or even a Mega Stone\nto fall into the hands of such villains!
Oh ho!\nIf you’re really that stupid, then I have no choice\r\nbut to squash you!
Eeep?!
Oh ho!\nStrong, ain’tcha?
You’re an interesting punk, too, I’ll give you that!
I love interesting, strong dudes!\nThat’s why I love my bro, Archie!\c\nAnd that’s why I’m gonna start\nloving you from now on, too!\c\nNext time I see you,\nI’ll smash you up real good, OK?
Let’s get outta here, you dull Grunt!
Y...yes...sir...
Hah...
Good work, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].
Good work, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].
You performed spectacularly.\c\nWe were able to protect both\nthis wondrous Pokémon and its\r\nMega Stone, thanks to you.
And it looks as though Latios\nmay have also recognized you\r\nas a Trainer worthy of its trust.
And it looks as though Latias\nmay have also recognized you\r\nas a Trainer worthy of its trust.
Look. It’s trying to offer you its allegiance.\c\nI believe it is trying to show that it wants\nto go with you on your journey.
Go on. Hold out your hand to it.
Latios joined your team!
Latias joined your team!
You should take this from me...
With the Mega Bracelet that I just gave you\nand the Mega Stones that a Pokémon may hold,\r\nyour Pokémon will be able to achieve a powerful\r\nboost, quite unlike any usual form of Evolution...\r\nbut only if you are bound by great affection.\c\nYou will be able to achieve [VAR COLOR(0002)]Mega Evolution[VAR COLOR(0000)].\c\nI suggest you try it with Latios the next time that\nyou happen to have the chance in battle.

Mega Evolution is a phenomenon that\nhas long been shrouded in mystery.\c\nWhat is a Mega Stone?\nWhat is a Key Stone?\c\nThe process by which bonds between\nPokémon and people manifest in tangible\r\npower... How do we explain that?
If that settles that...\nShould we be heading back?\c\nTogether with Latias, waiting\nso patiently for us there...

All dreams are but another reality.\nNever forget...

Hah?!
M-Mistress Courtney!\c\nThat pipsqueak over there is the kid\nthat I heard keeps getting in our way!
But that enviably unruffled-looking\nfellow there with him...\c\nHm. I feel like I ought to know him\nfrom somewhere...\r\nMaybe he’s a contest star?
Yes.
For the time being...get away from me.
The Pokémon behind you...\c\nIts Mega Stone...\c\nNo more...no less.\c\nThat is what...\c\nThat’s what we of Team Magma seek.
How about it?\nWill you get away from me...\r\nor not?
I won’t!
Sure. Why not?
...\c\nWell then...
Puyah?!
As anticipated.
Unanticipated.
You.\nTarget lock...completed.\c\nCommencing...experiment.\c\nYou. Forever.\nAha... ♪
Returning home.
W-wait for me!\nCourtne-e-e-y!
Shwahhn!
Hyahhn!
Latios is staring steadily at [VAR TRNAME(0000)]...
Latias is staring steadily at [VAR TRNAME(0000)]...
Hm?\nThere’s something on the ground here...
You seem to remember Steven warning\nyou about something...\c\n“Do not be hasty in your excitement.\nYou may wish to [VAR COLOR(0002)]organize your PC Boxes[VAR COLOR(0000)]\r\nbefore we set out. Just trust me on this.”\c\n...\c\nThat’s right! Time to [VAR COLOR(0002)]organize your PC Boxes[VAR COLOR(0000)]!
Would you like to give a nickname to Latios?
Would you like to give a nickname to Latias?
You’d like to nickname it [VAR PKNICK(0000)]?
Are you sure you don’t want to\ngive it a nickname?
Your party is full!\c\nPlease select a Pokémon to\nsend back to your PC Boxes.
[VAR PKNICK(0000)] is carrying a piece of Latiosite!
[VAR PKNICK(0000)] is carrying a piece of Latiasite!
I hope that the Mega Bracelet I just gave you\nmight bring us one step closer to finding\r\nthe answer to these questions.
Ah, that’s right.\c\nWe should first heal up the Pokémon\nthat fought on our behalf, shouldn’t we?
Your team’s health was restored!

We’ve arrived.
Thank you, Latias.
Thank you, Latios.
...\c\nI don’t know what it is...
Not quite unease, not quite fear...\c\nBut there is something...unsettling...
It is an odd feeling, as though I am walking in a dream—\nor an illusion.
I once heard an odd fable.\c\nIt was said that the two Pokémon that live on this\nisland guard some secret about that great form\r\nof Evolution: Mega Evolution.\c\nCould it be that some dangerous element is here\nbecause of that?\c\n...\c\nCome, we should be going.
What is it you want to do?\nWould you like to return to Route 118 for a time?
I understand.
Latias, if you would oblige...
Latios, if you would oblige...
In that case...\c\nShall we go see once and for all whether\nthere is anything to be found on this island?
Now then...\c\nShall we go see once and for all whether\nthere is anything to be found on this island?

I am researching Pokémon Fossils here.\c
You have a Fossil, don’t you?\nShall I restore it for you?
What’s this? You seem to have plenty\nof Pokémon with you already.\c\nAre you still sure you want me to turn\nyour Fossil back into a Pokémon?
Which Fossil should I restore for you?
OK, then!\c\nI’ll turn that [VAR ITEM2(0000)] back into a\nPokémon for you!\c
Oh, you’d like to keep it as a Fossil?\nI understand.
I’m working to turn your Fossil back into\na Pokémon right now!

[VAR TRNAME(0002)] received [VAR PKNAME(0001)]!
Would you like to give your new\n[VAR PKNAME(0001)] a nickname?
Oh, I’m sorry. You have no space for it.\c\nI will take care of this Pokémon for now, but\nplease come back to pick it up later!

You can call me the Judge.\c\nHeh heh, that’s actually not my real name,\nbut it’s what everyone calls me.\c\nIt’s because of this weird power I have.\nIt’s a gift, really.\c\nI can discern—or judge, you might say—the\noverall potential of individual Pokémon.\c\nHow about it? Let me judge the intriguing\npotential of your Pokémon!
Hey there! So how about it? Are you gonna let me\njudge the intriguing potential of your Pokémon?
...Oh?\nYou don’t need me to judge? I get it.
Judge an Egg?!\nThat’s a tall order even for me!
I see, I see...\c\nThis Pokémon’s potential is\ndecent all around.\c\nThat’s how I judge it, anyway.
I see... I see...\c\nThis Pokémon’s potential is\nabove average overall.\c\nThat’s how I judge it, anyway.
I see... I see...\c\nThis Pokémon has relatively\nsuperior potential overall.\c\nThat’s how I judge it, anyway.
I see... I see...\c\nThis Pokémon has outstanding\npotential overall.\c\nThat’s how I judge it, anyway.
Incidentally, I would say that its\ngreatest potential lies in its HP.
Incidentally, I would say that its greatest\npotential lies in its Attack stat.
Incidentally, I would say that its greatest\npotential lies in its Defense stat.
Incidentally, I would say that its greatest\npotential lies in its Sp. Atk stat.
Incidentally, I would say that its greatest\npotential lies in its Sp. Def stat.
Incidentally, I would say that its greatest\npotential lies in its Speed stat.
But its Attack stat is good, too.
Hmm. And its Defense stat is good, too.
Although its Sp. Atk stat is equally good.
Its Sp. Def stat seems just as good, though.
And, well, its Speed stat is good, too.
It has rather decent stats, I’d say.\nThat’s how I judge it.
It’s definitely got some good stats.\nThat’s how I judge it.
This Pokémon has some fantastic stats.\nThat’s how I judge it.
Stats like those... They simply can’t be beat!\nThat’s how I judge it.
But its HP... It’s pretty dismal, you know?
But this Attack stat... It’s terrible...
But how can you make it through battle\nwith this kind of Defense stat?
But this Sp. Atk won’t even leave\na scratch on an opponent...
But this low of a Sp. Def stat is going to\nleave you high and dry...
But you won’t get anywhere fast with\nthis low of a Speed stat...
And that’s quite a disappointing Attack\nstat there, isn’t it?
And that Defense stat is nothing to write\nhome about, you know?
And I’m afraid that its Sp. Atk is pretty\nbad, too...
And it looks like it’s no great shakes when\nit comes to Sp. Def either...
And that Speed stat... Well, it’s nothing\nto brag about, that’s for sure.

Your Pokédex must be jam-packed with\nall the memories of your journey...\r\nI hope you treasure it always!
What’s this?! What a surprise!\c\nYou’ve already completed your\nHoenn Pokédex, have you?

You’ve caught a total of [VAR NUM3(0000)] kinds\nof Pokémon! Fantastic!

[~ 20]
[~ 21]
[~ 22]
Why, look at this! You’ve finished\nthe entire Hoenn Pokédex! Fantastic!
I think you’d benefit from a bit more\nfieldwork out in the tall grass!
It looks like you’re getting the hang of things.\nBut the adventure has barely begun!
Remember, when Pokémon appear in only one location,\nyou’ve got no choice but to keep on searching.
It’s still got a lot of room to grow, but\nit’s starting to look like a real Pokédex!
This is really looking good!\nKeep up this kind of pace!
Have you been using any fishing rods?\nThere are plenty of Pokémon in the sea!
Have you focused on evolving the Pokémon\nyou have, as well as catching new ones?
Why, congratulations!\c\nYou’ve seen all of the Pokémon\nin the Hoenn Pokédex!

Now that things are looking up for Hoenn, if you\ntravel widely, you’re sure to meet new Pokémon!
I get the feeling that this is on its way\nto being a fine Pokédex. Never fear!
To think you’d have caught this many Pokémon...\nYou really do have a talent for this!
It’s said that there are many possibilities\nlurking in the Evolution of Pokémon.
Have you spent any time in the Safari Zone?\c\nFrom what I hear, it’s the only place in Hoenn\nto catch certain Pokémon!
You’ve finally broken the big 3-0-0!\nThis is a splendid Pokédex!
Oh, that reminds me... I believe there are some\nPokémon that you can find using Rock Smash...
Maybe trading Pokémon with others will\nhelp you fill up some Pokédex entries.
Did you know that there are some Pokémon\nthat evolve when they feel friendly toward you?
Mega Evolution...\nPrimal Reversion...\c\nAnd who knows what other forms of Evolution that\nmay have become lost in the passage of time...\c\nMany evolutionary possibilities may have come and\ngone since Pokémon first appeared in our world...
Getting to meet the Pokémon who exist in the same\nbrief span of time as you...\c\nWhen you think of it like that, filling in the Pokédex\nfeels like something of a miracle!
One can learn about all the Pokémon in Hoenn\nby looking through your Pokédex!
The GTS is an effective tool for completing\nyour Pokédex! Give it a try sometime!
I’d recommend trading some\nPokémon with your friends.
I must say, you wouldn’t make a\nbad Pokémon Professor yourself.
Look at this Pokédex!\nYou’re like a pro now!
Amazing! You’re so close to becoming\na master of Pokémon catching!
Almost 700...\nJust a little more! Keep going!
How exciting! You’ve nearly completed the\nNational Pokédex! I’m absolutely sure you can do it!
Congratulations to you!\nYou’ve completed the Pokédex!\c\nSniffle...\nI am overwhelmed.\c\nMy decision to give you that Pokédex\nI’d ordered was wholly justified.\c\nThis completed Pokédex is a\ntestament to your hard work...\c\nAnd to the support of the\nmany who helped you...\c\nAnd to the bonds you have\nbuilt with your Pokémon!\c\nIt is a unique treasure!
You’ve been meeting new Pokémon\nat a good clip, haven’t you?\c\nI’ve got a little something for you, and\nI’d love it if you stopped by the lab!
You’ve been meeting new Pokémon\nat a good clip, haven’t you?\c\nHere, take this as a little reward\nfor all your hard work!
If you’re holding an Oval Charm,\nyou’ll have a better chance of finding\r\nan Egg at the Pokémon Day Care.
Holding a Shiny Charm will improve your\nchances of finding a Shiny Pokémon!

See, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]?\nIsn’t it nice in here, too?
The moving company’s Pokémon even\nhelp with the unpacking and cleanup.\r\nThey really make moving a cinch!
Well, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]?\c\nDon’t you want to go\nsee your new room?
[VAR TRNAME(0000)], go set the clock\nin your room, honey.\c\nI hung it on the wall, right between\nyour desk and that big map.
Oh! [VAR TRNAME(0000)]! [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!!!\nQuick! Come quickly!
It’s the Petalburg Gym!\nMaybe Dad will be on TV!
Interviewer: ...
Interviewer: We brought you this report live from\nin front of Petalburg Gym.\c\nNext up, a special look at a long-awaited meteor shower\nin the next star show...
Oh... It’s already ended.\c\nLooks like your dad was on, but we missed his part.\c\nWhat a shame.
But that reminds me...\nOne of Dad’s friends lives in this town.\c\n[VAR COLOR(0002)]Professor Birch[VAR COLOR(0000)] is his name.\c\nHe lives [VAR COLOR(0002)]right next door[VAR COLOR(0000)], so you should go over and\nintroduce yourself.
[VAR COLOR(0002)]Professor Birch lives right next door[VAR COLOR(0000)].\nYour dad would want you to go say hi.\r\nGo stop by while I clean up around here.
Did you get to meet Professor Birch?
You feeling OK, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]?\nYou look a little tired.\c\nI think you should rest a bit.
Now take care out there, honey!
Oh? Did Dad give you that Badge?!\c\nThen here’s something from your mom!
It’s a wonderful thing to try hard at your passion,\nbut don’t push yourself too hard, dear.\c\nYou can always come home if you need to.\nGood luck, honey!
Graoh, graoh, graoh...
Gwagwah gwah...
A movie is on TV.\c\nTwo men are dancing\non a big piano keyboard.\c\nBetter get going!

Welcome!\c\nWe have a daughter about the same age as you.\c\nShe has been so excited about making a new friend.\c\nShe should be in [VAR COLOR(0002)]her room upstairs[VAR COLOR(0000)].\nI hope you’ll go and introduce yourself!

Oh? If it’s Brendan you’re wanting,\nhe’s gone off somewhere again.\c\nThat child is just like his father!\nCan’t stay in the house for five minutes!
It’s all well and good to want to\nadventure with your Pokémon...\c\nBut kids should at least stop by\nhome from time to time!\c\nYou should drop by to reassure\nyour mother that you’re fine.\c\nI’m sure your mother worries\nabout you as well, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].

The clock on the wall isn’t moving...\c\nYou’ve got to set the time!
Now the hands are moving right on time!
It’s a pretty cool wall clock!
It’s a pretty cute wall clock!
How do you like your new room, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]?\c\nGood! Everything’s put away neatly!\c\nThey finished moving everything in downstairs, too.\c\nIt really is so nice having Pokémon around to help us!\c\nOh, but you should make sure that everything’s all there\non your desk.

[VAR TRNAME(0000)] peered closely at\nthe Hoenn region’s Town Map!
It’s a Wii U!\nIt has a GamePad with a screen!
Pokémon fully restored,\nitems all ready, and...
Huh?!\c\nWho...are you?
...
Oh! You must be [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\nYour move was today, huh?
Well, I’m May!\nGlad to meet you!
I...I actually have this dream of becoming\nfriends with Pokémon all over the world.
And then when Dad—oh, I mean Professor Birch—\ntold me about you moving here, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]...\c\nWell, I was hoping you would be nice\nand we could be friends.
...B-but that’s just silly, isn’t it?\c\nI’ve just met you. Right, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]?\c\nSo what am I talking about...
Hee hee...
Oh no! I forgot!\c\nI was supposed to be going out to\nhelp Dad catch some wild Pokémon!
[VAR TRNAME(0000)], I’ll see you later!
[VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\c\nI was just checking my Pokédex.\c\nThere’s still a lot of Pokémon that\nI’ve seen but haven’t caught.\c\nAnd there are plenty more that\nI think can still evolve further.\c\nI wonder where I should go\nnext to catch more Pokémon...
I wonder where I should go\nnext to catch more Pokémon...\c\nHopefully somewhere that I might\nrun into you again, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!
Pokémon fully restored...\nItems all packed, and...
Y-you...\c\nWho are you?
[VAR TRNAME(0000)]?\c\nOh, you’re the new kid who just moved in next door?!
Huh...\nI didn’t know that you’d be a girl.
Dad—I mean, Professor Birch—told me\nyou were the kid of a Gym Leader,\r\nand I sort of hoped you’d be a guy.
My name’s Brendan.\nWell, I guess we are still neighbors, so...\r\nNice to meet you! Let’s be friends, OK?
Huh? Hey, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]...\nDon’t you have any Pokémon?\c\nIf you want, I can go catch you one.
Aw, wait, I forgot...\c\nI’m supposed to be going out to help my dad catch\nsome wild Pokémon.
Some other time, OK?
Oh! Hey, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\c\nI was just checking out my Pokédex.\c\nI know there are even more Pokémon I need\nto catch, but it’s still pretty impressive, right?\c\nChecking this Pokédex out gives me the urge\nto hit the road again on another adventure...
I’m having a hard time deciding where\nI should go to catch Pokémon next...\c\nBut, hey, if I run into you while I’m out\nthere catching Pokémon, [VAR TRNAME(0000)],\r\nI can pitch you a battle if you want.
[~ 68]

There are some notes on the page,\nwritten in cute, round script.\c\n“★ This will be on the next test! ★\c\nEach Pokémon can learn up to four moves!\nWhich moves you teach a Pokémon will\r\nshow how good of a Trainer you are!”
There are some notes on the page,\nwritten in spare, angular script.\c\n“This’ll be on the test! Don’t forget!\c\nEach Pokémon can learn up to four moves!\nWhich moves you teach a Pokémon will\r\nshow how good of a Trainer you are!”
Thanks for all the hard work!\nWe really appreciate it!
You should go and see your new\nroom upstairs, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\c\nDad even bought a new clock for\nit to help celebrate the big move.\r\nYou’ll need to set the time, though!
The hour hand was set to [VAR NUM2(0000)]\nand the minute hand to [VAR NUM2(0001)]!
Hm?
Why, if it isn’t [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\c\nIt’s been some time since I last saw you,\nbut you look...stronger, somehow.\r\nThat’s the impression I get.
But your old man hasn’t given up yet!
Oh, and before I forget...\nI was thinking of giving these to you.
They’re tickets to the star show that’s\nbeing held at the Mossdeep Space Center.\c\nI was really planning to go with your mom, but...
It looks like I’ve got to rush back to the Gym\nin Petalburg.
Oh! Hmm.\nYou know, it is a pair of tickets...
Why don’t you invite that little cutie May from next door\nto come along?
Why don’t you invite that Brendan boy from next door\nto come along?
Now I’d better be heading back to the Gym.
Thanks for looking after the house while I’m away, dear.
Of course, dear. You have a safe trip.
Ohhh, that dad of yours!\nHe comes home for the first time in ages,\r\nand all he talks about is Pokémon!\c\nWhy can’t he ever just let go and relax?
Television: ...And tomorrow the long-\nawaited star show will finally begin!\r\nWe’ve got all the latest news and updates!
Oh? Well, and just like that...\c\nLook at this, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!
Newscaster: At last the Litleonid meteor\nshower returns to illuminate Hoenn’s night sky!\c\nThe star show held at the Mossdeep Space\nCenter will provide the best view of the shooting\r\nstars from the center’s lofty viewing deck!\c\nWe hope you all will take the chance to join...
Oh! It sounds lovely!
The Litleonids, hmm?\c\nI remember going to see them with your dad\n11 years ago when they last passed by!
You should march right over to invite that\nneighbor [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0304)]girlboy you’re friends with.\c\nYou can’t let that pair of tickets you got from Dad go\nto waste—so take h[VAR GENDBR(00FF,0202)]erim along!
It’s an advertisement for the\nspace show in Mossdeep.\c\n...\c\nBetter get going!
Ughhh...
Owwww...
May, are you OK?!\c\nOh, what should I do!\nWhat should I do?! Oh, wibble...
Brendan, are you OK?!\c\nOh, what should I do!\nWhat should I do?! Oh, wibble...
It’s not that big of a deal, Mom.\nShe just knocked me down a bit...\r\nYowch! That stings!
It’s not that big of a deal, Mom.\nShe just knocked me down a bit...\r\nYowch! That stings!

[VAR TRNAME(0000)], you...\nYou’re all right, huh?\r\n...That’s a relief.
Looks like she didn’t get you, huh?\nThat’s a relief.
It all happened so fast that I couldn’t do a thing, but...\c\nSome strange woman came in my window, upstairs...\c\nAnd then she... She took my Key Stone from me...

I think I heard her muttering under\nher breath as she left, though...\r\nSomething like “[VAR COLOR(0002)]Petalburg’s next[VAR COLOR(0000)]...”\c\n[VAR TRNAME(0000)]...be careful.

I’m really happy you came to visit\nme, but...I’m sorry...\r\nI think I’ll have to sit this one out.
Um, it’s really cool that you\ncame to visit me, but...sorry...\r\nI think I gotta sit this one out...
Who could have done such\na thing to my sweet [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0304)]girlboy...
Oh, hello, sweetie.\nFeel free to stay awhile.
[~ 115]
[~ 116]
[~ 117]
Hm?
Morning, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].
You must’ve been bushed.\nYou slept like a log.
Oh, but before I forget...\c\nThis came for you.\nIt’s from someone named Briney.
Hm, so it was a ferry ticket, was it?
As I recall, you can catch the ferry\nfrom the ports in Slateport and Lilycove.
[VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\c\nIf you have ambition as a Trainer, I want you to take that\nferry to the [VAR COLOR(0002)]Battle Resort[VAR COLOR(0000)].\c\nI think it will teach you that there is no end to a\nTrainer’s chosen path.
I’d better be heading back to the Petalburg Gym, then.\c\nThanks for looking after the house while I’m away, honey.
Ohhh, that dad of yours!\nCan’t he ever forget about work?\c\nI wish he could just switch it off\nand take it easy sometimes!\c\nBut I love him just the way he is...
I suppose May and [VAR TRNAME(0000)] have probably\narrived by now...
I suppose Brendan and [VAR TRNAME(0000)] have probably\narrived by now...
I imagine so.
The weather is good today.\nThey should get a good view of the stars.
But you know...I really am glad we moved here\nfrom Johto.
I think that meeting you, Birch, and Mrs. Birch and\nlittle May, has had a huge impact on\r\n[VAR TRNAME(0000)]’s life.
I think that meeting you, Birch, and\nMrs. Birch and your boy, has had a\r\nhuge impact on [VAR TRNAME(0000)]’s life.
Oh, it’s just the same for our [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0703)]MayBrendan.
Don’t you agree, dear?
Of course!
Whenever she does make it home, all May has to talk\nabout is Pokémon and her precious friend\r\n[VAR TRNAME(0000)].
Whenever he does make it home, all Brendan has to talk\nabout is Pokémon and his pal [VAR TRNAME(0000)].
I think [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0001)]she’s over the moon about this\nadventure and the great friend [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0001)]she’s found.
I think our [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0403)]boygirl is just the same.\n[VAR GENDBR(00FF,0201)]HShe always looks so happy these days.
I hope you’ll continue to look after our\n[VAR TRNAME(0000)] for many more years to come.
Bwahahaha! Why, Norman!\nYou don’t even have to ask...\r\nNothing could make me happier!
Hahahaha...\nThanks, old friend.
...Well then, dear, isn’t it about time we were headed\nback home?\r\nI should get supper started...
Oh, yes! Those kids’ll probably be starving when\nthey get home!
Oh, I didn’t make any plans yet for dinner...\nWhat do you think we should have, dear?
Hmm.\nHow about our little [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0403)]boygirl’s favorite?
...Oh!
That reminds me!\nHere!\c\nI’ve been thinking I should\ngive you this, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]...
Remember the night you went to see the star show?\c\nWell, I found this in the grass out front the next morning!\c\nIsn’t it pretty, the way it sparkles?\nIt’s like a rainbow!
Looks like Mom jotted something down!\nThere are notes about tonight’s dinner plans!
There are plans for a whole week’s worth of meals!

Sigh...\c\nI have today off from work, but it’s like...\nJust thinking about going back tomorrow\r\nis dragging me down. I feel so unmotivated.
Hey, do you have a minute for a story?\c\nThis is something that happened when I\nwas watching the store one time...
It was, like, a totally dark night. Moonless.\nAnd I was all, “No way! This is so-o-o-o creepy!”\r\nThen, suddenly—whoosh!\c\nOut of nowhere, the automatic sliding\ndoor...slides open.\c\nAnd then this super-duper-scary old guy comes in,\nkinda unsteady, you know? Kinda shambling...
So I’m thinking how terrible and scary is this,\nand then the old guy shuffles over to me...\r\nHe has a package, like, clutched in his hands...\r\nHe’s mumbling that he has to show it to me...\c\nThen he asks, “Do you know what this is worth?”\c\nHe keeps staring right at me and not even blinking.\nI was so freaked out. I was, like...\c\n“Oh yes. It’s, uh, really something, isn’t it?”
So the old guy grins at me, and he says...\c\n“Then I’ll just give you this instead of money.\nNow give me everything you’ve got in this store!”\r\nThat’s what he said! Really!\c\nI was like, “What is this? Too weird, my dude!”\nBut I was scared, so I started shoveling over\r\nPotions and, like, whatever I could reach.\r\nI gave the dude everything for his stupid package.\c\nAnd out he goes, like, with a wicked grin on his face...
As he’s walking out, he says, “Three days... For a\nmere three days will Hoopa be unbound...” Really!\c\nI was all, “Stop freaking me out with this nonsense!”\nI was, like, sweating. The back of my shirt was soaked.\c\nAnyway, nothing I could do, so I open the package.\nIt’s just a dirty old bottle. Li-i-i-i-ike, really.\c\nSo I go, “Weirdness. Wonder what’s in it.”\nI grab the stopper and carefully pull it loose.\c\nBlapt! It popped open, but there was nothing inside!\nSo I figure I totally got fooled.
...Thanks for listening to my story.\c\nKnow what? I’m gonna give you the bottle\nfrom that night ’cause you’re so nice.\c\nIt’s not doing me any good anyway.\nReally.
Sometimes I wonder if it really is only a dirty old bottle.\c\nThose last words that the old guy said as he left...\n“[VAR COLOR(0002)]For a mere three days will Hoopa be unbound[VAR COLOR(0000)]...”\r\nJust can’t seem to get that out of my head...
Oh... You’re that kid from that time...
What did you end up doing with that old bottle?\nThough...I guess it doesn’t matter anymore. Really.\c\nIt’s just, even now, it’s still bugging me, you know?\n“[VAR COLOR(0002)]For a mere three days will Hoopa be unbound[VAR COLOR(0000)]...”\r\nThat’s what he said. I just can’t seem to forget it...

Please, just a moment, mon chou!\nI need you to attendez!
Do forgive us, young m[VAR GENDBR(00FF,0705)]asteristress,\nfor speaking without an introduction.\c\nThere is a matter of great import\nthat we must discuss.\c\nIs it true that you have somehow\nobtained the Mythical Pokémon Diancie?
Diancie...\c\nThe inexplicable mutation arising from\nthe Pokémon we know as Carbink...\c\nWhen and where it originates from,\nand the mécanisme of its formation...\c\nIt is indeed a mystérieuse existence,\none of des plus grands mystères!
Diancie is the epitome of\nbeauty among Pokémon.\c\nThe divine symmetry of its\nbody enables it to absorb light\r\nand display a radiance beyond\r\nthe awareness of this realm.\c\nIt is said that, upon Mega Evolving,\nMega Diancie emanates a beauty\r\nthat surpasses all known beauty.
That beauty... It is so dazzling to behold that\npeople call it the “Royal Pink Princess.”\c\nOur jeune maître—young master—has been searching\nfor Diancie in order to see this beauty fantastique.\c\nAnd we two have managed to obtain the Diancite\nthat is nécessaire for its Mega Evolution.\c\nWe have been most ardent to discover a Diancie\nthat we might take back to our young master,\r\nto show to him this famed beauté ultime.\c\nYet we have proved unsuitable to the task,\nunable to secure the indispensable Diancie!
Please allow me to\nask you directly...\c\nWill you agree to relinquish\nyour Diancie to us?
No way!
All right...
Is there no way we\ncan persuade you?
Mon chou, please...\nIf you could only...
Vraiment? You will?\c\nOh, what a relief to have met\nwith a Trainer so understanding!\c\nThen...
...Wait.
M-master?!
Hey, I’m sorry they’ve\nbeen bugging you.
Um, you guys...\c\nI’m really glad you tried so hard to\nfind a Diancie for me. Truly.\c\nBut...\nWell, I think you might be on the wrong track.
I’m not even that into finding a\nDiancie anymore, you know.\c\nWhat I really want now is a big,\ntough Pokémon—you know?
So, you’ve got a Diancie, right?\c\nHow about we give you the Diancite we found?\c\nIt’d be a crazy waste to have a rare Pokémon like\nthat and never even Mega Evolve it. You know?
That’s what you gotta do, am I right?\c\nMega Evolve them like bam! And then...\nPow! Pow! And end that battle in a flash!\c\nEven if folks do call it a royal pink whatever,\nI bet a Mega Evolved Diancie would be\r\ncrazy strong! Who knows?\c\nYou keep rolling your way through battles\nand strolling away with victories!\r\nThat’s what I wanna see, you know!
OK, you two!\nNow let’s shoot for a big, tough Pokémon!
Ohoho...\nMon jeune maître...

Have you delivered that letter yet?\c\nOr were you meaning to sail back Petalburg way, maybe?
To Petalburg and environs! Anchors aweigh!\c\nPeeko, we’re setting sail, my darling!
Then you go on and deliver that letter. I have the deck.\c\nIf you’re ever feeling lost and adrift though, try calling in\non the island’s Pokémon Gym.\c\nThe Leader, Brawly, surely knows about everything that\ngoes on here in his town!
Ahoy! We’ve hit land in Dewford!\c\nYou just go on and tell me whenever\nyou want to set sail again, la[VAR GENDBR(00FF,0201)]dss!
Ahoy! We’ll lift anchor anytime for you!\nSo tell me, my friend, where are we bound?
Petalburg City, or thereabouts? Anchors aweigh!\c\nPeeko, we’re setting sail, my darling!
Slateport City, is it? Anchors aweigh!\c\nPeeko, we’re setting sail, my darling!
Just tell me whenever you\nwant to hoist anchor again.
Route 104 (near Petalburg)
Head to Dewford
Route 109 (near Slateport)
Never mind
Ahoy! We’ve made land in Slateport!\c\nI suppose you’re off to visit Captain Stern\nand deliver those Devon Parts?
Aren’t you about delivering those Devon Parts?\c\nOr were you meaning to sail back to Dewford?
Dewford it is, then! Anchors aweigh!\c\nPeeko, we’re setting sail, my darling!
Then you go on and deliver those Devon Parts.\nI’ll wait till all’s blue.
Ahoy! We’ve hit land in Slateport!\c\nYou go on and tell me if-an’-ever\nyou want to set sail again, la[VAR GENDBR(00FF,0201)]dss!
[~ 18]
You just tell me if-an’-ever\nyou need to set sail again!
Hold on, lass!\nBelay that, Peeko!
Oh, if it ain’t [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\nYou’re the one who saved my Peeko!\r\nAye, but we owe you for that day!\c\nWhat’s that? You want to sail with me?\c\nWhat’s this all about, then?\c\nA letter bound for Dewford?\nCertainly, that’d be no problem at all.\c\nYou’ve come to the right man!\nShall we hoist sail for Dewford at once?

Your delivery can wait?\nYou’re one to gaff off!\c\nYou just go on and tell me whenever you\nwant to set sail.
Ahoy! I know exactly what you want to say!\c\nYou’re to deliver that letter to Dewford, or\nain’t that so?\c\nYou’ve come to the right man if that’s the case!\nShall we hoist anchor for Dewford first?
Ahoy! I know exactly what you want to say!\c\nYou’ve still got to deliver that case to\nyoung Stern in Slateport. Ain’t that so?\c\nYou just leave it up to this old seadog!\nWeigh anchors! We’re for Slateport today!
Ahoy! We’ll lift anchor anytime for you!\nSo tell me, my friend, where are we bound?
You sure about that?\nWell, Peeko owes her life to you, la[VAR GENDBR(00FF,0201)]dss.\c\nYou just go on and tell me anytime you\nwant to set sail. I’ll brave any tide for you!
[~ 29]
Oho! It looks as though you have delivered your chit\ngood and proper.\c\nAh, but that reminds me! I’ve had a message from\nPresident Stone, saying he has another favor to ask.\c\nIt’s about them [VAR COLOR(0002)]Devon Parts [VAR COLOR(0000)]that you recovered for\nhim before.\c\nSeems as though they should go to some fellow called\n[VAR COLOR(0002)]Stern[VAR COLOR(0000)] at [VAR COLOR(0002)]Slateport’s shipyard[VAR COLOR(0000)].\c\nThis old seadog will see you there safely!\nWeigh anchors!

...\nLooks like I won’t be needing THIS...\c\nHiyyup!
Phew!\c\nThat’s sooo much better!\nOoooh, I feel so free!\c\nThat uniform got pretty stinky\nafter a while! And all sweaty, too!
Murrrm!
Ohhh, my adorable little Aster! \c\nAre you that happy to see me looking\nlike myself again, hmm? \c\nAhhh, you’re just too darned cute!\nLike always!
Phew.
But there’s not much\ntime left for us.\c\nIt’ll only be a matter\nof weeks...\c\n...No.\c\nDays.
Things have gotten a bit tricky now,\nsince that kid managed to stop one\r\nof the super-ancient Pokémon from\r\nbeing revived like it should’ve been.
Not that it’s a really big deal.\nI’ve already thought of a new plan.\c\nIf I just tweak a bit with a Key Stone,\none with plenty of THAT built up...
Whisss...
I swear I’ll protect you.\c\n...Aster.
...
See that, Aster?\nYou always wanted to watch them, right?\c\nThe Litleonids.\nA million glittering stars falling from the sky...\c\nThe show is about to start.
Mur! Murrr!
Aren’t we happy now?\nYes, what could be better, dear Aster? Ha ha...
...\c\nWelcome to the Dragonhark altar.\c\n[VAR TRNAME(0000)].\c\nYou know what I am trying to do here\nby now, don’t you?
Ever since I was a little girl, I have\nalways turned my eyes up to the sky.\c\nWhen I was so full of uncertainty that\nI felt my heart might be crushed by it...\c\nWhen I was so grief-stricken and alone\nI thought my heart might break of it...
What about you?\nHave you ever had to do something like that?
I have.
Never.
Right...
Ahaha! You’re just too honest!\c\nDon’t you know that you’re supposed to agree,\nand then we’d share a touching moment of pain?
...\c\nI used to watch the stars\nlike this all the time...\r\nTogether with Aster.\c\nWe were always together.\nIn good times and in bad.
But I still lost her.
...\c\nHahaha...\c\n...\c\nI want to see her...\c\nI want to be with her again...\c\nMy sweet Aster...
Mum...?
I will, won’t I?\c\nWith this...\c\nJust a little longer...
Mur, mur!
Guess I should say good morning?
You slept well, didn’t you?\c\nYou look so adorable when you sleep.\nSorry about the knocking-you-out thing.
...\c\nEnough.\c\nI think it’s time I\ngave it a shot.
I’m sorry...for all the\ntrouble I caused you.\c\nIf something happens\nto me...\c\nPlease...\nTake this little one...
...\c\n...\c\n...OK.\c\nHere I go.
“With jewel bright and borrowed might\nfrom the spirits of the departed...”
“Through sacred rite, in thy great sight,\nmy life as well I offer...”
The Key Stones that Zinnia holds\nare giving off a blinding light!
...Ugh...ngh...gh...
“I summon thee...to aid...this fight...\nand save us...from disaster!”
Kiryararararahhh!!!
!!!
Kiryarassshhhaaahhh!
Ray...quaza!
I did it!\nI...I did it!
Now the world...will be saved!\nAster... Aster, I did it!
Great Rayquaza!\nHear my wish!\c\nAchieve your Mega Evolution!\nTake hold of your true power!\c\nShow me your true face!\nThe Rayquaza that will save this planet!
...\c\n...\c\n...\c\nZinnia’s Key Stone does not react...
Huh?!
H-how can this be?!
I gathered all of the Key Stones that\ncould withstand your great power...\r\nand summoned you here...\r\nYou came...
And yet...\nWhy?!
Come on! Do it!\nMega Evolve!\c\nWhy?! Why won’t you...
...\c\n...\c\nZinnia’s Key Stone does not react...
Kirrrurrrurrr...
What?!
It can’t be...\c\nThe one without enough\npower...is you, Rayquaza?
The Meteorites that should lie within\nRayquaza’s great body...aren’t enough?\c\nHave these thousand years drained them\nof their power?
This...can’t...be...
I can’t...
I... I...\nEverything...I’ve done...till now...
Aster...\c\nI can’t...\nI can’t take any...more...
...
[VAR TRNAME(0000)]’s [VAR BD00(0007,0000,0000)]Meteorite[VAR BD01] suddenly began to glow!
That’s—?!
The glow of [VAR TRNAME(0000)]’s [VAR BD00(0007,0000,0000)]Meteorite[VAR BD01]\ngrew even stronger!
What?\nThat Meteorite?!
It’s just like...a Mega Stone?!
Kiryarararaaahhh!!!
Rayquaza swallowed [VAR TRNAME(0000)]’s [VAR BD00(0007,0000,0000)]Meteorite[VAR BD01]!
Kirrrihrrrihrrrihhhh!!!
Light is spilling forth from within\nRayquaza’s body!
Whoa!!!
Swallowing meteorites allows it to store as\nmuch power as a Mega Stone.\c\nYour Meteorite summoned forth the power\nneeded for Rayquaza to Mega Evolve!
Kirrrihrrrihrrriii!!!
Hah!\nIt’s amazing!
[VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\c\nRayquaza is trying to build up power...\nIt wants power for itself to take you on!\c\nUse everything you’ve got and win over\nRayquaza! You have to master it!
If you need a Poké Ball, I’ve got one!
Kiiiryarrrarrrarrrraaaashiiiii!!!
Is it...over?
Murrrrrr!
...\nCongratulations, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].\r\nAnd...thank you.
History has chosen you...\c\nThe truth remains that Rayquaza\nchose you and not me...\c\nBut...\c\nWhile I don’t know how to put\nit into words exactly...\r\nI think I understand why...
...You will be successor\nto our long history now.\c\nAnd I pass to you the final\nkey to Rayquaza’s true power.\c\nThe move that only it can\nlearn: [VAR COLOR(0002)]Dragon Ascent[VAR COLOR(0000)]...
[VAR PKNICK(0001)] succeeded to\nthe power of Dragon Ascent!
...That’s it, then.
I guess...it’s time that I do\nmy last task as Lorekeeper.
You have obtained Rayquaza’s\npower for your own...\c\nNow I will have you prove to me\nthat you can master that power...\r\nin battle!\c\nThat is my final...\c\nThe final duty of the last\nLorekeeper of the Draconid people!
Show me that you can exceed it—the entirety\nof history that we have clung to until today!
...Phew.
...

So you came for me.\nThanks for that.
That’s really good, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].\nI really feel it, right here.
That’s really good, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].\nI really feel it, right here.
Mm-hmm...
Since you’ve been a good boy, I think\nI’ll give you something I’ve been keeping.
Since you’ve been a good girl, I think\nI’ll give you something I’ve been keeping.
Look...\c\nThe paintings that cover the walls of this tower...\c\nSee, these are the history of humanity, of Pokémon,\nand of nature itself.\c\nThey’re the tales that have been passed down by my\nancestors, the Draconids, for thousands of years.\c\nAnd now...I will pass that history and lore on to you.
Thousands of years ago, in the primal age long lost,\nthe world was overflowing with natural energy.\c\nPrimal Groudon and Primal Kyogre fought\nover that energy in endless, furious clashes.
In the face of Primal Groudon and Kyogre’s great power,\npeople could do nothing.\c\nThe only choice was to watch as disaster upon\ndisaster swept over them.
It was in such a time that a great many meteoroids\npoured from the darkness of space, from a place\r\nhigher even than the heavens.\c\nAnd the meteoroids fell in their multitude upon\na waterfall that had long been home to a\r\ntribe of Dragon-type-Pokémon users...
...OK! That’s it!\c\nThat’s the end of the first chapter of my tale.
I’ll tell you the next part of the story\non the next floor. Look forward to it!
Oh! Here you are!
Let me continue.\c\nIt’s finally time for chapter two.\nHere we go!
At last, right?\nHah! I know you’re thrilled.
The meteors shone with a rainbow brilliance, as if some\ngreat life was held within.
That was when, as if drawn by the brilliance, a Pokémon\nthat shone in a blazing emerald hue descended from\r\nthe heavens...\c\nThat Pokémon was none other than Rayquaza.
Rayquaza’s power overwhelmed that of the two\nPrimal Pokémon, and peace returned to the world.\c\nThe people of Hoenn revered Rayquaza as a true savior.
A thousand years after this time, the meteoroids once\nagain fell.\c\nA huge meteoroid, far greater than any before,\nstruck the planet, boring deep into the ocean\r\nand leaving behind it a crater larger than any other.\c\nThe land born of this event later become known\nas Sootopolis.
And that is it!\nChapter two is over!
But we’ve only just left the starting line.\nThere’s a long way yet—don’t fall behind now!
Now, our tale reaches the best part.\c\nSootopolis was born from a great meteoroid strike.
The great meteoroid was the first of many disasters to\nbefall humanity.\c\nWhen it punched into the planet, the land cracked\nbeneath it, and a great welling of natural energy\r\npoured from beneath Hoenn.\c\nThirsting for that energy, Primal Kyogre and\nPrimal Groudon once again woke.
The people had a wish—a memory\nfrom a thousand years before...\c\nThey wished that the Legendary Pokémon\nclad in emerald light would appear again.\c\nThe huge Meteorite that lay at the heart of\nSootopolis gave off a boundless brilliance.\c\nIn its brilliance, it resembled a vast and\npowerful Key Stone.\c\nAnd once again, Rayquaza descended\nfrom whence it came in the heavens.
The people fell to their knees before\nRayquaza and made a wish for salvation.\c\nAs they did, a great change came\nover the Legendary Pokémon.\c\nIt was enveloped in blinding light.\nAs the light receded, they beheld\r\na Rayquaza beyond all knowledge—\r\na sublime figure, incandescent\r\nwith overwhelming life force.
It was humanity’s wish that brought about\nRayquaza’s transformation in the face of\r\nthe rainbow stone...\c\nYes... A wish...\nAn intangible thing, invisible to the eye.\c\nYet this wish bound people and Pokémon\ntogether, enabling the Legendary\r\nPokémon to change its appearance...\c\nDoesn’t it remind you of something?\c\nThat’s right...\nIt sounds like Mega Evolution, doesn’t it?
And how did the story end?\c\nAfter being transformed by the wish of the\npeople, did Rayquaza save them from disaster?
Rayquaza once again confronted Primal Groudon and\nPrimal Kyogre.\c\nThe golden filaments that sprang from its body covered\nthe sky.\c\nAn emerald brilliance illuminated the area.\nA terrible wind rose.
The wind and emerald light visibly sapped the power from\nPrimal Groudon and Primal Kyogre.\c\nDrained of their primal powers, the two vanished into the\ndepths of land and sea.\c\nRayquaza watched them go, regaining its\nusual appearance.\c\nThen it soared back up into the heavens where\nit dwelled.\c\nA witness to this series of events, a tall visitor from a\ndistant land, said, “It is the Δ (Delta), born of the great\r\ndisturbances in this world.”\c\n“By the bonds born of mankind’s wish and the power\nof the stones, it will calm the troubles that plague\r\nthe world.”
That was when the Draconids constructed their\ngreat tower, to hold the rainbow stone that had\r\ngranted Rayquaza its power, and to try to get a\r\nlittle bit closer to Rayquaza in the heavens above.\c\nTo record the history of their trials and the great feats\nof mighty Rayquaza for all to know, they left\r\nbehind the murals you see here.
A giant tower...\nAnd paintings of the past...\c\nYou know, I feel like I’ve seen something like\nthat recently.\c\nHeh. But now, I suppose it’s time for the last chapter\nin our tale.
At last we reach the final chapter...
A thousand years of peace followed after\nthat disastrous time.\c\nBut the Draconid people, learning from\ntheir long history’s cyclical nature, foretold\r\nthat the meteoroids would fall on this land again.\c\nThe meteoroid to come, they prophesized, would\nbe far greater than those that had come before it.\c\nThis meteoroid would be great enough to break\nthe world forever...
In order to prevent this great calamity, those who held\nthe knowledge of the past arrived at a plan.\c\nTheir plan was to invoke Rayquaza, the great savior,\nand summon it to this land before the meteoroid\r\ncould strike.
And that’s it.\c\nThat’s the end of our...\nof the Draconids’ tale.
I spent a long time thinking about\nhow I could protect the happiness\r\nof as many people as possible.\c\nWhat I must do, as one who holds both\nthe knowledge and the power...\c\nOne who bears the heavy wishes of those\nwho could not...live up to that fate...\c\nWell, I had to be really creative, you know?

Uwaahhh!
This conversation isn’t proceeding as expected!
Ugh...
If it has come to this, then I, Tabitha,\nshall handle this myself!
Courtney!
Y-yes?!
Apologize to Leader Maxie!
Hu-huh?!\nOw...ch...
Hurry up! OK?!\nJust say, “Sorry!”
I’m sorry!\nLeader Maxie, I’m sorry!\c\nI won’t do it...anymore!\nI’ll never do anything...like that...again!
So please...\nForgive... Forgive me.
?!
Wah...wah...\nSniffle...
What are you—?!
Sniff...sniffle...\nOhh...ooh...
...\c\n...\c\nFine.
I understand.
Courtney.\c\nI, the great Maxie,\nwill forgive you.
But only on one condition!
Huh?!

You must...also forgive me.
Courtney.\nI never imagined...\r\nI never could have imagined...
How very loyal you were to me.\c\nNor did I imagine even one iota of\nthe shock you must have experienced,\r\ndue to my recent speech and conduct,\r\nor how it could have pained you.\c\nThe one who drove you to such\nan extreme act was me.\r\nI am truly sorry for that.
You see, Courtney,\c\nI would like to start on a new path.\c\nThere are truths that I\nhave learned because of\r\nthe mistakes I have made.\c\nThey pit me against others\nwho are not like me and\r\nagainst ideas that differ from mine.\c\nThey tell me the importance of\nunderstanding these others,\r\neven though we may continue\r\nto cause pain to one another.\c\nAnd that holds true whether the\nopponent I face is human, Pokémon,\r\nor even the might of nature itself.\c\nI will take this step forward, free\nfrom hesitation, and meet my foe.\c\nAnd together we will find a way to\ncreate, not destroy. Or so I hope.\c\nThat is the vision that I, Maxie,\nhave for Team Magma’s future.
Will you come with me\non this journey as well?\r\nCourtney.
Wahh... Uwahh... Waahhh!\nWaahhh... Of course I will!
My...\nYou certainly do cry a lot.

Who am I?\c\nThat’s a surprisingly\ndifficult question.

Haha! Whatever, right?\c\nEnough with the introspection\nand the soul searching...
You there! [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\nDon’t just stand there like a stick in the mud.\r\nCome on over and say hi.

Oops. But looks like [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0100)]she’s a bit too late this time.\nIf only you’d been here just one minute earlier!
Zinnia snatched the Key Stone\naway from Maxie!
You—?!
Le-leader?!
All right.\nI’d say this Key Stone is mine.
We finally got everything, Aster.
Murrr?
Now we can do it: The summoning.
We will summon Rayquaza!
Well then, looks like my job here is done.\nSo don’t mind me while I excuse myself.
Oh. [VAR TRNAME(0000)]?
I really hope you’ll come chasing\nafter me, you know?\c\nWe’ll be heading to that ancient\ntower, sealed since primal times,\r\nthe [VAR COLOR(0002)]Sky Pillar[VAR COLOR(0000)].

See you there!
Murrr!
Wh-wh-wh-wh—\nWhat is going on here?!\c\nWho does she think she is, messing up\nour base and then giving us the slip?!\c\nThat can never be forgiven!
...
Now I see...
Yes, it was not chance that brought\nyou here now. This was inevitable.
Leader?
Tabitha.\nGive it to him.
Tabitha.\nGive it to her.
What did you say?!\nI-is that all right?!
Yes...\c\nNow that the Key Stone has been stolen,\na Mega Stone will serve me no purpose.
Acknowledged.
Cameruptite.\c\nMake sure your Camerupt\nholds on to it tightly.
I do not have the power now\nto use Mega Evolution.\c\nSo I entrust it to you.\c\nI entrust it believing that this is\nthe best action I can now take!
That woman...\c\nShe had such utter mastery over her\nDragon-type Pokémon.\r\nThere is more to her than meets the eye.
I do not know what must be\ngoing through her mind.\c\nBut...I think you may be the only one\nwho can now stand against her.\c\nSo I ask you this favor:\nRage! Take up this fight for me, and\r\nbring this crisis to its resolution!

Honestly, making a fresh start\nis too much of a bother and hard.\c\nBut if all of us work together,\nwe might be able to make it.\c\nTeam Magma is the team that\nmakes me feel that way.

The file folder holds a stack of ragged papers.\c\n“Official Statem— of Apolog—”\n“I, —izo— Co—mo, am respon—\r\nfor the los— of the [VAR COLOR(0002)]Odd Keystone[VAR COLOR(0000)]\r\ndona—d...by the Oreb—gh Mine...”\c\nThe rest is too damaged to make out...
It’s covered with different knickknacks, all\nfeaturing a Skitty in some kind of dress...\r\nBut they’re all pretty dusty!
In the dusty bookcase are old papers covered in\ndetailed statements and records of payments made.\c\nThe text is blurred in places and hard to read.\c\n“Sea—ville...servi—nvoice...\nName: Ra— Coz—o\r\nBase—ay: $—85—9\r\nOvertim—bursement: $1—23”\c\nThe rest is too damaged to make out.
These shelves look like they\nmight fall apart at any moment.\c\nThere’s an old game system\nwith two screens...\c\nSomething about it is different\nfrom the system you have...
Oh! A Hi Skitty doll... Isn’t it cute?\nI remember when these were all the rage...\c\nBut I wonder why it’s here...\nWasn’t this an office?
There are a number of letters in this rusting tin box.\c\nWould you like to read them?

No thanks
“Dear Daddy,\c\nHow are you?\nAre you working really hard?\c\nI’m doing well.\c\nI’m doing all my homework,\nand I’m helping at home, too.\c\nMommy’s working hard and\nmakes us dinner every night.\c\nDo you have to work this weekend?\nAre you going to come home?\c\nIf you come home, take me to\nsee the star show, OK?\c\n                             —Takao Cozmo\c\nP.S. I’m going to send you the\npicture I drew at the Trainers’ School.”
It looked like another letter, but it’s a drawing.\c\nThe drawing is of a boy’s face, and written next\nto it are the words “I love you, Daddy.”
“Dear Daddy,\c\nHow are you?\nAre you working really hard?\c\nI was sad that you didn’t come\nlast weekend.\c\nBut Mommy didn’t seem so sad.\nShe went out with her friend.\c\nI finally got that telescope that\nI’ve been wanting.\c\nIt was from you, wasn’t it?\nThanks, Daddy. I really, really wanted it.\c\nI like looking at the sky, Daddy.\c\nWhen I look at the stars, I wonder if\nyou are looking at the same stars, too.\c\nLet’s look at the stars together, next\ntime you come home.\c\n                             —Takao Cozmo”
“Dear Daddy,\c\nHow are you?\nYou aren’t working too hard, are you?\c\nYou never come home anymore.\nI’m worried if you’re OK.\c\nMommy goes out with her friends a lot.\nIt seems like fun, so I guess she’s doing OK.\c\nThe Shelgon that you gave me evolved the\nother day.\c\nBut I liked it better when it was a Shelgon\nand it looked like a Meteorite.\c\nSalamence was kind of a letdown, so\nI asked a friend to trade it for his Solrock.\c\nI’m sorry, Daddy. I know it was a present,\nbut I think Solrock is cooler.\c\nWhen it gets dark tonight, I’m going to look\nat the stars again. I’ll think of you when I do.\c\n                             —Takao Cozmo”
“Dear Daddy,\c\nI was really, really happy to get to\nmeet you the other day.\c\nIt was so fun playing together again,\nand going to see the star show, too,\r\neven if it was just the two of us.\c\nIt was sad that Mommy couldn’t go,\nand even more sad when you and\r\nMommy fought that night.\c\nI’ll study hard, just like you told me,\nand I’ll be a good boy, so don’t fight.\c\nBut let me keep watching the stars,\neven if I have to do all my homework, too.\c\nWhen I grow up, I want to be a professor\nand study the stars.\c\n                             —Takao Cozmo”
“Dear Daddy,\nThank you for writing to me.\c\nI’m doing really well here,\nso please don’t worry about me.\c\nI hope I’ll see you again someday.\nI dream about it all the time.\c\nI brought the telescope you\nbought me to our new house.\c\nPlease don’t work too hard, Daddy.\nI hope you are OK.\c\nI will always, always love the stars,\nand I will always, always love you.\c\n                             —Takao Cozmo\c\nP.S. I’ll give you my Hi Skitty doll.\nPlease take care of it for me.”
It looked like another letter, but it’s a photo.\c\nThere’s a little boy holding a telescope,\nwith a woman beside him, looking bored.
Want to read another letter?
It’s a tattered clipping from an old magazine cover.\nOn the cover is a young lady who looks like Lisia.\c\n“Termination of New Mauville Project\nOfficially Announced at Last!\r\nSerious Talks Begin about the\r\nClosure of Sea Mauville!\r\nCries of Concern Erupt from Staff\r\nMembers Working at Sea Mauville!\r\nGreater Mauville Holdings Reps Remain\r\nTight-Lipped about the Issues!\c\nProject Leader Wattson Weighs In\non Problems Plaguing New Mauville!”\c\nThe rest of the magazine has been\ntorn away...
...
It’s a card that has mold growing on it.\c\n“Sea Mauville Employee ID\nGroup Leader Stern\r\nExcavation Unit No. 8 (Team I)”
It’s an old, hide-bound notebook.\c\n“The damage caused by the cancellation of the\nNew Mauville project has been catastrophic.\c\nAs a member of the management, much of the blame\nand the debts will fall upon me.\c\nBut that will be little consolation to the employees\nworking under me who will lose their livelihoods.\c\nI couldn’t do a thing for them...\nI’m a man with no power...\c\nProtecting nature and Pokémon and the environment...\nIt’s great as an idea. It’s a fine ideal to aspire to.\r\nAnd Wattson is a great man for dreaming of it all.\c\nBut cruel reality and the organization that I must\ntry to preserve have dashed those dreams.\c\nI couldn’t do a thing for him...\nI’m a man with no power...”\c\nThis is the last page with writing on it.\nOther pages have been torn out.
There are dirty papers inside the cabinet...\c\n“Sea Mau—nal Newsletter #389\c\nWe ha— a new winne—he monthly slogan—mpetition!\nIt’s—alty—the lea—Storage Unit No. 1— ith—\r\nDon’t dirty the seas with pollution and dumping!\r\nDirty your uniform with sweat and hard work!\c\nIn recog—of his win, Cap’n Sal—will—ceive a\nRocky—met and—yperior!\c\n—everyone will kee—slogan in the—hearts\nand—as they giv—re all again—s month!”
It’s a mattress with springs poking out of it.\nThere’s something underneath it...\c\nIt’s an old-looking magazine of some kind.\n“Captivating Landscapes from around the World!”
It’s an odd-smelling mattress.\nThere’s something underneath it...\c\nIt’s a torn magazine of some kind.\n“Rugged Vehicles from around the World!”
It’s a bed with ragged sheets.\nThere’s something underneath it...\c\nIt’s a torn magazine of some kind.\n“What You Need to Know about Unemployment”
It’s a bed that seems to have been chewed on.\nThere’s something underneath it...\c\nIt’s a colorful magazine of some kind.\n“The Fame and the Shame! Champions Exposed!”
The locker’s handle has broken off.\nIt’s so rusted that it doesn’t even budge...
It feels as though you’re being watched...
There are little glass bottles lined up inside a dusty\ncabinet, all with the same label...\c\n“Wake Up with Devon Energy Elixir!\nNow with Refined Seviper Extract!\r\nIncrease your Focus! Work for Days!\r\nYou’ll Never Need Another Rest!”
Shahhh!

Places like this are rare, so I’m\ntaking a good look around.\c\nHmm-hmm-hmm...\nThere appear to be other rooms...
It’s a filing cabinet whose glass has been broken.\c\nHuh?\nThere’s a key hanging at the back.
It’s a file cabinet with broken glass.\nThere’s nothing important.
It’s a cabinet covered with dust.\nGrass is growing from an opened drawer.
Wha— How in the world did you get in?\nI locked the door...\c\nAll right. You want this, don’t you?\nTake this!
I was teaching this girl how\nhard it is to be a Trainer!
...Blush...
There’s an old note at the back of the cabinet\nwith broken glass.\c\n“Finally, the date of closing has been decided.\nI can’t say thank you enough to Stern, who invited us\r\nto his shipyard when we would have been left adrift.\c\nDock, who’s done a dirty job, and I can\nboth start with a clean slate.\r\nThe only way we can repay him is to support\r\nhis business with our skills.”
There’s a crumpled piece of paper inside.\n“Sea Mauville Company Song” is written on it.\c\n1. The daybreak shines on Route 108.\nWake up, our towering fort.\r\nFor the bright future Hoenn,\r\nWe won’t take our days off.\r\nDig through, dig out great energy.\r\nAh, Sea Mauville, Sea Mauville, Sea Mauville.\c\n2. The bright light shines on Route 108.\nIntensely shiny, our fort.\r\nSwear your selfless devotion.\r\nUnionization is out of the question.\r\nDig through, dig out great energy.\r\nAh, Sea Mauville, Sea Mauville, Sea Mauville.\c\n3. Darkness descends on Route 108.\nTonight again sleepless, our fort.\r\nDrive away our competitors.\r\nWe won’t take our overtime pay.\r\nDig through, dig out great energy.\r\nAh, Sea Mauville, Sea Mauville, Sea Mauville.
It’s a group photo of people in jumpsuits.\nThey’re all tanned, each striking a pose.
It’s a picture of a guy with an impressive mustache\nand stomach. He’s smiling with many men in\r\njumpsuits in front of Sea Mauville.

A ragged jumpsuit is hung in the locker.\nPokémon may have gnawed on it.
It’s an old shelf.\c\nA shattered tea cup with printed letters “Adversity”\nis on the shelf.
There is a gigantic PC behind the\nlocker that doesn’t open.\c\nMoss is growing from the broken monitor.
A card is on the chair with warped legs.\nSome parts are missing.\c\nSea Mauv—e Employee I— C—rd\n—a— —z—\r\nWare— team R, Storage Group —1
A pick is resting against an old machine...\c\nIt’s huge like a horn of a Heracross,\nbut it’s very rusty.
There’s a locker with a very dented door.\nWhether you push it or pull it, it won’t move.
A lot of tattered comic books are piled high.\nWhen did they read these?

Isn’t this place fun?\nI get chills just being here!\c\nAnd there are rumors about an\nawesome Pokémon living here!
Sniff, sniff...\c\nJust as I thought, a rare Pokémon must be\nhiding somewhere in this abandoned building.\c\nGirls are very sensitive to smell, so I know.
When I was young, I worked here.\c\nEven though it was closed for Pokémon’s sake,\nlooking at my old workplace deteriorating like\r\nthis gives me mixed feelings.
Ah...\nI can’t go farther...\c\nIf my Pokémon knows the move [VAR COLOR(0002)]Dive[VAR COLOR(0000)],\nI might be able to go farther.
Oh!\nYou have Dive!\c\nI have my inner tube,\nso I can’t dive. Ahaha.
Oh!\nYou have Dive!\c\nI have my inner tube,\nso I can’t dive. Ahaha.
The door is locked.\c\nIt has “Room 1” written on it.
The door is locked.\c\nIt has “Room 2” written on it.
The door is locked.\c\nIt has “Room 4” written on it.
The door is locked.\c\nIt has “Room 6” written on it.
[VAR TRNAME(0000)] used the\n[VAR ITEM2(0001)]!\c\nThe key stuck fast in the keyhole,\nbut the door opened!
Hey!\nLittle kid over there!
I came here ’cause my uncle told me\nthat there are extraordinary treasures\r\nin this abandoned building.\c\nDon’t you know anything about them?\c\nWell, how would you know...\c\nBut if you learn anything, tell me,\nkid. Understand?
I wonder how extraordinary the\nextraordinary treasures are.\c\nHehehe...\nI’m excited like a kid in a candy store.
It’s a perfect place for exploration,\nso I’m really excited!\c\nRumor has it that there are awesome\ntreasures here!
I don’t know what it is for,\nbut I found a key!\c\nI don’t know what it is for,\nbut do you want this?
Here it is!
Don’t be shy.\nTake this!
I wonder what the key is for. It’s exciting.\nIf you find out, please let me know.
So that was the Key to Room 1!\nI couldn’t read what was written on it.\c\nOnce you find out what it is,\nit’s a tad disappointing, isn’t it?\c\nGive me back the excitement!
I heard this place used to collect\nsomething called e-n-e-r-g-y.
Sniff, sniff... Yes, yes! I can smell it.\c\nYou must have met or caught a rare\nPokémon around here, right?\c\nBut this smell...\nIt’s different from the smell of any\r\nPokémon in the Hoenn region.
There is a worn-out sign.\c\nSea Mauville’s 10 slogans for\na cheerful and fun workplace.\c\n01. Say good morning very loudly.\c\n02. Don’t bring Pokémon to your workplace.\c\n03. Always arrive on time. Always stay late.\c\n04. Lay your life on the line in safety checks.\c\n05. Take joint responsibility for teamwork.\c\n06. Obey your superior’s orders absolutely.\c\n07. Maintain top quality. Give up your sanity.\c\n08. Worship and praise the founder.\c\n09. Don’t expect time off before you retire.\c\n10. No need to think. Just work unceasingly.

The [VAR ITEM2(0000)] in your Bag\nseems to be glowing faintly...
I’m investigating this place Sea Mauville at\nCaptain Stern’s request.\c\nHe wanted me to look for a [VAR COLOR(0002)]Scanner[VAR COLOR(0000)] while I’m here,\nbut I haven’t found anything like that.\c\nI suppose the only place I haven’t checked yet is that\nlowest room you can only reach by diving underwater.\r\nBut I just hate having the water close over my head...
Ahhh! Is that the Scanner?\c\nHmm... Do you think you could\ndeliver it to Captain Stern?\c\nI still have things I want to inspect\nwhile I’m here.
You delivered that Scanner for me!\nThanks again!\c\nI heard about it from Captain Stern.\nHe just contacted me a little while ago.\c\nIt seems that when he checked the data\non the Scanner, he got high-energy readings\r\nnever seen in the Pokémon native to Hoenn!\c\nI’m not sure what it all means, but it sure\nis exciting! The thrill of research!
The door is locked.\c\nIt has “Storage” written on it.
[VAR TRNAME(0000)] used the Storage Key!\c\nThe key stuck fast in the keyhole,\nbut the door opened!
...Hm?\c\nYou want something?
Mmm...\nIt’s just not going at all.
Mmm...\nHaven’t caught any Pokémon.\r\nBut I guess I did catch this...
Mmm...\nI guess I’m not really waiting for a bite...\c\nIt’s really that I love times like this,\nout fishing on my own...
How’s it going?
You caught anything?
[~ 13]
Oh my, are you a tourist?\c\nI am a member of the nature preservation\nsociety that manages this site.
Is there anything you would like me\nto tell you about Sea Mauville?
This place was once a facility built to extract\nnatural resources that can be found in the ocean.\c\nHowever, a certain event led to the facility’s closure.\c\nNormally you would expect that an unnecessary\nfacility like this one would be torn down.\c\nBut an environmental survey carried out before\nnew construction led to the awareness that a\r\nunique environment had risen here at Sea Mauville.\c\nAs a result, the demolition plans were shelved,\nand this space was reborn as a Nature Preserve.
The most easily recognizable feature of Sea Mauville is\nthis building, which now tilts precariously into the sea.\c\nAfter being exposed to the elements for so long, the\nbuilding’s support structures weathered and corroded,\r\nultimately leaving the building in its current state.\c\nPlease be careful where you step as you experience\nfor yourself the awesome power of nature.\c\nAlso note the mangroves growing in this area.\nThey are extremely rare trees and can only be found\r\nhere and around Mossdeep City.\c\nLastly, I would like to point out the interior of the building\nhas been largely untouched in the decades following\r\nSea Mauville’s closure—a fact that most of our visitors\r\ndelight to experience.
Thank you very much.\c\nWe are also fundraising for the\npreservation of Sea Mauville.\c\nOur request is $100 per visitor.\nCan we count on your support?
Thank you very much, and we hope you will\ncontinue to support our efforts in the future.
...\c\nWe really hope we may look forward\nto your support in the future.
What is this place?
What is there to do?
I’m good.
Sea Mauville\nA Hoenn Region Protected Area
Muhuhuhu... Good, good. I like it—I really do.\nThis atmosphere, like it’s been forgotten in time...
I’m here surveying Sea Mauville at the request of\nCaptain Stern.
A mysterious ring is floating in the air.\c\nA mystical presence seems to be lurking within it...\c\nWould you like to examine it?

Are you planning on going deep\nin there?\c\nHow about bringing me back some\nShoal Salt and Shoal Shells?\c\nI can make you something good if\nyou bring me those items.
If you bring me four each of the\nShoal Salt and Shoal Shells,\r\nI can make you a Shell Bell...\c\nYou can get more every day.
Oh, hey! Shoal Salt and Shoal Shells!\nAnd enough of them, too!\c\nWould you like me to make you a\nShell Bell with them?
All righty, then! I’ll make you a\nShell Bell right away.\c\n...\c\nThere! Done!

And...\nI’m not quite sure what this is,\r\nbut I got this recently.\c\nIf you like, please take this, too.
Oh... Is that so...?\nI wanted to make a Shell Bell...
You wouldn’t have space in your Bag\neven if I were to make one for you.\c\nYou should make some room and then\ncome back for a Shell Bell.

Ah! [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!
I bet you must be surprised to\nsee me in a place like this!
That promise that we made back then...\nThank you for keeping your end of it.
It was really all thanks to you that\nI could make it this far, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].
It was only because I lost to you back\nthen that I could become even stronger.
I’m sure that you and your Pokémon must\nhave had to overcome a lot, too...\c\nTo make it all the way here.\nRight, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]?
Everyone’s grown so much...
And now we’ll finally get to\nsee just what we all can do.\c\nStanding here facing you\nagain gives me chills...
...But I won’t give up!\c\nI won’t lose anymore.
My Pokémon have given me the\ncourage and strength to fight.\c\nI have to win for their sake!
So get ready... Here I come!
[~ 11]
...\c\n...
Arghhh!!!
...\c\n...\c\n...Hah.
[VAR TRNAME(0000)], you...\nAnd your Pokémon, too...\c\nThank you for not holding back when you\nbattled against us...\r\nFor not holding back when you beat us...
And...\c\nGallade... Everyone...\c\nThank you so much...
I feel like I’ve been able to take\nanother step forward thanks to you!
I couldn’t beat you this time, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].\nBut I’ll stay here and continue training.\c\nAnd one day... Look out!\nI swear I’ll catch up to you one day!\c\nWhen I do, promise we’ll battle again!\nThat’s a promise I intend to live up to!

Oh! I know!\nI’ll give you this to keep.\c\nI hope it will always remind you\nof your battle with me...and with\r\nGallade and the rest of my team.
If you have a male Kirlia as one of your\npartners, [VAR TRNAME(0000)], I hope that you\r\nmight use that Dawn Stone on it for me.

Ugh...
Ahahaha!
How pathetic you appear now.\nThe fool, Archie.
Ugh!\nArghhh...
M-Maxie...you...!
Fuhahaha!\nJust as I predicted.
L-little scamp...
Even I, the great Maxie, have found myself\nwishing for something I cannot justify.\c\nAnd the illogical desire that I harbored was\nto have you present here at this moment.
Hahaha...\nAnd now that fool’s wish has come true.\c\nFantastic!\nNothing could please me more!
I suppose I should make introductions...\c\nI present to you my incomparable partner,\nwho will assist Team Magma in driving\r\nhumanity forward to its next level!
The super-ancient Pokémon...Groudon!
Behold!\c\nThis great form slumbering in defiance\nof even the broiling lava surrounding it!
...
So long have I waited for this day...\c\nImmeasurably long!
This foolish world has held back humanity’s\nprogress out of misguided idealism regarding\r\nthe coexistence of humans and Pokémon.\c\nBut this ancient creature can bring that to\nits rightful end, creating a new land upon\r\nwhich humanity may stride freely forward.
And now, you are the final obstacle\nremaining between me and my goals.\c\nIt behooves me to use every tool at\nmy disposal to eliminate you.
Fuhahaha!
Hah...\nHah... Hahhh...
...\nAh.\r\nAha...\c\nFuhahaha...
Splendid.\c\nJust splendid, my young Trainer.
No, it is more than that!\c\nI should be calling you my young hero!\c\nBelieving until the very end that a\nworld where humanity and Pokémon\r\ncoexist must be the best...\c\nRejecting my ideals without a\nsecond thought...\c\nYes, watching you struggle desperately\nto halt the beginning of the world’s end...\r\nYou are undoubtedly a hero!
So noble...\c\nAnd yet.\c\nI will not yield! I will not bend!\nMy ideals will not be shaken!\c\nMy dream for the world’s next\nstep forward will never change!
Wait! Maxie!
Buh?!\nTabitha?!
Do stop that now... Please!\nMaxie!
You just don’t understand!\c\nWhat Groudon will bring about upon\nawakening is an end to the world!
Y-you dare—?!
Hyuhn?!
Humph.\c\nDid you think I had not noticed?\nThat I had somehow failed to\r\nrealize you were after my spot?\c\nSuch a sad development indeed.\nTo be betrayed by my number two...
In the end, there is only one being upon\nwhich I can depend! Now, Groudon!\c\nAbsorb all of the power resting in\nthis Red Orb, and reclaim yourself!\r\nRevert to your primal form!
Augh... You...
Gahahahaha!\nAt last...\c\nAT LAST!\nI’ve finally done it!!!\c\nA new world for human\nevolution will be born!!!\c\nWe shall stride forward!!!
Ohh... What have you done...\nBoss... What...
...Hm? A message from\nour members outside?
What is it?\c\nSo the sun has turned mercilessly\nfierce in its heat.\c\nI should expect so.\nThat is what I have long—\r\nNo, what WE have long wished for.
What?!\nThe heat is greater than simulations predicted?\r\nIt will be a risk to our own safety if it continues?!\c\nThat cannot be...\c\nIt has only just awoken...\nWhere is it getting so much power from?\c\nAnd how much more will it gain when it does\nundergo Primal Reversion...\c\nC-continue your readings! Then report back!
Boss?! Maxie?!\nJust what’s happening on the surface?!
All that matters is...\c\nThat I have used the Red Orb\nto awaken Groudon.\c\nAnd now...\c\nI will transform this planet to\na land ideal for humanity.
Hey, Maxie.\c\nLooks like we underestimated the\npower of the super-ancient Pokémon...\c\nThe power of Primal Reversion...
What...did you say?
Primal Groudon brings about an “end,” all right.\nBut you don’t get to choose what end.\c\nIt’s gonna drive every living thing on this\nplanet to its death!\c\nThe only thing waiting for us is despair.\nA despair we can’t even run from.\r\nA despair that’s gonna crush humanity.\c\nYou blasted fool...\c\nAnd it’s all happening ’cause you were\ncocky enough to think you could control\r\nthe super-ancient Pokémon’s power!
So the information we received from the\nWeather Institute was true...\c\nBoss Maxie!\c\nWe’ll never get anywhere just standing around\nhere like this!\c\nThere isn’t a moment to spare!\nWe must confirm the situation on the outside!
Child! You’re coming, too! Hurry up!
Now that I have at last obtained\nthe power of [VAR COLOR(0001)]Primal Groudon[VAR COLOR(0000)]!
Indeed! Even Mega Evolution!\c\nDo not delude yourself that you and your\nPokémon are the only ones capable of it.\c\nI must apologize for making you wait through\nour encounters at Mt. Chimney and Mt. Pyre\r\nwithout treating you to this sight.\c\nBrace yourself for my ultimate attack!
I will use the Red Orb to awaken Groudon,\nrevert it to its primal form,\r\nand put an end to all else!
This is the time to take back the great\nEvolution you lost in the ancient past!\r\nReclaim the possibility you once held!
Kahahahaha!\nGAHAHAHAHAHAHA!

Urk...
Bwahahaha!
You’re looking pretty pathetic now,\naren’t you? The great Maxie!
Ugh...
A-Archie...you...
Bwahahaha!
Y-you, child...
Well, if it isn’t my little adversary!\nI can’t even find the words\r\nto praise you as you deserve.
Sometimes it’s best to keep things simple.\nAll I’ll say is you met my expectations, scamp!
And I’m not just talking about today,\nbut everything you’ve done up till now.\c\nAnd that’s why you’ll get the honor of\nmeeting my new partner before anyone\r\nelse living in this world!
The super-ancient Pokémon...KYOGRE!!!
How ’bout that?!\c\nThat beautiful form so long resting\nat peace within the azure sea!
...
I’ve been waiting so long\nfor this day to come.
We humans have disregarded Pokémon\nand nature both in our endless pursuit\r\nof our own desires and needs...\c\nAnd in the process, we’ve created this\nbroken and disordered world...\c\nBut this is the day when I finally obtain\nthe power to return everything to how\r\nit once was—to return to our beginnings!\c\nNow that I can release the ancient power!
And now, you are the last token\nresistance that’s trying to ruin my day.\c\nI’ll use everything my team and I have\nto crush you once and for all!
GRAAAAAAAAAHHHHHH!!!
Hah...\nHah... Ahh...
...\nAh.\r\nAha...\c\nAhahahaha...
Perfect! You’re just as great as any little\nhero trying to save the world oughta be!
But it changes nothing!\c\nI can’t give up now!\nI can’t!
I WILL use the power of this Blue Orb\nto awaken Kyogre at last!\c\nThen I’ll return everything in this world\nto its original, pure state!!
Archie!
Shelly?!
That’s enough!
Can’t you see that the world you dream of\nand the world that Kyogre will create\r\nare two completely different places?!
[~ 26]
[~ 27]
Shelly...\c\nI always believed that you at least\nwould understand my dreams...
But no! In the end, the only one\nI can depend on is you, Kyogre!\c\nAbsorb all the power resting in this\nBlue Orb, and reclaim yourself!\r\nRevert to your primal form!
No... That...
Bwahahahaha!\nAt last...\c\nAT LAST!\nI’ve finally done it!!!\c\nIt hasn’t even finished reversion,\nand it still has this much power!!!\c\nWith this I can return everything\nto its natural beginning!\c\nIt’s time at last!
What...have you done...
Is that the crew outside?
What is it...?\c\nOh?\nSo the great deluge has begun...\c\nBwahahahaha!\nBut of course it has!\r\nThat is exactly what I have—
What...?\c\nWhat do you mean far\nmore than we thought?!\c\nIt can’t be...\nThen if it completes its\r\nPrimal Reversion...\c\nN-never mind that!\nJust keep an eye on it!
Archie!\c\nWhat’s going on outside?!
All that matters is...\c\nThat I have used the Blue Orb\nto awaken Kyogre...\c\nAnd now...\c\nI will return this world to\nits natural state...\c\nThe state that is best\nfor Pokémon!
Archie.\c\nIt appears you have made a grave\nerror regarding Kyogre’s powers.
What...did you say?
The “beginning” that Primal Kyogre brings about...\nThe way that it resets the world...\c\nIt starts by driving every living thing on this\nplanet to death first!\c\nThis path leads only to an inescapable\ndespair that cannot be withstood.\r\nThat is all you have brought us.\c\nThis is what comes of the madness of\nthinking that you could ever control the\r\nsuper-ancient Pokémon’s power!
I knew it.\c\n...\c\nWe just need to get out of here!\nStanding around complaining isn’t\r\ngoing to solve anything!
You, too! Well, hurry up!
The ancient power of [VAR COLOR(0001)]Primal Kyogre[VAR COLOR(0000)]!
Oh? And...Mega Evolution?\c\nDid ya think that you and your Pokémon\nare the only ones who can use it?\c\nLet me show you now what I didn’t get\nthe chance to show you at Mt. Chimney...\c\nThis is the true power of my team!
Now! AWAKEN, KYOGRE!\c\nRETURN EVERYTHING TO THE WAY IT WAS!!
This is the time to take back the great\nEvolution you lost in the ancient past!
Bwahahahahahaha!\nBwaha! AHAHAHAHAHA!

It’s a model of a ship!\c\nIt seems quite old, but it\nmust be well cared for...\r\nIt’s absolutely spotless.
It’s a showcase!\c\nThere is a lock on it,\nso you can’t open it.
It’s the Team Aqua flag!
...
Bro...\c\nSorry.
...
Archie...\c\nIt looks like Matt feels sorry for what he’s done.
...\c\nIt’s unforgivable.
Aah... Bro...
Absolutely unforgivable!
Umm, Archie...
I can’t forgive...\c\nWhat I’ve done!
Huh?!
I drove my own loyal crew to such despair as this...\c\nI have no right to call myself a leader anymore.
I’m...\nI’m sorry, Matt. I truly am.
Ooh...ahh...\nBro...
I’m planning to start everything over from scratch, Matt.\c\nWhat happened back then with Kyogre...\nAnd what happened this time...\c\nLook, you can’t do anything if you’re all wrapped up in\nwhat you believe.\c\nTeam Aqua or Team Magma...\nPokémon or people...\r\nThere’s no reason why we’ve gotta pick just one of ’em.\c\nIt might be a pain, it might even be a bit scary, but we’ve\ngotta take that step into the unknown.\r\nMix with people who aren’t like us...\c\nThat’s the kind of Team Aqua that I want us to be from\nnow on.\c\n...\c\nYou think you can be a part of that kind of\nTeam Aqua?\r\nMatt...
Oh, oh!\nYou... You bet I will!
I can’t believe these two.\c\nWhat do they think they’re doing standing there\nwith their faces all wet with tears.
Well...\nI guess it could be worse.
Guwahhh?!
All right!\nAnd the winner is Zinnia!
Archie...\nAre you...OK?
Ugh...
I’ll be keelhauled!\c\nHow did I get beat by\nthis little slip of a girl?
Murrr!♪ Murrr!♪
Oh, oh, what’s this?!\nAren’t you a happy girl, Aster! ♪
Just what I’d expect of my daughter!\nWe’re so in sync! Ahahaha!
You...\nWho are you?
Who am I?\c\nThat’s a surprisingly\ndifficult question.
...\c\nI couldn’t become who I was supposed\nto be, so who does that make me now?\c\n...
Haha! Whatever, right?\c\nEnough with the introspection\nand the soul searching...
You there! [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\nDon’t just stand there like a stick in the mud.\r\nCome on over and say hi.
You!
Scamp?\nBut why are you...
Isn’t it obvious? He’s the hero, right?\nHere to save the world again.
Isn’t it obvious? She’s the heroine, right?\nHere to save the world again.
Oops. But looks like [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0100)]she’s a bit too late this time.\nIf only you’d been here just one minute earlier!
Zinnia grabbed the Key Stone\naway from Archie!
Wha—?!
Archie! Hang in there!
There now.\nI’d say this Key Stone is mine.
We finally got everything, Aster.
Murrr?
Now we can do it... The summoning.
We will summon Rayquaza!
Well then, looks like my job here is done.\nSo don’t mind me while I excuse myself.
Oh. [VAR TRNAME(0000)]?
I really hope you’ll come chasing\nafter me, you know?\c\nWe’ll be heading to that ancient\ntower, sealed since primal times,\r\nthe [VAR COLOR(0002)]Sky Pillar[VAR COLOR(0000)].
If you don’t know what that is, well,\nask that former Champ of yours.\r\nHe’ll know what I’m talking about.
Find me there!
Murrr!
...Oh man!\c\nWhat makes her think she\ncan just do whatever she wants\r\nand then hightail it out of here?!
...\nLittle scamp...
Heh... Fine...
I guess it’s just fate.\nThat you showed up now of all times.
...
Shelly...\nGive it to the kid.
Shelly...\nGive it to the girl.
...What?!\nI-is that OK?!
Yeah...\c\nWhat could I do with a Mega Stone\nanyway, now that I’ve lost my Key Stone?
...I understand.
The Sharpedonite...\c\nMake sure your Sharpedo\nholds on to it tightly.
You take my power, scamp...\nI’m giving it to you.
That woman...\c\nI don’t think she’s just any old Trainer.\nNot with the way she controlled those\r\nDragon-type Pokémon of hers...
I got no idea what she’s planning...\c\nBut I think you’re our best bet\nat stopping her now, little scamp.\c\nDo that for me.
The Entry Call (Ver. 0.09) app\nrang on your PokéNav Plus!
Steven: ...[VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\nAre you all right?!
Steven: ...[VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\nAre you all right?!
Steven: ...\c\nSteven: Is that right... I never even imagined...\c\nSteven: The Key Stone...\nThe Sky Pillar... And the Draconid people...\c\nSteven: So that’s it...\nI begin to see the line connecting these dots.\c\nSteven: I think we need to meet up at once to\ndiscuss what we should do next.\c\nSteven: I’ll be waiting at the Space Center.\nUp on 2F.\c\nSteven: Do hurry.
...Kzt!
That crazy lady...\nShe said that the former Champion\r\nwould know what she was about...\c\nYou’d know where to find him, right?
Go get her for Archie!
Little scamp...\c\nNaw... It’s [VAR TRNAME(0000)], isn’t it?
Little scamp...\c\nNaw... It’s [VAR TRNAME(0000)], isn’t it?
Make yourself at home, all right?\c\nYou can kick back and relax here.
Make yourself at home, all right?\c\nYou can kick back and relax here.
Oh my goodness me!\nThanks for coming!\c\nThanks to you, it looks like\nwe of Team Aqua will be able to\r\ntake a step in a new direction.\c\nThank you kindly for everything!
Oh!\nIsn’t that that kid I love?!\c\nThanks to you, it looks like my bro\nand everybody else in Team Aqua\r\nwill be able to power up even more!\c\nThe gratitude we feel is overwhelming!\nThanks!

It’s an old radio and cassette recorder!\c\nA cassette tape labeled “Bro Special, Vol. 7”\nis in the deck.
It’s a well-worn training bag.\c\n“5,000 punches a day” is written in big\nletters across the center of the bag.
It’s a Wailmer Doll!\c\nIt has a sour-sweet scent.
There is a picture of a boy with a shaved head,\na girl with black hair, and a Pokémon with three notes\r\nattached to its head.\c\n“The 7th day of the —th month, —002.\nWith Arc—e and —rachi.”\c\nThe letters at the edge of the picture\nare faded and hard to read...

Oh! I knew you’d come!
You’re the first punk ever to sneak\ninto this hideout and make it this far!\c\nI expected nothing less from a crumb\nlike you!
But I’ve got some bad news for you!\c\nWe already completely\nfinished upgrading the ship!
Look at that drill!\c\nAs long as we’ve got that thing, we could KO the\nseal over the Seafloor Cavern with one punch!
My bro Archie’s in the ship!\c\nCome at me! If you take me out fast,\nyou might be able to catch up to him!
Before you do, though...\c\nWe need to settle once and for all who’s stronger,\nyou and your sorry Pokémon, or me and my\r\nnot-so-sorry Pokémon!
...Hoo!\c\n...Haaahh!
I’m...\c\nHeating up!
Hooah! Full on!\nI’m burning up!
Me! You! Pokémon!\nMixing it up! Dueling!
Well! Welll! Wellllll!\c\nLet’s battle it out until\nwe’ve got nothing left!
Hah...\nHah... Hah...
Bro!\c\nIt’s all...on you...now...
...
While we were\nbattling it out...
My bro Archie finished\ngetting ready...
...
I have only one hope...
For my bro Archie to finish doing\nwhat he set out to do...\c\nThat’s all...
My bro Archie is\neverything to me...\c\nI live to serve my bro...
...All right, then.\c\nYou took me out, so I’ll give you an idea of what\nthe world will be like if my bro has his way.
My bro Archie is headed for the big blue sea\nthat stretches out from Lilycove City.\r\nDeep beneath the surface is the Seafloor Cavern.\c\nThat’s where the world my bro hopes to create...\c\nWhere the beginnings of the primordial world will be felt...
Regular people and Pokémon can’t make it there, though.\c\nHow could you get there...
Why don’t you look around in towns by the sea\nand use your own thick head to think about it?
They’re blueprints that read,\n“Proposed Alterations to Submarine Explorer 1.”
Instructions on how to use the panel\nthat controls the locks are written here.
Teeheehee!
We finally meet again.
Hm? Ah...\c\nIs this the first time we’ve met?
Nincompoop!\nIt doesn’t matter!
Brace yourself!\nWe’ll show you the power of quintuplets!
Hah, hah, hah...
We lost...
It’s odd.\c\nI can’t believe five of us couldn’t defeat\njust one Trainer. Did you cheat?\r\nGrumble, grumble...
Nincompoop!\c\nStop whining!
Our leaders are ahead!\nYou have no chance to defeat them!
Our leader’s room isn’t here.\c\nYou’re the second person to\nmake this mistake. There was\r\nalso a girl with a Whismur.
The girl who came here asking\nwhere our leader’s room was...\r\nI heard she was an intruder.\c\nI probably shouldn’t have told her\nwhere it was.\c\nArchie will give me noogies...\n

It’s a machine for irradiating a Meteorite with lasers.\c\nIt seems experiments were being conducted until just\nthis moment. The surroundings of the machine smell\r\nlike something burned.
PROJECT AZOTH\nFile No. 2\c\nWe intend to analyze the power of the ultimate weapon\nused in Kalos 3,000 years ago and work on the\r\ndevelopment of a drill weapon utilizing the technology.\c\nThe Seafloor Cavern is sealed by the power of a\nLegendary Pokémon.\c\nThe only way to gain access to the cavern is to break\nthe seal with power that exceeds that of the Pokémon.\c\nAccording to the report from the Petalburg recon team,\nDevon Corporation holds the secret of the technology\r\nof the ultimate weapon.\c\nWe will dedicate all our resources to obtaining\nthis technology.
It’s a machine for testing the durability of the suit.\nTouch panels are crammed on the screen. The labels say,\r\n“Give it a walloping”\r\n“Throw a lot of weight on it”\r\n“Wring it tightly”\r\n“Drop it from really high up”\r\n“Burn it severely”\r\n“Submerge it intensely”\r\n“Thrash it hard”\r\n“Knead it massively”
“Danger! Please don’t play inside.”\c\n“Caution! It’s super dangerous!\nReally! I mean it!”\c\n“If something bad happens because you didn’t believe\nme, don’t blame me!”\c\n...That’s what’s written on a note tacked to the wall.
Sturdy protective gear is attached to the machine.
Beep, beep, beep.\c\nI AM AN A.I. MY PURPOSE IS TO SUPPORT\nTHE DEVELOPMENT OF THE AQUA SUIT.\c\nTHE DEVELOPMENT OF THE AQUA SUIT IS\n120 PERCENT COMPLETE. CONGRATULATIONS.\c\nTHE AQUA SUIT CAN WITHSTAND\nWATER PRESSURE AT ANY DEPTH.\c\nTHE AQUA SUIT CAN WITHSTAND THE\nG-FORCES OF THE SECOND COSMIC VELOCITY.\c\nIT IS AN ULTRA SUPER SUIT.\nTHANK YOU VERY MUCH.\c\nHOWEVER, THE INSIDE OF THE SUIT MAY BE\nPERCEIVED AS SLIGHTLY HUMID AND WET.\r\n...sorry about that...\c\nTHIS CONCLUDES MY STATUS REPORT.\nGOOD-BYE.\c\nBeep, beep, beep.
It’s a machine that controls lasers to irradiate Meteorites.\nTouch panels are crammed on the screen. The labels say,\r\n“Fire the laser beam delicately.”\r\n“Fire the laser beam a little bit more.”\r\n“Fire the laser beam fairly judiciously.”\r\n“Fire the laser beam like whoa.”
Meteorites... Natural energy... Super-ancient Pokémon...\c\nHere, we’re conducting experiments to understand\nhow they all relate and create a Blue Orb artificially.\r\nBut...we haven’t had much success.\c\nIt may be too difficult for humans to solve.
The Aqua Suit is the fruit of the collaboration\nof Devon’s and our science and technology.\c\nIf not for Shelly, who used to work for Devon,\nthe invention would never have materialized.
I’m not slacking off!\c\nI’m facing a very difficult decision. What drink\nto take with me on my 12-hour lookout shift—\r\nFresh Water, Soda Pop, Lemonade...

PROJECT AZOTH\nFile No. 1\c\nThe goal of Project AZOTH is to return the world—\nreturn everything—to the beginning.\c\nIn order to further the project, we must proceed\nwith research on Kyogre’s Primal Reversion.\c\nPrimal Reversion is a potential of Pokémon\nEvolution, a potential different from Mega Evolution.\c\nMega Evolution is made possible by the energy\nof people and Pokémon.\c\nPrimal Reversion is made possible by natural energy.\c\nIn Primal Reversion, Kyogre absorbs natural energy\ninto its body, thereby increasing its power dramatically.\c\nBoth states significantly enhance Pokémon’s power:\nthe difference lies in the source of the required energy.
Expanding the sea...\nWhat exactly do we have to do to achieve that?
I guess we have to keep\nsquirting water, right?\r\nPfloosh! Pfloosh!
Each person’s bed reveals a little something\nof their character...\r\nAnd reveals a unique odor signature, as well!
Taking a break is important, isn’t it?\c\nTeam Aqua doesn’t have fixed working hours\nnor specific break times, so if we wanted,\r\nwe could take a break all day long.
Hey, you—no, no, no.\c\nThis is Team Aqua’s library, where documents\non our highly confidential plan are stored.\c\nNo outsiders are allowed to enter.
[~ 15]
There’s a bed.\nLet’s take a rest.

What? What? What do you want with\nTeam Aqua?\c\nOur boss isn’t here! He’s gone off to\nsteal something important!\c\n...\n“Where did he go?”\c\nWahaha! Do you really think I’d tell\nyou something that crucial?
What? What? What do you want with\nTeam Aqua?\c\nOur boss isn’t here!\nHe’s gone off to steal a submarine!\c\n...\n“Where did he go?”\c\nWahaha! Do you really think I’d tell\nyou something that crucial?
We, Team Aqua, decided to make\na fresh start with Archie!
That Trainer with black bobbed hair...\nShe was incredibly strong.\c\nBut our leader is beyond the\nrooms full of warp panels.\r\nIt’s not that easy to get there...
Finally, Team Aqua was able\nto make a fresh start!
Mumble, mumble...\c\nStaying on my feet all day\nmakes my feet swell. I hate it...
Mumble, mumble...\c\nI stopped whining about standing all day,\nand it doesn’t bother me anymore.
We’re insanely busy preparing\nfor the new Team Aqua.
A woman with a Whismur is...inside...
What shall I do from now on?\c\nI have plenty of time, so I’ll\ntake my time figuring it out.
What? What? What do you want with\nTeam Aqua?\c\nOur boss isn’t here! He’s on his way to\nMt. Pyre on Route 122!\c\n...\n“Why did he go?”\c\nWahaha! Do you really think I’d tell\nyou something that crucial?
What? What? What do you want with\nTeam Aqua?\c\nOur boss isn’t here!\nHe’s on his way to Slateport City!\c\n...\n“Why did he go?”\c\nWahaha! Do you really think I’d tell\nyou something that crucial?
What? What? What do you want with\nTeam Aqua?\c\nWell, we don’t mind you coming here\nfor no reason, though.
What...what...what is that\nDragon-type-Pokémon user...\c\nHer strength...\nIt’s astonishing.\c\nWould you say she’s stronger\nthan Archie?
Honestly, making a fresh start\nis a bother. It’s too hard.\c\nBut if all of us work together,\nwe might be able to make it.\c\nTeam Aqua is the team that\nmakes me feel that way.

Black bob hair...\nActually, she’s my type.
One bad thing happens after another—\nbut we have to get through this.
Archie seems to be fine for now.\nWhat a relief...

Yo.
I thought something was a bit noisy,\nand who is it but the usual scamp!
Sorry, scampo, but I’m afraid I just don’t\nhave time to play with you right now.
The Blue Orb that’s long been\nenshrined here at Mt. Pyre...\r\nIt belongs to Team Aqua now!
...Ma-a-att!
Oh! Boss!
How about you do a favor for our lively\nlittle visitor, and keep h[VAR GENDBR(00FF,0202)]imer entertained?
You’d better use your full strength, too,\nso you don’t offend our honored guest!
Bwahahahaha!\c\nWith this Blue Orb in my hands, I won’t\neven need the power of the Meteorite\r\nto awaken the beast from the deep!\c\nAll I need now is a way to get to the\nplace where it sleeps...\c\nAll I have to do is get that [VAR COLOR(0002)]submarine[VAR COLOR(0000)]\nthey’re making in Slateport!\c\nCome on, boys!\nWe’re for [VAR COLOR(0002)]Slateport City[VAR COLOR(0000)]!
All right then, until the Boss makes\nhis getaway, I’ll be your opponent!
Oohh... Ha! Ha! Hah!
That was fun!\c\nI knew you’d show me a good time!
I look forward to facing you again someday!
Aye, me, what disaster...\c\nThe Blue Orb...stolen from\nour safekeeping...
The Blue Orb and Red Orb\nmust never be separated.\r\nThey belong together...
Mmm...
I will entrust the remaining\nRed Orb to you, young one.
And I beg you... Chase after those\nthieves and take back their orb!\c\nThat wretched leader of theirs...\c\nI’m sure he said they were [VAR COLOR(0002)]headed[VAR COLOR(0000)]\n[VAR COLOR(0002)]for Slateport City[VAR COLOR(0000)] next...
The Red Orb I gave you, and\nthe Blue Orb that they stole...\c\nHaving the two separated can\nonly lead to disaster...\c\nI’m sure their leader said they\nwould [VAR COLOR(0002)]head to Slateport[VAR COLOR(0000)] next...
So it has happened...\nKyogre has been awoken...\c\nAnd the mysterious orb that\ntransformed it into its true\r\nform—its Primal Reversion—\r\nit was the Blue Orb that\r\nwas stolen away from us...\c\nMy people first unearthed it\nin Sootopolis’s Cave of Origin.\c\nPerhaps Kyogre has some tie\nto the Cave of Origin...
So it has happened...\nGroudon has been awoken...\c\nAnd the mysterious orb that\ntransformed it into its true\r\nform—its Primal Reversion—\r\nit was the Red Orb that\r\nwas stolen away from us...\c\nMy people first unearthed it\nin Sootopolis’s Cave of Origin.\c\nPerhaps Groudon has some\ntie to the Cave of Origin...

Mt. Pyre exists to soothe the spirits of Pokémon that\nhave passed on...\c\nFrom so high up, we can look down upon Hoenn.\nSuch a view must bring peace even to those\r\nlost Pokémon...\c\nIs it coincidence that you are here?\c\nWill you hear my tale? A tale long told in the\nHoenn region?
It happened long, long ago...\c\nThe world was wracked by an unceasing battle between\nKyogre, the Pokémon of the sea, and Groudon,\r\nthe Pokémon of the land...\c\nKyogre raising huge waves and carving out oceans...\c\nGroudon raising mountains and creating continents...\c\nTheir fierce duel raged without end.\c\nThe world was assaulted by vicious rains and merciless\nheat in turn.\c\nOnly one power was great enough to quell this\nterrible outpouring.\r\nThat of the Blue Orb and the Red Orb.\c\nThe light which poured from the Red Orb calmed\nKyogre in its fury.\c\nThe light which swelled from the Blue Orb quieted\nGroudon in its rage.\c\nThe two, now docile, dove deep into the sea\nand disappeared from human eyes...

I see...\nWell, that, too, is fine...
[~ 55]
Hmph...
So it was you...
I’m sorry I had to postpone my\ndefeat of you at Mt. Chimney.\c\nAnd now, I am sorry that I have\nto postpone it once more.\c\nI cannot afford to waste even\na single second now.
For the Red Orb which has long been\nenshrined here at Mt. Pyre...\r\nNow belongs to me, the great Maxie!
Courtney.
...Ha.
You must see to it that our dear visitor is not\nneglected due to my inability to battle now...
Do be so kind as to battle h[VAR GENDBR(00FF,0202)]imer with\nthe full measure of your strength...\r\nand crush this [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0403)]boygirl so that [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0100)]she will\r\nnever again for a single moment\r\ndream of defying our team!
Fufufu...\c\nWith this Red Orb in my possession, I have\nno need for the power of the Meteorite\r\nto awaken the beast from the deep!\c\nAll that I need now is a way to reach the\nplace where it sleeps...\c\nThe only task remaining is obtaining the\n[VAR COLOR(0002)]submarine [VAR COLOR(0000)]being constructed in Slateport!\c\nWe move out at once, team!\nOur next destination...[VAR COLOR(0002)]Slateport City[VAR COLOR(0000)]!
...\c\n...Analyzing.
...Hah. ♪
...Again?\nThat’s unanticipated.\c\n...I knew it.\c\nYou...are interesting!\n...Haha. ♪
I’m looking forward to...\c\nI’m looking forward to...\c\nWhen we...can meet again.
Aye, me, what disaster...\c\nThe Red Orb...\nStolen from our safekeeping...
The Red Orb and Blue Orb\nmust never be separated.\r\nThey belong together...

Oh?
You...\nWhat are you doing in a place like this?
Hmmm, I see.\c\nI usually train here.\nToday I had planned to come\r\nsee my grandma here, though.\c\nWell, good luck with your training!\nSee you in the Pokémon League!
Oh, I see.\c\nThat must be why my grandma\nwas talking about you earlier.\c\nIt looks like you made a lasting\nimpression on my grandma.\c\nWell, I guess I’ll be on my way.\nSee you in the Pokémon League!

It’s not good enough yet.\c\nFor a final resting place that my Pokémon Meow and\nI will be in, this is not good enough.
Why is he so particular about it?\c\nOnce you die, everything will be gone...
A text inscribed on a tombstone\nhonoring a deceased person or a\r\nPokémon is called an epitaph.\c\nI’ve been contemplating what to\nwrite in my epitaph.\c\nI have so many great achievements\nthat I’m at a complete loss.
The words “Final Resting Place for Pokémon Meow\nand Me” are inscribed on it.

So many things that I had forgotten, they strangely\ncome back to me when I visit here.\c\nIt’s very fascinating.

I make a habit of coming here after\nwork at least once a day.\c\nI’m afraid of forgetting my Pokémon.
I wonder why cemeteries\nare built...
I’m so old that all my tears\nhave dried up completely.\c\nBut my memories flood my\nmind all the time.
Because I loved my Pokémon very much,\nI spent a lot of money to get a good spot.\c\nYou know, you can measure the depth of\nlove by the money you spend.

All sorts of things wander the slopes\nof Mt. Pyre...\c\nThere is no telling what may happen.\nTake this. It’s for your own good.
Have the lead Pokémon\nhold that Cleanse Tag.\c\nIt will help ward off wild\nPokémon.
Did you come to pay your respects\nto the spirits of departed Pokémon?\c\nYou must care a lot about your Pokémon.
This is the final resting place of my Zigzagoon.\nOh, how I cherished it...

Every time I think of the Pokémon I lost,\nI wish it had lived forever.\c\nBut I also think it would be tragic to\nbecome immortal without wishing for it.
It’s natural for people and Pokémon\nto be buried in graves once they die.\c\nBut I heard that’s not the usual way\nin some places in the world.

This mysterious machine...\nIt gives no response whatsoever.
The power contained in the Meteorite...
If we merge the explosive energy contained within the\nplanet’s core with the Meteorite’s power...
I remember those eyes.\nAnd the indomitable will that seems to burn behind them.\c\nAhhh. Now I recall.\nYou are the one who defied us at Slateport’s\r\nOceanic Museum.\c\nAnd, your presence here tells me that you have\ndefeated Tabitha.\c\nYes, I see now that the stirring of interest I felt was\nnot misplaced.\c\nHmph. You show true promise.\c\nFine.\nI will attempt to educate you.
Thousands of years ago, there lived a most\npowerful being that was said to be capable\r\nof creating new lands on the planet.\c\nThe power which we in Team Magma seek—\c\nThis power, which can expand the available\nlandmass, belongs to a legendary and super-\r\nancient Pokémon.\c\nThough now it slumbers, having lost the source\nof its power and been trapped in a deep sleep.
So what is it that we must do to awaken this\nslumbering giant?\c\nOur research has led us here,\nto Mt. Chimney.\r\nYes, here...to this very Meteorite.\c\nIf we create the right conditions, we should find\nourselves able to alter this Meteorite’s qualities.\c\nYes, even into a Mega Stone.\c\nEven into a Key Stone.\c\nAnd here, at Mt. Chimney—\c\nHmph... I should not say too much.\nThat is the end of today’s lesson.
Now then.\nI believe it is time we begin.\r\nThe time for the purge has come.\c\nI do believe that I made myself quite clear when we\nwere last in Slateport.\c\nI warned you that any fool standing in our way would\nbe met without mercy!
I will bury you by my own hand.\c\nI hope you appreciate this honor!
[~ 17]
Oh?\nSo you repulsed the great Maxie in battle.\r\nHaha... You never fail to entertain me!
An excellent start!\c\nThis time, permit me to\nunleash my full strength!\c\nOnce you’ve tasted my\nPokémon’s Mega Evolved\r\npower, you will say good-bye\r\nto your last shred of hope!
Hm?
Yes, it’s me.\c\n...\nOh?\c\nThen it is Mt. Pyre.
I understand.\nI will come at once.
I am sorry to cut our battle short,\nbut I’m afraid I must excuse myself.\c\nSuch rudeness demands reparation.\nTake this Meteorite with my apologies.\r\nYou may do with it what you like.
And I will not again forget the face of the\nTrainer who managed to thwart me in battle!
Huh?\nIf it ain’t that little scamp!\c\nBut blast that Maxie!\nHe just escaped us!
And he just left behind the Meteorite\nthat he’s been crazy about finding?
Hyahyahya?!\c\nIt’s you! You’re the one who tried to\ninterrupt me, Tabitha, at Meteor Falls!
D-d-do you intend to get in my way once more?\c\nUnngh!\nYou’re really...
really, really, really, really, really, really...
really, really, really, really, really,\nreally, really, really, really, really...
reeeallllyyyyy...\c\n...an obnoxious child, aren’t you?!
Ahh... Ahh...
I will...crush you.\c\nSo that you...never get in my way...again.
[~ 34]
I knew you would be strong.
What a shame, though! The Meteorite we got from\nProfessor Whoever is already in our Boss’s hands!\c\nWhere’s the Boss, you ask?\nAh, yes, yes, right this way!\c\nOh, I do hope that you can be shown\nTeam Magma’s true power!
Ahya! Ahyahyahyahya!
The Boss is right this way!\c\nOh, I do hope that you can be shown\nTeam Magma’s true power!

Yeah!\nDouse them in fire!
Go! Stomp Team Aqua!\nAnd expand the land!
Pwump!
Pwump!
Pwump!
Pwump!
Pwump!
Pwump!
Get out of my blasted way,\nye scurvy Team Magma knaves!\c\nOr face a keelhauling!
Confound the lot of you!\nLet me through, you bilge rats!
Oh no... Team Magma outnumbers us!\nWe can’t keep up with them!
If they expand the land, there’ll be\nfewer habitats for Water Pokémon!
Team Magma wants to expand the\nlandmass. How’s that for insane?
Pfloosh!
Pfloosh!
Pfloosh!
Pfloosh!
Pfloosh!
Pfloosh!
The great swell of power that sleeps deep\nin the magma...
And it’s the key to controlling the super-ancient\nPokémon’s power?
Ah!\nYou... Uh... No...\c\nOh! Now I know how I know you!\c\nYou’re the little scamp that got in our way in\nSlateport’s museum!\c\nIf you made it here to me, you musta swept right past\nShelly, huh?\c\nHeh...heheheh...\nKrmph! Bwahahahahaha!\c\nI figured you were a big deal the first time I laid eyes\non you, but...whoa!
Heheh.\c\nWell, since you are the real deal, I s’pose\nI could let you in on just what’s going on.\c\nSee, this Meteorite that I just got from good\nold Professor High-an’-Mighty back there...\c\nWith the right bit of work, it seems we could\nturn it into a real nice, valuable bit.\c\nLike maybe a Mega Stone.\c\nOr maybe...even a Key Stone.\c\nAnd as long as we’re here at Mt. Chimney...
Hyup!\c\nBwahahahahah!\nLook what I nearly went an’ did!\c\nIf I give away all my secrets, all the thrill’d be gone\nfrom our relationship!\r\nI think I’ll just leave you hanging here.
Well...\nIt’s not the details that matter any old how.\c\nWe’ve got a thing we gotta do, ya see.\nFrom our point of view, scamp, you’re a dirty villain\r\nwho’s gotten in our way one time too many.\c\nI’m still leader of Team Aqua, so I’m afraid\nit’s the rope’s end for you and your Pokémon.
Now come!
[~ 72]
Heheheh.\c\nYa little scamp!\nI knew you were the real deal!
Brilliant!\c\nThen my team won’t hold back this time!\nMega Evolution, how I’ve missed you!\r\nIt’s been ages since we got to let loose!
Tch.\c\nScamp, I’m gonna have to\nask you to hold that thought.\r\nI’ve gotta use my time-out.
Huh? That you, Matt?\nYou have the worst timing—\c\nWhat?\c\nHoh!\c\nSo Mt. Pyre’s the real—\c\nGot it.\c\nGuess that orb’s not just\nsome fairy tale after all!
All right!\nI’m on my way!
Sorry, scamp.\c\nWhen you’re a grown-up, y’see,\nsometimes things crop up.\c\nGotta put our battle on hold\ntill next time.\c\nTake this. Should help keep ya\nbusy till we settle the score.\r\nHave fun with it, hey?
Let’s meet again somewhere.\c\nI’ll be sure to remember that face.
I’ve seen you before, child.\c\nIt seems you are not to be trifled\nwith, if you repelled Archie in battle.
What is that fool up to now?\c\nHe abandoned the Meteorite\nthat he sought so persistently?
What are you doing here?!
Did you follow us all the\nway here from Meteor Falls?!\c\nHa! Well hey, good job, kid.
OK.\nI admit it.
You are quite the Trainer.\nAnd...
To Archie...\nme...\c\nand all of Team Aqua, your\nexistence is annoying!
The world Archie dreams of would be a\nutopia for Pokémon.\c\nI can’t let you get in the way of someone\nwho’s pushing on toward a perfect world!
Prepare yourself!\c\nThis will finally be the time that I leave\nthat cute face of yours swollen and crying!
[~ 89]
Uh.\c\nAre you telling me you’ve upped\nyour game even more since last time?
You’re a brat with a bright future...
My Pokémon and I don’t have any\nstrength left to fight...\c\nGo on...\nGo and be destroyed by Archie.
Go on...\nGo and be destroyed by Archie.

Ugh!\nImpudent fools!\c\nYou Team Aqua curs dare\nto impede the great Maxie?!

You there! You’re covered in ash.\nDon’t you look worn out for being so young?
If you keep going on down this mountain route,\nthere’s a place called Lavaridge Town.\r\nYou should rest before you go.
The energy contained within Mt. Chimney!\nAnd the power of the Meteorite!\c\nWe in Team Aqua are gonna get it all for\nourselves! Wa ha ha ha!

Can’t be—!\c\nCould he have found out where\nthe real orbs are hidden?!
That sneaky little scientific so-and-so!\nI’m always left watching his bony\r\nbackside run two steps ahead of me!
No!\c\nCould it be possible that he has confirmed\nthe existence of the orbs at last?
Ngh!\nAgain, I find myself outmaneuvered.\r\nWhat a terrible miscalculation!
I suppose there’s no helping it.\c\nOnce a Pokémon Center girl, always a\nPokémon Center girl!\c\nI’ll have your Pokémon in tip-top shape in a jiffy!
Your team’s health was restored!

Hmmm...\nNot a one to be found...
Hello, have you seen any Pokémon\ncalled Shroomish around here?\c\nI really love that Pokémon.
I was going to ambush you, but you\nhad to dawdle in Petalburg Woods\r\nforever, didn’t you?\c\nI got sick of waiting, so here I am!
You! Devon researcher!\c\nHand over those papers!
Aiyeeeh!\c\nYou’re a Pokémon Trainer, aren’t you?\nYou’ve got to help me, please!
Hunh? What do you think you’re doing?\nWhat, you’re going to protect him?\c\nNo one who crosses Team Aqua\ngets any mercy, not even a kid!\c\nCome on and battle me!

And with this, I’ll restore your Pokémon’s health.\nIt’s another technical advance that I’m proud of!
You had your Pokémon’s HP restored!\n

Yo, there!\nYour Pokémon doing OK?\c\nIf your Pokémon are weak and you want\nto avoid battles, you should stay out\r\nof tall grass.
Sometimes, there are things on the\nground even if you can’t see them.\c\nThat’s why I always check where\nI’m walking.
Oh, the thing you have!\nIt’s a PokéNav Plus!\c\nThat means you’re a Trainer.\nThen you should try this item.
It’s a Miracle Seed.\nIf a Pokémon holds that item, its\r\nGrass-type moves become stronger.\c\nBesides Miracle Seed, I think there are\nother convenient items for Pokémon\r\nto hold.
Trainer Tips\c\nAny Pokémon that appears even once\nin a battle is awarded Exp. Points.\c\nTo raise a weak Pokémon, put it at the\ntop of the team list.\c\nAs soon as a battle starts, switch it\nout. It will earn Exp. Points without\r\nbeing exposed to any harm.
Trainer Tips\c\nIn addition to Hit Points (HP), Pokémon\nhave Power Points (PP) that are used to\r\nmake moves during battle.\c\nIf a Pokémon runs out of PP, it must be\ntaken to a Pokémon Center.
...This is the Petalburg\nrecon team checking in.
I’m afraid I have to begin with\nan apology, Ms. Courtney...\r\nIt’s not good news...

The mission is a no-go...\c\nA little something cropped\nup and got in the way...

I’ll continue investigating\nthat energy we detected.
...\c\n...Phew!
But that kid sure had some\npromise as a Trainer, I’d say.

...Mm-hmm.
So in the ancient world, their primal forms once held\nthis much power...?\c\nThe super-ancient Pokémon...\nWhat terrible strength...
But this appearance here...\nIt seems somehow different from Mega Evolution...\c\nHmm.\nIt seems my questions will not be answered today.
Hm?
You are...?
...
Ah, I see.\nIt’s a pleasure, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].
Ah, I see.\nIt’s a pleasure, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].
My apologies.\nMy name is Steven.
I’m interested in rare stones,\nso I travel here and there.\c\nToday my journey brought me\nhere, but what about you?
Oh?\nA letter for me?
[VAR TRNAME(0000)] gave Steven the letter [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0100)]she had been\nentrusted with!
Why, thank you...
It must have been some trouble to track me down.\nI suppose I must repay you in some way.
Let me see...\c\nI will give you this TM. Please accept it.\nIt contains my favorite move, Steel Wing.
If you don’t mind me asking...\c\nDo you feel anything in particular when you look up\nat this wall?
A primal world, lost thousands of years in the past...\c\nA Legendary Pokémon of tremendous power became\nhumanity’s greatest threat...\c\nThe terror aroused by that power is clear to see in this\nancient artwork.
...Yes.\c\nBut not all power is terrible.\c\nYour Pokémon are clearly quite capable as well.
Looking at you all together...\c\nI think that you have in you what it takes\nto become a Pokémon League Champion.\r\nAs long as you keep training, that is.
Good luck to you.\nI must be going now.
Hm, hm, hm. Well, seems like it’s true.\nIt really is just like the wall painting there.\c\nThis one shows Primal Reversion...\nWhile that one shows Mega Evolution...\r\nI guess that proves it once and for all.
Our great ancestors\nonce lived here, too.
The ancestors who passed down through me\nthe knowledge of how to protect the world...\c\nHow to avert the threat that will appear from\nspace, as long was foretold...\r\nFrom a place higher even than the heavens...
...Mum?
What is it, Aster?
Oh?
We do seem to meet an awful lot, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].
Are you also interested\nin this old painting?
Or are you here for the other?\c\nFor one of the Meteorite Shards that\ncan serve as a source of power\r\nfor the Legendary Pokémon that\r\nlives in the heavens above.
Either way...\nYou know I adore you.
That’s it! I can’t help it!\nI have to battle you!
I’ll play nice, though, and ask first...\nYou’re ready to battle me, right?
Fine, fine.\nI ge-e-et it. I’ll wait.\c\nI want to see you\nat your best, y’know.\r\nSo go get ready!
That’s my [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0403)]boygirl!
Now let’s do it!\nGive me a good taste of everything\r\nyou and your Pokémon have to offer!
Niiice! Real nice, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\nOhhh, I really felt that one! Full points to you!
That settles it!\nYou get this Meteorite Shard as a reward!
[~ 41]
...\c\nHey...\nThe actions that you’re taking now...\r\nAre they based on the ideals you cling to?\r\nOr are they based on actual truths?\r\nAnd if they are...\r\nHow much of the truth do you think you know?
...Mum?
Yes, ma’am! Moving out!\nSuch a spoiled girl you are, Aster...
So what’ll be our next stop, hmm, sweetie?
The Entry Call (Ver. 0.09) app\nrang on your PokéNav Plus!
Steven: ...[VAR TRNAME(0000)].
Steven: ...[VAR TRNAME(0000)].
Steven: Were you able to find the Meteorite Shard\nthat we need?\c\nSteven: If you were able to secure it, could you\nhurry back to us at the Mossdeep Space Center?\c\nSteven: I’m afraid we don’t seem to have much\ntime left...\c\nSteven: ...I’ll be waiting for you.
...Kzt!
It is a cave painting depicting a giant\nPokémon-like creature wreaking havoc.\c\nThere is a symbol resembling an α on each\nof the beast’s two arms...

Hey, you.\nIt gets awfully dark ahead.\r\nIt’ll be tough trying to explore.\c\nWell, for us Hikers, helping out those\nthat we meet is our motto.\c\nHere you go, I’ll pass this on to you.

Teach that TM Flash to a Pokémon and use it.\nIt lights up even the inky darkness of caves.
Hey, hey!\nCutting in line is no bueno.
The mural ahead...\c\nWe can’t figure out what’s painted\nthere, but that makes ruin enthusiasts\r\nlike me even more curious about it.\c\nIt looks as if a huge Pokémon is\npainted on it, but we’ve never seen\r\nsuch a Pokémon.\c\nIt’s sooooo intriguing and fascinating!
The mural ahead has drawn a lot of\nattention lately.\c\nThe other day, Team Something in red\nor blue suits came here in numbers.
A mural covers the entire wall.\nThe painting depicts the life of people and\r\ncreatures that look like Pokémon.

Grah, keelhaul it all!\c\nThis hostage Pokémon turned\nout to be worthless!\c\nAnd to think I made a getaway...\ninto this tunnel to nowhere!\c\nAnd you!\nNow you’re here to battle me. Really?
[~ 3]
This is plain not right...\c\nThe boss told me this would be\na slick-and-easy job to pull.\c\nAll I had to do was steal some\nparts from Devon.\c\nTch!\c\nYou want ’em back that badly,\nthen take ’em!
Peeko! Am I glad to see you’re safe!
My Peeko owes her life an’\nfreedom to you, la[VAR GENDBR(00FF,0201)]dss!\c\nThey call me Mr. Briney.\nAnd you are?
Ah, so it’s [VAR TRNAME(0000)], is it now!\nThen I sincerely thank you, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\c\nIf there’s ever a thing I can do to help you\nin turn, don’t you hesitate to tell me.\c\nIf I’m to be found, it will always be at my\ncottage by the sea near Petalburg Woods.
Come, Peeko!\nHigh time we’re under way to home!
Pikwee!
...\c\nWhy can’t I keep digging?\nIs the boulder too hard?\c\nMy beloved girlfriend lives in\nVerdanturf Town, just beyond here...\c\nIf Rustboro and Verdanturf were\njoined by this tunnel, I could visit\r\nher every day...\c\nBut this...\nWhat am I to do?
To get from Rustboro to Verdanturf,\nyou need to go to Dewford, then pass\r\nthrough Slateport and Mauville...
Wow! You shattered those boulders\nblocking the way.\c\nTo show you how much I appreciate it,\nI’d like you to have this!
I found that when I was digging for the tunnel.\c\nI felt like there’s some mysterious power coming\nfrom it, but I don’t think I could do a thing with it.
Wanda!\nNow I can see you anytime!
That’s...that’s wonderful!\c\nCome on. Let me take you to my place so\nyou can rest.
On the other side of this rock...\nMy boyfriend labors day after day.\c\nHe...he’s not just digging this\ntunnel to come see me.\c\nHe works his hands raw and rough\nfor the benefit of everyone.

[VAR TRNAME(0000)].\nWe have the Meteorite Shard.\c\nAnd I have come to understand many\nthings, as I suspected might happen.
[VAR TRNAME(0000)].\nWe have the Meteorite Shard.\c\nAnd I have come to understand many\nthings, as I suspected might happen.
Allow me to introduce you.\c\nThe honorable lady you see before you is a descendant\nof the ancient Draconids.
Yes, I am one of the Draconid people.\c\nOne of those ancient folk tasked with passing down\nthe knowledge of Mega Evolution—with the great lore\r\nof Lord Rayquaza, who was the beginning of all.
Since times long gone, Hoenn has repeatedly suffered\ngreat disasters.\c\nAt times, the destruction took the form of a\nhuge meteoroid, which fell upon our land from\r\ndistant space.\c\nAt other times, the Primal Reversions of our own\nsuper-ancient Pokémon brought us to the brink\r\nof destruction.\c\nEach time, Lord Rayquaza has saved us from doom.
The chosen Lorekeeper, standing before a stone\nthat shone with rainbow light, offered up a wish\r\nto the great one.\c\nAnd Lord Rayquaza’s body was suffused with a\nbrilliant light and transformed.\c\nIn its transformed state, Rayquaza’s power was more\ndevastating than ever before, overcoming even the\r\nsuper-ancient Pokémon with all their primal power.
A rainbow-colored stone...\nAn invocation from the Lorekeeper...\r\nAnd a Rayquaza unlike any ever seen...\c\nI see. It does resemble what we know of the process\nof Mega Evolution...
Yes, it does indeed.\c\nA Pokémon, a person, a stone of power.\nThe bonds that tie them all together...\c\nThe transformation of the Pokémon that occurs as a\nresult of this phenomenon was called “Mega Evolution”\r\nby later peoples.
So the mechanism for Mega Evolution was discovered\nas a result of the first meeting between humanity\r\nand Rayquaza...\c\nHmmmm.\nBut I have one last question.\c\nThat “Lorekeeper” you spoke of...
The Lorekeeper is the one who has inherited\nthe knowledge and power to summon Lord\r\nRayquaza when disaster imperils this world.\c\nThe true Lorekeeper of the current generation\nis the one called Zinnia.\c\nThe disaster that now approaches our planet,\nas it has twice before...\c\nZinnia has been trying for some time to avert it...\nin her own way.\c\nTo draw Lord Rayquaza to our sphere, she\njoined a certain organization that sought\r\nto revive the super-ancient Pokémon.\c\nShe taught them the secrets needed to bring\nback these threats and summon the great\r\nDragon itself.\c\nAnd now it seems she travels the land, scouring\nthe world for Key Stones...
So it was true...\c\nAs I had suspected, that woman who appeared\nat the Space Center was one of the Draconids...
But I never dreamed she was involved in the\nattempted revival of the super-ancient Pokémon...\c\nIn full knowledge of the power they held, fully\nunderstanding the terrible changes they would\r\nwreak upon our world...\c\nStill she helped bring that situation about?\c\nDid she give a thought to the many people and\nPokémon whose lives were put at grave risk\r\nby her actions?\c\nCould she accept the inevitable sacrifice of so\nmany lives, in order to protect the planet from\r\nthe coming meteoroid?
Balance must rule this world.\nHistory is doomed to repeat itself...\c\nWhile our people have overcome many disasters\nin the past, it was always through great, great sacrifice...\c\nYet we have continued to struggle to preserve peace\nfor as many years as we can.\c\nThat is how we have protected this world, upon which\nwe now live.\c\nPeople...\nPokémon...\r\nAll nature...\r\nAnd, yes, even you.\c\nI do not know exactly what you plan to do. But do you\nbelieve that you are not\r\nsacrificing anything for your own protection?\c\nZinnia will follow her convictions until the very end.\c\nEven knowing the sacrifices that they will require.\c\nEven if the sacrificial blade is leveled at her own heart.
...\c\nIs that right?\c\n...\nI understand.\c\nThank you for everything.
What is this...\nThis vague sense of apprehension...\r\nAnd my intuition has often proven true.\c\nI am going back to Rustboro first.\nI have to get back to Devon.
That silver-haired dreamboat said\nhe was headed back to Rustboro.

Let it go now.\c\nFor everything there must be an ending.\nOnly then...\r\nOnly then can there be a new beginning.\c\nThis is immutable truth that all living things\non this planet, great and small, must accept.\c\nWe Draconids have seen it in our history,\nas you have seen it in your own life.
Now is the time for rest.\c\nLet down the great burden you\nhave borne so long alone...\r\nSo that you might at last take a\r\nstep forward toward new life.\c\nNow is the time for rest...
...
...\c\nYes.
Child, you...
I heard of what happened from Zinnia.\nThe Draconids owe you much.\r\nThank you, child.
Zinnia has gone on a journey.\nA journey to find herself this time.
Ah, yes...\nShe did leave this for you, though.\r\nI hope you will accept it.
I wonder what kind of future\nZinnia might find for herself,\r\nnow that she is free from the\r\nfate of the Draconids.\c\nThough I don’t think that I\nneed worry about it.
Ah, yes.\nIf ever your Rayquaza forgets how to\r\nuse Dragon Ascent, come call upon me.\c\nI may not seem like much, but I am also\none of the last Draconids. I can help the\r\nDragon lord remember that grand move.

[VAR TRNAME(0000)] has changed into a Contest Costume!
I was watching the contest just now, and it was amazing!\nI’m so jealous! I wish I could perform like that!\c\nI don’t even have a [VAR COLOR(0002)]Contest Pass[VAR COLOR(0000)], though...
And that’s why I want you\nto give it your all for me, too.\r\nHere, take this.
I saw you doin’ your thing up there.\c\nIt looks like contests are all about Pokémon,\nbut the truth is that it’s the combination of\r\na Pokémon and its Trainer that matters most.\c\nYour Pokémon trusted your instructions\nabout how to appeal to the crowd.\c\nI could see the bond between\nyou and your Pokémon.
I wanna see you and your\nPokémon performing even better.\c\nLet me give you a hand.
I was watching that contest and\nfound it quite impressive indeed.\c\nBefore I knew it, I was spellbound.\nThank you for a lovely time.
I’m looking forward to your next performance.\nTake this as a symbol of my hopes for you.
I was fortunate enough to be able to view\nthe contest in which you just partook.\c\nAs a spectator of the contest, I am\nconfident of my taste and discernment.\c\nIt is my considered opinion that your\nperformance was dazzling!
I expect more excellence\nfrom you in the future!\c\nAlso, please be so kind as\nto wear that costume next time!
That contest was totally awesome!\c\nThe Pokémon came out all “Boom!”\nThen the crowd was all, like, “Whoa!”\c\nIt made me question my whole existence as a Picnicker.\nI’m a little distraught... That was fun, though!
I found this in the mountains.\nYou can have it!
Good job! Your Pokémon is so lovely!\c\nI do hope you’ll tell me sometime what\nyou’ve done to raise your Pokémon so well.
I’ll give you this.\n...OK?
Good gracious, what a contest!\nYour performance made the whole thing!\c\nI came down here from the mountains\nin the hope I could find something good.\c\nThanks for making my day!
Oh yeah! Let me give you something\nI found up in the mountains.
Hohoho! That was quite a nice contest just now.\c\nYou and your Pokémon were so dreadfully charming\nthat I simply couldn’t take my eyes off you.
I have nothing but this to offer you,\nbut would you be so gracious as to accept it?
You and your Pokémon...\nIt would appear that you possess some mysterious power.\c\nI found myself fascinated by it in spite of myself.\nThere must be something to this power!
I will bestow this upon you.\nStrive to further amplify your power!
You’ve got a nice team, don’t you?\nI was touched!\c\nEven adults want to feel the excitement of Pokémon.\nThanks for making it such a nice contest for us!
This is a reward from me.
That contest was excellent!\c\nWhen I see Pokémon giving their all to impress\nthe crowd like that, it makes me feel alive!
Of course I saw how hard you were trying, too.
I’ve been waiting for you! What an amazing performance!\c\nI really wanted to tell you that.\nPlease let me see your Pokémon again sometime.
I’ll give you this, then.\nIt’s a deal, OK?
You’re wonderful!\nI was moved!\c\nI felt the potential of Pokémon\nfor things other than battles.
This is for your Pokémon, so they\nmay shine even more brightly!
Hey! Hey, you! You were just in\nthat contest, weren’t you?\c\nLet’s see, how can I put this...\nIt was pretty good, wasn’t it?\c\nI thought you and your\n[VAR PKNICK(0000)] were great.
You can have this. Show me\nsomething great again next time!
I saw that contest that you\nand your Pokémon performed in.\c\nThere are some delightful attractions\nover here in the Hoenn region, too.
Oh yeah! As long as you’re here, take this.\nIt’s fine! It’s fine! Put this present to good use.
This is a portrait of [VAR PKNICK(0001)],\nwho performed well in the [VAR 01A2(0000)] Contest!
It looks like a place to display a portrait of a\nPokémon that performed well in a contest.
It’s a photo taken during the contest!
This looks like the place where a\ncontest photo can be displayed.
Which would you like to know about?
Contests
Conditions
Pokéblocks
Pokéblock Kits
Condition refers to how well a Pokémon\nis displaying the charms it possesses.\c\nYou can raise a Pokémon’s condition\nby feeding it Pokéblocks.\c\nAs long as you have Berries and a [VAR COLOR(0002)]Pokéblock Kit[VAR COLOR(0000)],\nyou can make Pokéblocks at any time.\c\nPokémon that have a high condition that\nmatches the contest’s title will get bonus\r\npoints in the Introduction Round.\c\nBe sure to raise the condition of whichever\ncontest you’d like to make a splash in!
A Pokéblock is a lovely snack that you can\nuse to raise your Pokémon’s condition.\c\nYou can make them by mixing together\nbetween two to four Berries.\c\nWhat kind of Pokéblock you make depends\non the kinds of Berries you use, and\r\ndifferent blocks raise different conditions.\c\nBy the way, there are supposedly Pokéblocks\nmade from very rare Berries, which\r\ngreatly raise a Pokémon’s condition!\c\nPlease try out many different combinations!
A [VAR COLOR(0002)]Pokéblock Kit[VAR COLOR(0000)] is a convenient tool\nthat lets you make Pokéblocks and\r\nfeed them to your Pokémon.\c\nYou can use a machine called a\nBerry Blender to make Pokéblocks.\c\nYou can organize Pokéblocks by what kind they\nare and store them in your Pokéblock Case.\r\nIt’s very convenient!
Welcome to the Pokémon Contest Spectacular!\nIt looks like you’ve brought your [VAR COLOR(0002)]Contest Pass[VAR COLOR(0000)].\c\nKeep on trying until you become a contest star!\nBefore we begin, some advice for first-timers...\c\nDuring the contest, your Pokémon will show\nthe audience just how lovely it is!\c\nFirst up is the [VAR COLOR(0002)]Introduction Round[VAR COLOR(0000)]!\c\nThe appearance of Pokémon that have raised their\nCoolness, Cuteness, or other conditions with\r\nPokéblocks will be judged.\c\nAfter the Introduction Round, it’s time for\nthe [VAR COLOR(0002)]Talent Round[VAR COLOR(0000)]!\c\nIt’s a competition to determine how well Pokémon\ncan use their moves over the course of five turns.\c\nUse moves that match the condition of the contest\nto make the audience go crazy!\c\nIf you check the moves of the Pokémon that you want\nto put in the contest, you can see that they’re split into\r\nfive different conditions, such as Coolness and Cuteness.\c\nIf you’re in a contest with the same title as that condition,\nyou can use that move to appeal to the crowd!\c\nAfter you place first in a [VAR COLOR(0002)]Normal Rank[VAR COLOR(0000)] contest,\nyou can win your way through higher ranks!\c\nVery well...
Right this way, please!
Congratulations!\c\n[VAR TRNAME(0000)]’s Pokémon performed the best!\nNext time, you can enter your Pokémon in the\r\n[VAR COLOR(0002)][VAR 01A4(0003)][VAR COLOR(0000)] of the [VAR COLOR(0002)][VAR 01A2(0002)] Contest[VAR COLOR(0000)]!

Yaaay!\nFinally, we all got to appear together!
[VAR TRNAME(0000)]! Let me introduce you!\nThis is my uncle, Wallace.\c\nUncle Wallace, this is the\n[VAR GENDBR(00FF,0403)]boygirl I was telling you about!
[VAR TRNAME(0000)]! Let me introduce you!\nThis is my uncle, Wallace.\c\nUncle Wallace, this is the\n[VAR GENDBR(00FF,0403)]boygirl I was telling you about!
No introductions necessary, Lisia.\nI would say that [VAR TRNAME(0000)] and I...\r\nknow each other quite well already.
Huh? You do?\c\nOh! I get it! You ARE a Gym Leader\nafter all, Uncle Wallace.\r\nSo you guys battled before?
[VAR GENDBR(00FF,0201)]HShe defeated me when we battled.\c\nAnd if that were not enough, [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0100)]she is\nalso a great Trainer who carried\r\nout splendid deeds for Hoenn.\r\nThat is who [VAR TRNAME(0000)] is.
You appear to be well.\c\nLisia has been so enraptured by\nthe contest spectacles that I felt\r\ncompelled to see them for myself.\c\nIt has been many years since I last\ntook part in the likes of a contest...\r\nAnd here I find you once more.
It is not only in my own Gym that\nyou have defeated me, but you\r\nhave bested me in contests as well.\c\nIt seems I still have much to learn...
Did you know... It was I who first instructed\nLisia in the ways of Pokémon contests.\c\nSomewhere along the way, it appears my\nlittle niece has surpassed her teacher.\c\nIt seems I still have much to learn...
I managed to seize victory\nfrom you and Lisia today,\r\nbut it was no easy thing.\c\nIt seems there is still more\nfor me to learn...
I certainly failed to show\noff my abilities today.\c\nPerhaps I’ve been away\ntoo many years...
Never mind, Uncle Wall!\nWe had fun and that’s what matters!
I suppose you’re right.
[VAR TRNAME(0000)], I’m sure you’ve\ngrown to understand this already.\c\nNo matter whether you stand in a\nPokémon Gym or Contest Hall, a\r\nTrainer who holds to h[VAR GENDBR(00FF,0202)]iser belief in\r\nthe Pokémon beside h[VAR GENDBR(00FF,0202)]imer...\c\nThe Pokémon that battles on, believing in\nthe Trainer with whom it stands together...\c\nThe settings may differ, but their labors come\nto fruition in a way that honors their bond!\r\nThere is equal beauty in both!
That’s a lovely thought, Uncle Wall.\nReally wonderful!
Yes...\nAnd confoundingly elegant!
And so very, very...
...Glorious!
You two have shown yourselves to be fine\nTrainers, with bright futures ahead of you.
What is it?
Tell me about Lisia.
So you did contests?
Nothing, really...
Lisia is the daughter of my elder sister\nand does not live in Sootopolis any longer.\c\nShe was tucked safely away during that\ninfamous incident, so she would probably\r\nbe quite shocked to learn your part in it.
Yes, I once tried my hand at contests.\c\nBut Lisia has a natural talent for them\nthat greatly surpasses mine.\r\nShe became an idol almost overnight.\c\nAs a result, I was able to apply myself\nfully to my role as Gym Leader.\c\nAfter this, I almost feel as though\nI should give contests another try.\c\nOr perhaps I should steal the title of\nPokémon League Champion from you.\r\nThat could be quite amusing...
I imagine Steven must be gnashing his teeth\nover missing today’s Contest Spectacular.
’Sup?
Tell me more about Wallace.
So about these contests...
Nothing, really...
Oh, yeah, you battled Uncle Wall, right?\nIs he really as strong as they say?\c\nAll his friends seem to be super-strong\nTrainers, too.\c\nLike that one guy obsessed with stones,\nor that Trainer who looks like a star...\c\nHmm. And you still beat him.\nI guess that means that...\r\nYou really are amazing, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!

And you still beat him.\nI guess that means that...\r\nYou really are amazing, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!
Yeah, it was because I saw my uncle\ndoing contests that I decided to try, too.\c\nHe’s my mentor. He taught me all about\ncompeting in contests!\c\nAnd Uncle Wall has a mentor of his own,\nnamed Juan...\c\nI wonder if someone will ever look up to\nme as a mentor. Who knows?
Today’s contest sure was fun!

Tee hee...\nI lost!
[VAR TRNAME(0000)], you and your Pokémon\nhave already gone beyond our reach.\c\nYou were totally amazing out there.\nAnd you’ve got tons of fans, too!\c\nYou’re a force to be reckoned with!
[VAR TRNAME(0000)], you and your Pokémon\nhave already gone beyond our reach.\c\nYou were totally amazing out there.\nAnd you’ve got tons of fans, too!\c\nYou’re a force to be reckoned with!
I said the other day that I wondered\nwhat made you so special...\c\nI think I’ve got a better idea now what it is.
I said the other day that I wondered\nwhat made you so special...\c\nI think I’ve got a better idea now what it is.
See... It’s probably ’cause you don’t\ndo just contests, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]...\c\nYou’re out there filling your Pokédex, taking on\nPokémon Gyms, and all kinds of other things!\r\nYou and your Pokémon shared all those experiences...\c\nThat’s why you can show off the real appeal of\nyour Pokémon better than any one of us can!

I’ve started thinking that\nI should do the same,\r\nGyms and Pokédex and all.
My, my, my. If that’s the case, then I’ll\nbe your rival in each of those as well!
Oh, Chaz!\nDid you come to say congratulations, too?
Would I do that?\c\nI still don’t see that this little squirt has\nanything special in the way of skills.\c\nHumph! I might beat you myself one of these\ndays, Lisia. And then I’d be just as good!\c\nThe only reason I’m here is to tell this\nupstart to watch out, because I’m next!\c\nMacherie, would you open the box?
Hee hee hee!\nTruth is you’re happy [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0100)]she won, huh?\c\nBut if you really want to beat me...
Then that means I have to beat all\nthe Master Rank contests. I know.\c\nI’ve decided to put Macherie in\nthe Toughness Contest.\c\nMacherie is cute, and even if she\ngets tougher, she’ll always be cute!\r\nShe’s my adorable Macherie, after all!
Machi!
It seems like she wants to try it out.\c\nWhen I watched [VAR TRNAME(0000)] winning\ncontest after contest like that, I realized it\r\nwas time to let go of my stupid hang-ups.
Chaz, that’s...
Anyway! Since we’ve decided to go\nfor it, me and Macherie are going all out\r\nin toughness training from now on!\c\nWe’ll challenge Gyms and do whatever it takes!\c\nWe’re headed for some strength training\nright after this, in fact...
Hey, Chaz.\nIt’s workout time!
Yo! Yessir!\nWe’ll be right there, Brawly, sir!
Oh, it’s you?\nI didn’t know you knew Chaz.
I’ve never watched a contest before,\nbut if you and Chaz are in it,\r\nI should watch at least one contest!\c\nOK, Chaz, let’s go!
Yessir!
Maaachi!
“I’m going to go get tougher, and then\nI’ll come back—so please wait for me, Ali!\c\nI’ve been acting like a fool...\c\nI thought just being near you was\nall I needed to be happy, but...\c\nWe’re each other’s best rivals, right?\nSo let’s put everything into it! Hee hee!”\c\n...Th-that’s what Macherie said, that\nsweet girl of mine!
Alalala...
“Yes! Give it your all!\nDon’t stop till you drop!”\c\nThat’s what Ali wants to say. Right, Ali?
Aliii?!
You two understand what Pokémon are saying?\nThat’s incredible!\c\nOK. Now we’re really leaving!
That Chaz...\nHe’s a pretty good guy after all.
Now it’s time you let me give\nyou a little something, too!\r\nThis marks the final chapter\r\nin the brilliant story of [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!

No holding back!\nLet’s both give it our all!
Hm? You want something?
Where were you?
What about your idol job?
No, it’s fine.
You wanna know where I’ve been?\c\nWell, duh! I’ve been getting ready\nso I could stand on stage with you!\c\nTee hee! Ali and I did a ton of special\ntraining so we’d be ready to shine!

It’s me, Chaz the a-a-a-a-awesome!\c\nHeh! No Lisia today—too bad for you!\c\nBut try not to look so disappointed. Sheesh.
Mamach! Machee?
Guess it’s too bad for you, too, Macherie.\nYou missed your chance to see Ali, huh?
Lisia’s spending all her time\npracticing moves with Ali lately.\c\nShe’s waiting for you to win all\nthe Master Rank contests.\r\nFor you to become a real contest star...\c\nShe says she wants to become better\nthan ever so she can do her best\r\nperformance together with you.\r\nThat’s why she’s trying so hard.\r\nShe’s practically never here anymore.
She looks like she’s having a lot of\nfun when she’s practicing, though.\c\nI guess she wants to show you\nsomething that’ll knock your socks off.\c\nHonestly...\c\nI really wanted it to be me.
But...\nIf you can’t win all Master Rank contests,\r\nyou’ll never be able to stand toe-to-toe with Lisia...\c\nBut you already know that, huh?\c\nM-me, I’ll never be able to stand toe-to-toe with her.
Maaah...
Cheer up, Macherie.\c\nYou’re my sweet and adorable girl!\nAnd that’s why I’ll never, ever make\r\nyou do a Toughness Contest!\r\nI can’t make a cutie like you\r\ntry to increase your Toughness!\c\nNo way!
I’m still the best rival for Lisia.\c\nI’m not wrong about that.\nBut it doesn’t mean that...well...\r\nthat you haven’t got a part to play, too.\c\nSo, um...you know...\nJust take this and give it your all.\c\nMacherie, could you open the box?
Lisia’s not the type to care about\nbeating somebody else or whatever...\c\nThe point is that the contest lets you\nshow off how fantastic your Pokémon are...\c\nGuess I’m saying...well...I’m behind you, too.
Cham cham!

Mach, mach!
Oh. Chaz. And Macherie.
I don’t think anyone would say I’ve been “pining”...\nAnd could you have picked a worse time to interrupt?

Yeah? I’m glad we get the chance\nto chat after contests, though.
Humph. Well, if you’re going to keep going\nin the contest world, you’d better do your\r\nbest on stage so you don’t embarrass Lisia.\r\nShe did scout you, after all!

Hmph! Good luck waiting\nfor me to be your fan!
Chaz!
Who is this supposed to be, Lisia?\c\nI’m meant to be your one and only rival!
Now look here.\nMaybe you don’t know this, but\r\nme and Lisia are the most famous\r\nrivals in the contest world!\c\nWhen we debuted together back in Lilycove,\nwe stood at the top of the lighthouse and\r\nswore that we would both do our best to win!\r\nWe talked the whole night, till dawn!\c\nWell, actually, we talked for about 40 minutes,\nbut it was still amazing!
Come on, Chaz!\c\nHow many times do I have to tell you\nthat there are no rivals in contests?\c\nIt’s not that kind of a competition!\c\nIt’s the combination of the Trainer and\nhis or her Pokémon that—
What’s wrong with being rivals?\nIt makes it more fun for the people\r\nwatching us. Don’t try to deny it!\c\nWhen people think of you, they think\nof me. And the other way around!
When they think of me,\nthey should think of Ali...
Well, that’s just the way things are.\nYou get it now, newbie?\r\nSorry that you got your hopes up and all,\r\nbut Lisia’s real rival will always be ME.\c\nThere’s no room for you in our dramatic\nstory of success and glory!
Oh, that Chaz!\nHe never listens!\c\nDon’t mind him, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].\nI’m not interested in rivals or stuff like that.\c\nI just want everyone to have fun together\nand enjoy Contest Spectaculars!

Yeah?\nWhat is it, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]?
Yeah?\nWhat is it, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]?
Tell me about Ali.
So about Chaz...
Nothing, really.
Some people say that “Ali” sounds like a\ngirl’s name, but my Ali is definitely a boy!\c\nI always think Ali’s the cutest, but\nthere’s more to him than that. When it\r\ncomes to contests, Ali really shines!\c\nWe’ve been doing our best together\never since he was a Swablu.\r\nI hope we’ll be partners forever!
About Chaz...\nHe’s a Trainer who made his debut\r\nin the contest world the same day I did.\c\nHe’s definitely a bit, um, unique...\nBut he works really hard at what he does.
Then I guess I’ll look forward\nto your next performance!

Hmm, lemme think...\nIt’d probably be easier for you to win if\r\nyou gave your Pokémon more Pokéblocks!\c\nPokéblocks are pretty important, since they\nlet you raise your Pokémon’s conditions!\c\nEven if your moves aren’t quite up to snuff,\nyou might still be able to squeak through in\r\na contest with good-enough conditions!\c\nHere, try making a Pokéblock from this, and\ngive it to your Pokémon for me, OK?

What? A battle?\c\nOooh... Truth is, I’m not\nall that hot at battles...\c\nBut don’t you worry!\nMaybe I’ll get to take you\r\non in a contest someday!
I started in contests because I wanted to\nshow people that there’s this whole other\r\namazing side to Pokémon, more than\r\nwhat you see in battles or whatever.\c\nPokémon are about more than strength.\nYou can raise ’em to be beautiful, or\r\nyou can raise ’em to be tough as nails.\c\nThey grow and change, trying as hard as\nthey can to live up to their Trainer’s feelings.
Ali! Altari!
I want the whole world to get it about all\nthe other cool aspects of raising Pokémon!\c\nThat’s why Ali and I\nset out to become stars!\c\nWhen you’re a star, and everyone starts\nfollowing you, then they naturally start\r\nwanting to know more about contests, too.\r\nAm I right?
See, that’s why I started thinking that a\nTrainer shouldn’t just depend on Pokémon.\c\nThe Trainer’s gotta be just as cute, or just as cool,\nto stand alongside their awesome Pokémon!
Oopsies! Sorry again!\nI probably went on too much...
You gotta win again\nnext time, OK?

Welcome, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].
Welcome, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].
I was hoping I would get to\nsee you make it here one day.
Tell me...\c\nWhat have you seen on your\njourney with your Pokémon?
What have you felt, meeting so\nmany other Trainers out there?
Traveling this rich land of Hoenn...\nHas it awoken something inside you?\c\nI want you to come at me with all\nthat you’ve learned.\c\nMy Pokémon and I will respond in\nturn with all that we know!
Let it begin!
[~ 7]
Just as I have come to expect.\c\n[VAR TRNAME(0000)], you are truly an\nexcellent Pokémon Trainer.\c\nCongratulations to you!
And thank you...\c\nI had wanted to learn how\nyou feel about this world,\r\nwhat kinds of ideals you have\r\ndeveloped with your Pokémon...\c\nI feel I was able to find\nthe answer in our battle.
The feelings you have for your Pokémon...\c\nAnd the way that your Pokémon gave their\nall in battle in response to those feelings...
Those two together created a great power.\c\nThat is how you seized victory today.
I felt a thrill of excitement in my breast when\nwe first met, and now I know for sure that\r\nfeeling was not misplaced!\c\nYou are rightfully the Hoenn region’s new...
[VAR TRNAME(0000)], wait!\c\nI’ve got some advice you’ve got to hear\nbefore you challenge the Champion...
Huh? Wait—what? What?\c\n[VAR TRNAME(0000)]...\nCould it be that...\r\nIt’s already over?
[VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\c\nBefore you go to challenge the Champion,\nI’ve got one last thing you’ve got to...
[VAR TRNAME(0000)]...\c\nYou didn’t... No, you couldn’t have...\c\nDid you already beat the Champion?!
See? What did I say, May?\c\nDidn’t I tell you that [VAR TRNAME(0000)]\nwould be just fine?
See? What did I say, Brendan?\c\nDidn’t I tell you that [VAR TRNAME(0000)]\nwould be just fine?
[VAR TRNAME(0000)], you’ve finally done it.\c\nWhen I heard that you defeated your\nown father at the Petalburg Gym,\r\nI thought perhaps you had a chance...\c\nBut to think you’ve actually become\nthe Champion!
[VAR TRNAME(0000)], you’ve finally done it.\c\nWhen I heard that you defeated your\nown father at the Petalburg Gym,\r\nI thought perhaps you had a chance...\c\nBut to think you’ve actually become\nthe Champion!
[~ 21]
But congratulations on today’s victory!\c\nNow go in there with your head held high!
[VAR TRNAME(0000)]...\c\nNo, I should call you the Hoenn region’s\nnew Pokémon League Champion...\c\nCome with me, Champion.
[VAR TRNAME(0000)]...\c\nNo, I should call you the Hoenn region’s\nnew Pokémon League Champion...\c\nCome with me, Champion.
I’m very sorry...
But only a Trainer who has successfully become\nthe Champion may go beyond this point.\c\nYou’ll need to wait outside with the professor.
No waaay!
...
Just joking! It’s OK! It’s fine!\c\nRules are rules, right?
[VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\nHonestly, congratulations!
Wha—
...
Can’t be helped, I guess.\nThem’s the rules, right?
That’s awesome, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].\nCongratulations...really!
Welcome back, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].
Welcome back, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].
I just thought, you know, that since we were\nboth here and all...that I’d wait for you.
I just, uh, you know...
We set out on this journey together, right?\nSo maybe we should finish it together, too.
We set out on this journey together, right?\nSo maybe we should finish it together, too.
Hee hee...
D-don’t go trying to read\nanything into it, though!
So...come on! Let’s go home!\nBack to Littleroot Town!
Now, come on! We’re going home!\nBack to Littleroot Town!
I still owe you for your help at the Sky Pillar.\nThank you for that.
Hahaha!\c\nHow unlike you to be so thoughtful.
Heh...\c\nYou know, this experience really brought it home for\nme again...\c\nThat there is still so much about this world that I do\nnot know.
I wonder what would have happened to Hoenn...\c\nIf [VAR TRNAME(0000)] had not been here to aid us with this,\nand the incident with the super-ancient Pokémon...\r\nI alone was powerless to stop either.
I wonder what would have happened to Hoenn...\c\nIf [VAR TRNAME(0000)] had not been here to aid us with this,\nand the incident with the super-ancient Pokémon...\r\nI alone was powerless to stop either.
There is no one person in this world who knows all.\nNone who can do all.\c\nSteven... There is no cause for such worries or concern.
Hmm. Heh.\c\nDon’t worry. It’s not that I am so shocked\nby my own disappointing performance.\r\nBut rather...
Rather what?
I was just thinking how much more there is\nI must learn about nature...about Pokémon...\r\nand about my fellow humans as well...\r\nIf I am to keep living in this huge, wide world.
I want to walk this world on my own two feet.\nTo see it with my own eyes.\r\nTo feel it on my very skin...
I need to put into practice all of the advice I ever\ngave to [VAR TRNAME(0000)].\r\nThat’s what I am thinking now.
I need to put into practice all of the\nadvice I ever gave to [VAR TRNAME(0000)].\r\nThat’s what I am thinking now.
...?\c\nSteven...\nYou can’t intend to...
Hah hah hah!\nBut no need to fear...\r\nI won’t just disappear at once.\c\nI’ll still be around doing my duty on behalf of\nthe Pokémon League.
But, hmm...\c\nWhen the time does come for me to pursue my\nown hopes...
Well... I hope that you, Wallace, will be behind me to\nlend a hand.
...
Hmph. It seems I have little choice.\c\nI bow to the whims of the pampered heir.\nI, Wallace, will do this thing you wish.
Heh.
Hah hah hah...\nThank you, my friend...
Now then...\c\nThere are no words left for us to exchange.\nWe will understand one another through battle!
I knew you would be strong...\c\nBut I don’t regret our battle.\c\nBecause each time that I battle you,\nI learn more about Pokémon...\c\nYes...\c\nI have something I’d like to give to\nyou in thanks for all you’ve done.
That is a very special piece from\nmy collection...\c\nBut I think you are capable of\nappreciating its worth.
Come.\nIt is time we record your great victory.
Welcome, Champion.\c\nLet me test my skills\nagainst you once again!
In the end, you are still\nthe strongest. Amazing.\c\nNow let us make a record\nof your victory!
Just as I have come to expect.\c\n[VAR TRNAME(0000)], you are truly an\nexcellent Pokémon Trainer.\c\nCongratulations to you!

I am the last of the Pokémon League Elite Four,\nDrake the Dragon master!
In their natural state, Pokémon are wild living things.\nThey are free.\c\nAt times, they hinder us.\nAt times, they help us.
For us to battle alongside Pokémon as partners, do you\nknow what it takes?\c\nDo you know what is needed?
If you don’t, you will\nnever prevail over me!
[~ 4]
You deserve every credit for coming this far as a\nPokémon Trainer.\c\nYou do seem to know what is needed.
Yes, what a Trainer needs is a true and virtuous heart.\c\nIt is through their contact with Trainers that Pokémon\nlearn right from wrong.\c\nThe influence of their Trainers’ good hearts helps them\ngrow strong!
Go! Go onward!\nThe Champion is waiting!
Oh, I’ve been waitin’ for you!\c\nMy Pokémon and I are going to\nshow you everything we’ve got!\c\nWell then, you had better\nget ready to try and stop me!
I got a glimpse inside your heart!\nThere’s nothing for me to say to you!\c\nGo forth, Trainer!\nGo on to your next challenge\r\nwith your head held high!

Welcome.\nMy name is Glacia of the Elite Four.\c\nI’ve traveled from afar to Hoenn so that I may hone my\nIce-type moves.
But all I have seen are challenges by weak Trainers\nand their Pokémon.
I wonder what you will show me.
What a relief it would be if I could, for once,\nhave a serious battle against an opponent!
[~ 4]
You and your Pokémon...\c\nHow fiercely your spirits burn!\c\nMy icy moves pale in the face of such\nall-consuming flames.
Advance to the next room.\c\nThere you will learn how fearsome the Pokémon League\ncan truly be!
I’ve been waiting for a Trainer\nwith a burning-hot soul.\c\nHow can you oppose Mega Evolution\nthat can freeze everything?
Hmmph...\nDo you intend to thaw my very heart?\c\nThat actually wouldn’t bother me.\c\nAnyway, continue onward!\nDrake is waiting for you as well.

Hahaha!
I’m Phoebe of the Elite Four.
I did my training on Mt. Pyre.\c\nWhile I trained there, I gained the ability\nto commune with Ghost-type Pokémon.
The bond I developed with my Pokémon is\nextremely tight.
Come on! Just try and see if you can even inflict\ndamage on my Pokémon!
[~ 5]
There’s definitely a bond between you and\nyour Pokémon, too.\c\nI didn’t recognize that fact, so it’s only natural\nthat I lost.
Yup, I’d like to see how far your bond will carry you.
Go ahead. Move on to the next room.
Ahaha! I’ve been waiting for you!\nI’m bringing a little something new to the table\r\nthis time! Prepare yourself and bring it on!
Hmmp, what a shame.\nI lost again, huh?\c\nBut on the bright side...\nWe fought together, so the bonds between\r\nmy Pokémon and me got even deeper!\c\nI look forward to being able to\nbattle you again sometime!

Welcome, challenger!\nI’m Sidney of the Elite Four.
I like that look you’re giving me.\nI guess you’ll give me a good match.\r\nThat’s good! Looking real good!
All right!\nLet’s get down to the kind of battle that can\r\nhappen only here in the Pokémon League!
[~ 3]
Well, listen to what this loser has to say.\c\nYou’ve got what it takes to go a long way!
Go on to the next room and challenge your next battle!
Yo! I’ve been waiting for you, Champion!\c\nWith the strength you’ve gained,\nwe can battle with no holds barred!\c\nNot to mention, our boy Steven sent\nus Elite Four some Key Stones!\c\nIn other words, my Pokémon\ncan Mega Evolve, too...\c\nHeh heh...\nThis one’s gonna be fun!
I was waiting for you, Champion.\c\nNo matter who wins, no hard feelings!\nLet’s get our most excellent battle underway!
Heh...\nI knew you really were the strongest...\c\nWell, hurry up and get out of here!\nEverybody else is still waiting for you!

The Pokémon League is just beyond Victory Road.\c\nIf you’ve come this far, what choice do you have\nbut to keep going?
The long and harrowing trip down Victory Road...\c\nIt’s like reliving the path one has traveled in life...
You! Young [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0403)]manlady!\nBelieve in your Pokémon and take your best shot!
Aha! Pokémon Journal\c\nIf you use Trick Room after Trick Room is used, the\nPokémon with the higher Speed stat can attack first again.
The Victory Road is the place where many\nstrong Trainers gather from all over the world.\c\nThey use Pokémon from other regions\nas well as from Hoenn, so we can’t let our\r\nguard down even for a second!

Do you know the Pokémon Shroomish?\nIt’s hardly ever seen in Sootopolis.\c\nAnyway, I love to play with my Shroomish\nin Pokémon-Amie!\c\nMy younger brother says Barboach is cuter.\c\nThat’s silly. Shroomish is cuter.\nThere’s no doubt about it.\c\nHuh? Do you have a Shroomish?\nP-p-please, show it to me!
Oh, now this is quite something... Hold on!\nThis is not a Shroomish!
It’s a Barboach!\nYou’re so mean!
You don’t have a Shroomish?\nThat’s too bad...\c\nPlease show me your affectionate\nShroomish next time.
Oh, Shroomish!\c\nHmmm... But my Shroomish is more\naffectionate and cuter than yours.
Wow! This Shroomish is so cute!\c\nAnd your Shroomish is very\naffectionate toward you, too!
Hm. Hmmm...\c\nThis Shroomish is certainly cute...\nI hate to admit it, but it looks as\r\naffectionate as my Barboach, too.
Thank you for showing it to us.\nAs a token of thanks, please take this!
Ah...\nPokémon-Amie is the best!\r\nShroomish is the best!
Ah...\nPokémon-Amie is the best!\r\nShroomish is the best!\r\nBarboach is pretty good, too!
Do you know the Pokémon Barboach?\nIt’s rarely seen in Sootopolis.\c\nI love to play with my Barboach\nin Pokémon-Amie.\c\nMy big brother says Shroomish is cuter.\c\nBut that’s wrong. Everybody knows\nBarboach is cuter!\c\nHunh? Do you have a Barboach?\nP-p-please show it to me!
Oh, now this is quite something... No!\nThis is not a Barboach!
It’s a Shroomish!\nYou’re terrible!
Don’t you have a Barboach?\nHow disappointing...\c\nPlease show me your affectionate\nBarboach next time!
Wow, Barboach!\c\nHmmm... But my Barboach is more\naffectionate and cuter than yours.
Wow! This Barboach is so cute!\c\nAnd your Barboach is very\naffectionate toward you, too!
Hm. Hmm...\c\nThis Barboach is surely cute...\nI hate to admit it, but it looks as\r\naffectionate as my Shroomish.
Thank you for showing it to me.\nI’ll give you this as a token of my appreciation!
Ah...\nPokémon-Amie is the best!\r\nBarboach is the best!

This crater was created when a huge meteoroid\ncrashed into the earth here...\c\nOver time, the crater filled with rainwater, and\nthat is how the city of Sootopolis came to be.

Listen up, my [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0403)]boygirl, and I’ll share something worth hearing.\nPeople say there’s an ancient ruin in the sea around here.\c\nThere could be lost treasure waiting to be discovered!
Yes, ancient treasure...\nIt would be cool if it existed!\c\nBut even if there’s no treasure to be found, going on\nan underwater stroll with my Pokémon is cool in itself!

You’re a Pokémon Trainer, aren’t you?\nSootopolis’s Gym Leader, Wallace, has a lot of fans.\c\nDo you have any fans?
Ohhh... Then you must be pretty strong.
Oh dear...\nThat’s kinda sad.\c\nPut a little work into getting your own fan following!
Dedicated fans flock in, even from as far away\nas the Kanto and Johto regions.\c\nHe must be the coolest Water-type Gym Leader\nin the world!

Wallace, this city’s Gym Leader, is a powerful Trainer.\nThe best in the whole Hoenn region, people say.\c\nBut the Elite Four and the Champion are said\nto be even stronger! How strong could they be?
The whole town has taken refuge,\nand nobody will leave their home.\c\nThis weather...\nCould it be the prelude to something?\c\nPeople were mentioning an old legend\nor something...
Whenever, wherever, and whatever happens,\nI will always be friends with my Pokémon.\c\nBecause it’s fun to be with Pokémon!
I don’t know why...\nBut...I’m really scared...\c\nMmn. I think I’ll watch some BuzzNav\nand calm myself down...

Allow me to formally introduce myself.
I am Wallace.\nThe Gym Leader of Sootopolis City.
There’s something about you...\nA difference in your demeanor...
I think I sense that in you.
What happened inside the Cave of Origin,\nand what you did there...\r\nOur upcoming battle will make that all clear.
Now, show me. Show me the power\nyou wield with your Pokémon.
And I, in turn, shall present you...
with a performance of illusions\nin water...
by me and my Pokémon!
[~ 37]
I realize now your authenticity and magnificence\nas a Pokémon Trainer.
I find much joy in having met you and your Pokémon.
You have proven yourself worthy of the Rain Badge.
Accept it.
[VAR TRNAME(0000)] received the Rain Badge\nfrom Wallace.
Having that Badge assures you full obedience of all\nyour Pokémon to every command you make.
And so you never forget the battle we shared...
Here...
The HM I have given you contains Waterfall.\c\nIt allows you to smash into an opponent with\nthe force required to climb a waterfall itself.\r\nYes, it is a mighty move...\c\nAnd yet it also has a certain elegance and\ncan sometimes cause opponents to flinch.
Now, with the power of the Rain Badge, you\nwill become able to use this HM move,\r\nWaterfall, to scale walls of cascading water.
Many paths are open to you now.
One path would take you to the Pokémon League.\c\nIt is the goal that all Trainers in Hoenn aspire to reach\nafter obtaining all eight Gym Badges.\c\nIf that is the path you chose, then you must find your way\nto the island said to be the most remote in Hoenn:\r\n[VAR COLOR(0002)]Ever Grande[VAR COLOR(0000)].
But if it is a different path you seek, and you would rather\npursue Pokémon and a completed Pokédex...\c\nThe rumors that reach me on the wind whisper that\nProfessor Birch in [VAR COLOR(0002)]Littleroot [VAR COLOR(0000)]has created a more\r\npowerful Pokédex.\c\nVisit him, obtain this new technology, and I have little\ndoubt you will encounter more diverse Pokémon than\r\never before.\c\n...I will hope that a bright future waits for you,\nwhatever path it is you choose.

Who might you be?
This is the Cave of Origin.\c\nThe spirits of Pokémon, becalmed at\nMt. Pyre, are said to be revived here.
Please leave.
...
Team Magma...and Team Aqua...
We’ve been waiting, ya scamp!
Leader Maxie...\c\nto that child...?
...I know what must be done.
I will entrust this to you now.\c\nIt is the fruit of our collaboration\nwith the Devon Corporation, and\r\nit represents the height of Hoenn’s\r\ntechnological knowledge and skill.
We had actually been preparing that in\nanticipation of making contact with Groudon...\c\nBut at this point, it doesn’t look like\nthere’s any hope of that for us...\r\nThere’s nothing we can do except leave it to you.
And yet...\c\nEven with that Magma Suit, is it probable that\nanyone could pass through that magma, now\r\nfiercer than ever due to the forces of nature?
That’s true.\c\nIt is very possible that its energy could\nbe far greater than our calculations show.
There is nothing to fear.
The Blue Orb he bears...\c\nIts ancient powers will protect\nboth the boy and his Pokémon.
The Blue Orb she bears...\c\nIts ancient powers will protect\nboth the girl and her Pokémon.
You’ve hit the nail on the head!\c\nThose old folks at Mt. Pyre did say\nsomething about that...\c\nThat the Red Orb would unleash\nGroudon’s primal powers...\r\nAnd trigger a Primal Reversion.\c\n...While the Blue Orb had the power\nto reverse that and calm the beast.
Yes. The energy overflowing from\nthe Cave of Origin just now...\c\nIt is the same energy that gives\nGroudon its power...\c\nWith the Blue Orb, which contains\nthe power to suppress that...\c\nIt should be possible to calm the\nrage of this flood of magma.
Of course the Blue Orb’s power alone\nwill not lead you to where Groudon waits.\r\nYou will not reach Hoenn’s Core that way.
[VAR TRNAME(0000)]...\nTo think that you had the Blue Orb...
[VAR TRNAME(0000)]...\nTo think that you had the Blue Orb...
You’ll be OK.\c\nYou and your Pokémon can\nhandle it, whatever happens.
I believe that.
No man or woman from Sootopolis is\npermitted to enter the Cave of Origin.
But you must go, together with your Blue Orb.
You must go regardless of what\nwaits for you inside that cave...
We’ll also get our people together up top here,\nto help any folks and Pokémon in trouble.
Child, you...\c\nNo. I have no right to call you “child.”\c\nFellow Trainer. I have caused great harm,\nand for that I apologize most sincerely.\c\nBut now we find ourselves at an impasse,\nand you and your Pokémon are all that\r\nhumanity has to count on in its stand\r\nagainst Groudon...
[VAR TRNAME(0000)]!
[VAR TRNAME(0000)]!
I heard on the news that things were going haywire\naround Sootopolis...\c\nAnd then I saw you on BuzzNav, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\c\nI couldn’t sit there and do nothing when I knew\nyou were here in the thick of it, so I came flying!
When I saw the news about Sootopolis on\nBuzzNav, and there you were, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]...\r\nAnyway, all I could think of was coming to help!\c\nYou don’t know how glad I am to see that you’re\nstill in one piece.
Bwuh?\nIsn’t that Team Magma? And Team Aqua?!\c\n...OK, can I just say that I am, like, shocked\nand confused on so many levels right now?
Bwuh?\nIs that Team Magma? And Team Aqua?!\c\n...OK, I don’t really know what to say\nright now, but I’m kind of dumbfounded.
This is probably something way\nbigger than I can imagine, isn’t it?\c\nSo I’m not even going to ask right now.
Look, I get that this is probably something\nway bigger than I’ve ever imagined...\c\nSo I won’t bother with any questions now.
I’m going to try to find what I can do to help,\nand then I’m going to do my best with that.\c\nAnd I’m going to keep on hoping and believing\nthat y-you’ll be OK out there, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].
I’m gonna find out what I should do to help,\nand then I’m going to do whatever I can.\c\nYou’d better do the same, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].
You alone must go.\nYou and your Blue Orb.\c\nYou must go regardless of what\nmay wait for you inside that cave.
You’ll be OK.\c\nYou and your Pokémon can\nhandle it, whatever happens.\c\nI believe that.
We’ll also get our people together up top here,\nto help any folks and Pokémon in trouble.\c\nMy little scamp of a savior...\c\nLooks like we’re dumping the whole burden on\nyour wee shoulders. Sorry it has to be that way.\r\nBut I know you’re gonna see this to the end!
Fellow Trainer. I have caused great harm,\nand for that I apologize most sincerely.\r\nBut now we find ourselves at an impasse.\c\nYou and your Pokémon are all that humanity\nhas to count on in its stand against Groudon...\c\nThe fate of our world...\nThe world upon which all humanity thrives...\c\nThe fate of our world rests in your hands!
All right!\c\nNow is the time for us to carve out a\nnew future with our scientific prowess!\c\nFor the pride of Team Magma,\nwe will struggle ferociously!
I’m going to try to find what I can do to help,\nand then I’m going to do my best with that.\c\nAnd I’m going to keep on hoping and believing\nthat you’ll be OK out there, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].\c\nPlease...give it everything you’ve got!
I’m gonna find out what I should do to help,\nand then I’m going to do whatever I can.\c\nYou’d better go do the same, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].\c\n...And I’ll always be right there behind you.\c\nA-after all, we’re friends, right?
[VAR TRNAME(0000)]!!!
[VAR TRNAME(0000)]!
It’s really over, isn’t it...
So it’s all over...
[VAR TRNAME(0000)], we owe you great thanks.
[VAR TRNAME(0000)], we owe you great thanks.
Look above you.\c\nThe sky over Sootopolis\nhas returned to normal.
Somehow, it’s...so warm...
Is the energy that had been amassed deep\nwithin the Cave of Origin now flowing out\r\nto pour over the greater world?
It’s as if the uncertainty and fear from\nmoments ago never even existed.\c\nMy heart feels like it’s\nbeen softly set at ease...
...\c\nThe sea or the land...\c\nPokémon or humanity...\c\nAll this time we’ve just been trying to\ngrab onto happiness for one of them,\r\neven if it meant destroying the other...
...\c\nI suppose...you may be right...
However...\c\nPersonally, in my case...
Some wrongs cannot be atoned for,\nno matter how you try to right them.\c\nAnd I have committed wrongs so great\nas to bring the whole world to its knees.\r\nIt may be that I...\c\nIt may be too much to assume that I should\ndeserve the chance to start anything over.
Leader...\c\nWithout a doubt, you have committed\nan offense that can never be forgiven.\c\nYou have wronged not only Team Magma\nbut all living things on this planet,\r\nwhether great or small.
However, that is precisely why\nyou must now set things right.\c\nYou must continue to atone for\nthe sins you have committed,\r\neven at the risk of your own life...
T-Tabitha...
...\c\nThank you.
Y’know...\c\nSomeday we adults are gonna have to hand this world\noff to this little scamp and the rest of h[VAR GENDBR(00FF,0202)]iser generation.\c\nBut what kinda world are we adults gonna make?\nWhat kinda world do we wanna pass to these kids?\c\nIf we haven’t even figured that out ourselves,\nwe’re never gonna get anywhere.\c\nSo are we gonna make a world where everyone\ncan coexist together?\c\nOr, after all, is it gonna be a world that we claim\nby force? One that we fight and scrabble over...\c\nI don’t know, but I think we can at least start by\ngiving it some time and thinking it over.\c\nAll of us can do that, whether we’re Team Aqua\nor Team Magma or whatever...
You were able to use that Blue Orb to great effect,\nso I imagine you will also be able to handle this.\c\nHave Groudon hold it, and you should be able to\ncontrol its Primal Reversion for at least a short period,\r\nsuch as during a battle.
And that’s it from me!\nLater, scamp!
Farewell.
...\c\nTeam Magma and Team Aqua are made up\nof people with completely opposing ideals\r\nand goals.\c\nBut perhaps even they can learn to meet\nhalfway...one small concession at a time.
I know it’s too much to expect that\neverything will change at once, but...
I hope this crisis might at least help\nthem take that first vital step forward.
[~ 69]
[~ 70]
[~ 71]
[~ 72]
[~ 73]
I imagine that many changes are\nhappening now all across Hoenn.\c\nI hope you will be able to travel this world\nand see its richness with your own eyes—\r\nand revel in its newness in your own heart.
But for the present, you may first wish to\nchallenge this city’s Pokémon Gym.\c\nThere, you’ll find the very same Wallace\nwho helped us so much waiting for you.\c\nHe’s strong.\c\nBut the way you are now, you should be\ncapable of battling him on an equal footing.
People, Pokémon, nature itself...\nOur survival in this world depends on\r\nall of us living together in harmony.\c\nI feel I have just begun to understand that.\c\nAnd I’m wondering how the world will\ncontinue to change from this point on...\r\nIt fills me with an inexplicable excitement.
[VAR TRNAME(0000)]...
[VAR TRNAME(0000)]...
As you and your Pokémon live\nand grow in this changed world,\r\nI wonder what effect it will have on you.\c\nWhat will you think about?\nWhat ideals will you believe in?
Until then...
Phew!\c\nFinally, it’s just the two of us again.\c\nI’ve got to say...thanks for everything\nyou’ve done for our region, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].
Phew!\c\nIt feels like we can finally relax, huh?\c\nI guess that now’s the time to say\nthanks for all you’ve done, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].
Anyway, you did something really amazing\ntoday, so try to take it easy for a while!
But...well, you did do something pretty amazing.\nSo take it easy for a while, OK, buddy?
See you later!
Later!
The Cave of Origin, where all things begin...\nMt. Pyre, where all things come to an end...\c\nPokémon and humans both...\nWhere do we come from? Where are we going?
The legend told by the old man on Mt. Pyre...\nIt wasn’t a made-up story after all...
The natural balance of things is going\nthrough a wrenching shift here in Hoenn...
What a...glorious turn of events...
Is it really?\nOhohohoho! Is it really?
To think that this tree...\c\nI never knew we had received it from that\nhuge man who visited from the Kalos region...
Goodness me, old master.\nThis has been a learning experience.\r\nI thank you for this.
Ohoho!\nYou’re too kind, Master Wallace!\r\nOhohohoho!
No, no, you’re too modest.\nHah hah hah...\c\nNow then...
Welcome again to Sootopolis,\nour new Champion, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].\c\nSteven has told me everything.\nDo you wish to go to the Sky Pillar?
It is true the cave that leads to the Sky Pillar can only\nbe opened by the hand of someone descended from\r\nthe ancient people of Sootopolis...as, indeed, am I.
Or by one of the Draconids, who have also\nlived in Hoenn since ancient times...
The Sky Pillar is in fact an altar built for the ascension\nof Rayquaza—that Legendary Pokémon long said to\r\nbe the protector of the Hoenn region.
Only the ancient Draconid people know how to summon\nRayquaza to the Sky Pillar.\c\nSteven has told me of the woman Zinnia.\c\nShe must be trying to revive Rayquaza for some purpose.
I shall go first to the Sky Pillar.\c\nWhen your preparations are\ncomplete, come join me.\c\nThe Sky Pillar towers over everything upon\none of [VAR COLOR(0002)]Route 131[VAR COLOR(0000)]’s [VAR COLOR(0002)]small islands[VAR COLOR(0000)].
Young Master Wallace headed to\nthe Sky Pillar a short while ago.\c\nThe Sky Pillar lies on [VAR COLOR(0002)]a small[VAR COLOR(0000)]\n[VAR COLOR(0002)]island[VAR COLOR(0000)] floating along [VAR COLOR(0002)]Route 131[VAR COLOR(0000)].
Ohhh! You there! Young’un!\nYou’re the one who saved Sootopolis—\r\nNo, you’re the one who saved all Hoenn!\c\nOf all things! I really...\nI really must thank you most sincerely.\c\nI swear I will live what time I have left in\nthis life to the fullest, thanks to you.
And when you travel the world,\nyou should try to use this.\c\nThis flute is one of my favorite items.
This [VAR COLOR(0002)]Eon Flute [VAR COLOR(0000)]is proof of the bond between you\nand your Latios.
No matter how far you may be from one another,\nplay that flute and Latios will surely fly straight to you.
Then it can take to the sky, soaring above\nthe land with you astride its back.\c\nYes, just like when we first encountered\nLatias and Latios at Southern Island...
Look at how things have turned out, now\nthe world’s got its natural balance back...\c\nWe’ve got to rethink this thing from the\nvery start...\c\nWe’ve got to redo everything we’ve done\nfrom scratch—and get it right this time.\c\nWhaddaya say?\nMaxie...
To set right the wrongs you’ve done,\nwithout running away in fear—\r\nisn’t that how an adult accepts responsibility?
...\c\nShould you find the resolve to\ndo so inside yourself, then I...\c\nTeam Magma Admin Tabitha...
I will serve at your side as counsel forever.
If we do get the chance to meet again,\nI hope you will be able to show me and\r\nmy team the answers you’ve found.
You know, I thought we were supposed to\nhave set out from Littleroot together, but...\c\nBut you, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]...\c\nIt seems like you just keep getting further\nand further ahead of me...\c\nI even started to feel like you’d gone\nsomewhere that I can’t even reach.
It’s pretty lonely, you know?
Not!\c\nWhat would you think if I really said\nsomething like that?\c\nHee hee!
You know, we set out from Littleroot\nat the same time, but...\c\nIt seems like you’re just dashing ahead\nby yourself and leaving me behind...\c\nI feel like we’re not even on the same\nlevel anymore, you know?
...\c\nIt’s kinda lonely thinking like that...
Or it would be if I really thought that!
Use the suit that you were just given.\c\nWith that, it will finally become possible\nto stand up against the forces of nature.
My little scamp of a savior...\c\nLooks like we’re making you bear all the burden\non your little shoulders alone. I’m sorry for that.\r\n...But I know you’re going to see this through!
The fate of our world...\nThe world upon which all humanity thrives...\c\nThe fate of our world rests in your hands!
Because...
Because you...\nYou’re the best friend I have!
I’ll always be right there behind you.
You’re my best friend, after all!

Who might you be?
This is the Cave of Origin.\c\nThe spirits of Pokémon, becalmed at\nMt. Pyre, are said to be revived here.
Please leave.
...
Team Aqua...and Team Magma...
We have been expecting you.
Archie...\c\nI’m going to hand over that\nthing we developed to this kid.\r\nAll right?
Yes.
The Aqua Suit.\nTake it...
This super high-performance protective suit\nwas made with the combined technology\r\nof the Devon Corporation and Team Aqua!\c\nWe actually prepared it in anticipation of\ncoming into contact with Kyogre.\c\nI’ll just leave it with you.
But...\c\nEven if you put that thing on, do you\nreally think you’ll be able to make it all\r\nthe way down to where Kyogre waits?
The energy overflowing from this\nshrine is certainly much more powerful\r\nthan we had anticipated.\c\nIts influence is making\nthe current grow stronger.
There is nothing to fear.
The Red Orb he bears...\c\nIts ancient powers will protect\nboth the boy and his Pokémon.
The Red Orb she bears...\c\nIts ancient powers will protect\nboth the girl and her Pokémon.
Hmph! So that’s it!\c\nNow that you mention it, I do remember the\nelderly couple at Mt. Pyre saying such...\c\nThe Blue Orb is capable of releasing Kyogre’s\nfull power, of reverting it to its primal form.\c\nWhile the Red Orb has the power to quell that\nflood of power.
Yes. The energy overflowing from\nthe Cave of Origin just now...\c\nIt is the very energy that gives\nKyogre its power.\c\nWith the Red Orb, which contains\nthe power to suppress that,\r\nit should be possible to calm the\r\nforce of this great flood.
Of course the Red Orb’s power alone\nwill not lead you to where Kyogre waits.\r\nYou will not reach Hoenn’s Core that way.
[VAR TRNAME(0000)]...\nTo think that you had the Red Orb...
[VAR TRNAME(0000)]...\nTo think that you had the Red Orb...
You’ll be OK.\c\nYou and your Pokémon can\nhandle it, whatever happens.
I believe that.
No man or woman from Sootopolis is\npermitted to enter the Cave of Origin.
But you must go.\nTogether with your Red Orb.
You must go regardless of what\nawaits you inside that cave...
We will also work to mobilize our team members\nand offer help to the people and Pokémon who\r\nare suffering most due to this disaster.\c\nNow is the time when we all must simply do the\nbest that we can within our own chosen roles...\c\nAnd you, child...
...\n...\r\nSorry.
[VAR TRNAME(0000)]!
[VAR TRNAME(0000)]!
I heard on the news that things were going haywire\naround Sootopolis.\c\nAnd then I saw you on BuzzNav, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\c\nI couldn’t just sit there and do nothing when I knew\nyou were here in the thick of it, so I came flying!
When I saw the news about Sootopolis on my\nBuzzNav, and there you were, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]...\r\nWell, anyway, all I could think of was coming to help!\c\nYou don’t know how glad I am to see that you’re\nstill in one piece.
Bwuh?!\nIsn’t that Team Aqua? And Team Magma?!\c\nOK, can I just say that I am, like, shocked\nand confused on so many levels right now?
Bwuh?!\nIs that Team Aqua? And Team Magma?!\c\nOK, I don’t really know what to say\nright now—I’m kind of dumbfounded.
This is probably something way bigger\nthan I can even imagine, isn’t it?\c\nSo I’m not even going to ask right now.
Look, I get that this is probably something\nway bigger than I’ve ever imagined.\c\nSo, I won’t bother with any questions now.
I’m going to try to find what I can do to help,\nand then I’m going to do my best with that.\c\nAnd I’m going to keep on hoping and believing\nthat y-you’ll be OK out there, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].

I am sorry to say that we have put the\ngreatest burden on your shoulders alone...\r\nBut I trust you to take care of this.
I’m begging, so...\c\nSave us... The world...\nAnd Kyogre...
If only I had an Aqua Suit, I could follow\nKyogre all the way to the bottom of the sea!\r\nIt’s all up to you now!
I’m going to try to find what I can do to help,\nand then I’m going to do my best with that.\c\nAnd I’m going to keep on hoping and believing\nthat you’ll be OK out there, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].\c\nPlease...give it everything you’ve got!
I’m gonna find out what I should do to help,\nand then I’m going to do whatever I can.\c\nYou’d better go do the same, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].\c\nAnd I’ll always be right there behind you.\c\nA-after all...we’re friends, right?
[VAR TRNAME(0000)]!!!
[VAR TRNAME(0000)]!
It’s really over, isn’t it...
So it’s all over...
[VAR TRNAME(0000)], we owe you great thanks.
[VAR TRNAME(0000)], we owe you great thanks.
Look above you.\c\nThe sky over Sootopolis\nhas returned to normal.
The power, which had been pooling\nwithin the Cave of Origin, is now\r\nflowing back out into the world...
...\c\nIt’s...so warm...
Just now my heart felt like it was about\nto be crushed by uncertainty and terror,\r\nbut now it feels like it’s been softly set at ease...
...\c\nThe land...or the sea...\c\nHumans...or Pokémon...\c\nWhen we sought to bring\nhappiness to only one...\r\nwe nearly destroyed both.
...Yeah.\nYou’re right.
Maxie...\c\nWhat you’re saying is\nonly natural. I know that.\c\nBut still...
I can’t just change...\c\nThe world I believed to be ideal...\c\nThe kind of world that I dreamed of\nmaking, where I could live alongside\r\nmy beloved Pokémon...\c\nThat hasn’t changed.\c\nI know I’ve got nothing to stand on,\nafter causing this much hurt, but...
That’s right.\c\nYou caused a big fuss there when\nyou almost brought about the downfall\r\nof the world, you big dolt!\c\nNo matter how much you beg,\nno one can forgive that!
But...\nDo you really need their forgiveness, though?\c\nEven if you are a big dolt who no one\nin the world will ever forgive...
Shelly...
Sorry...and thanks.
Hmph...\c\nWe adults have a duty to pass this\nworld along to the next generation.\c\nA world worth passing along.\c\nWhat is it we truly need to do to\ncreate such a world?\c\nTake each other’s hand in friendship?\nOr fight for the right of supremacy?\c\nI think it is time we consider this\nagain with our team members and\r\nbreak down the wall between us.
All right, ya little scamp.\nYou managed to use that Red Orb,\r\nso now let’s see you try this on for size.\c\nIf you give it to Kyogre, you should be\nable to control its Primal Reversion.
Farewell.
See ya...

Diving in the sea. Climbing up and\ndown stairs all the time...\c\nIf you live in this town, you end up\ngetting physically fit.
I’ve never been out of this city.\c\nI wonder what the world is like on the\nother side of this round sky...
[~ 3]
Sootopolis is a city located in the center\nof a crater created by a big fallen meteoroid.\c\nIf you look up at the sky, the lip of\nthe crater is also visible.\r\nSo all you see is a circle of sky.\c\nBut that’s what makes the sky above\nSootopolis the most beautiful.
[VAR TRNAME(0000)]!

Ah, yes.\c\nYou need to hear what\nmy friend has to say.
My name is Wallace.\nI’m this town’s Gym Leader.\c\nI’ve also been entrusted with the\nprotection of the Cave of Origin.
This drought is being caused by a power\nemanating from the Cave of Origin.
This downpour is being caused by a power\nemanating from the Cave of Origin.

This sunlight...\c\nPeople and Pokémon need\nsunlight to live...\c\nSo why does this sunlight fill\nus with so much dread?
This rain...\c\nPeople and Pokémon need\nwater to live...\c\nSo why does this rain fill us\nwith so much dread?
The blazing sun over Sootopolis\nis growing even more intense...\c\nSoon all of Hoenn will be caught\nunder its withering glare...
The rain clouds massing over\nSootopolis keep building...\c\nSoon they will extend over all\nof Hoenn...

Mossdeep has many clear days,\nand its wind patterns are stable.\c\nThat’s why it’s an ideal location\nfor launching rockets into space.

Professor Cozmo!\nIt’s... It’s a disaster!
The meteoroid’s trajectory—\nit’s suddenly changed direction!\c\nNow it’s on a collision course\nwith our planet!
WHAT?\nRecheck the data!\c\nUpdate the course calculations\nand confirm the new trajectory!
Target locked on!\c\nConfirming the meteoroid’s\nnew expected trajectory now...
According to the numbers, it should make impact...\c\nSomewhere southwest of Sootopolis, on a small island\noff Route 131!
But changing trajectories midflight...\c\nIt’s almost like it’s alive.
But Professor, what should we do?\nWHAT DO WE DO?!
Calm yourself, man!
Y-y-yessir...
...Hmmn.\c\nSo it’s come to this.
Professor Cozmo.\nIf I may interrupt you...
Ah, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\nThank you for coming!\c\nAnd you brought the Meteorite\nShard with you. Well done!
Oh! [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\nThank you for coming!\c\nAnd you brought the Meteorite\nShard with you. Well done!
I was rather surprised to learn\nthat you knew the professor.\c\nYou really do seem to make\nconnections everywhere you go.
Now then, Professor...\c\nCould I ask you to explain once\nmore about the current plan?
Indeed...\nPlease come this way.
I imagine that you’ve heard some of the\nsituation from President Stone already.\c\nOur current plan involves using the\nInfinity Energy within our rocket,\r\ncombined with the life energy of humans\r\nfound in Key Stones...\c\nWe will start off by artificially replicating\nthe massive energy that is triggered at\r\nthe time of Mega Evolution!
We will fire the energy produced from\nour rocket into space...
As a matter of fact, this technology already\nexists and has been incorporated in some\r\nof our commonly used devices.
An audacious plan...\nAnd using such technology you would...\c\nMay I ask where exactly the asteroid will be warped to?
Well.\nWe’re not entirely sure, but...\c\nWe do have a device that links the warp holes.\nWe’ve named it the Link Cable.
But there’s no need to worry.\c\nBased on our theory, we can at\nleast guarantee that we will be\r\nsending it away from our planet.\c\nHowever, we’ve realized that\nwe will need more energy than\r\noriginally anticipated to control\r\nthe Link Cable properly...\c\nI’m sorry to ask this of you, but\nwith one more Meteorite Shard...
Nice!\c\nSo this is the heart of the famous\nSpace Center everyone talks about!\c\nPretty impressive, huh, Aster?
Mur mur mur!
Excuse me! Young lady!\nYou can’t just let yourself in here!
Oh? Where’s the harm in it?\nDon’t be such a stick-in-the-mud! ♪

Oh, I seeeeee...\c\nSo this is what has come of human technology\nand of hope and blood and sweat and tears and...\c\nWell, the list gets kinda long and boring.\nBut it contains everything, huh?
I know all about it.\c\nAbout just what kinda energy you’re\nusing to fuel this rocket thing...\c\nThe abominable technology humanity\nfirst thought up 3,000 years ago...
So you’re once again planning to\nclaim that this is best for humanity,\r\nor best for the whole darn world...\c\nIt’s a snap of your fingers to\nrepeat the sins of the past.\c\nWorse, if what I overheard is true...\c\nThis time, you’re about to commit\nan error more abominable than before!
Tell me, would you rather we sit here wringing\nour hands, waiting for that meteoroid to strike us?
Ahahahaha! What’s up with that?\c\nYou’re a pretty simple guy for a former\nPokémon League Champion.
Then I guess I’ll hang my hopes on what\nour current Champion will have to say.
So how about it, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]?
So how about it, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]?

Oooh! Really?\nWell, that’s promising...\c\nYou’ll have to tell me so we can set these guys straight.
Really? Too bad.\c\nGuess I was expecting more than I should have from you.\c\nHey, that’s fine, though.\nThat’s pretty normal.
Look, I’m not here to criticize the way you guys are\nlooking at this.\c\nBut I want to be sure you’ve thought this through well\nand good.\c\nYou know, there are necessary sacrifices, and there are\nunnecessary sacrifices.\c\nWhat a disappointment!\c\nThis is the best you could do with all your knowledge\nand technology?\c\nInstead of trying to make something outta nothing,\nyou’d rather repeat the mistakes of the past, straight up?\c\nNo, you’re gonna add new mistakes on top—that really\ntakes the cake.
You guys need some imagination.

Oops!\c\nBut you were all in the middle of a conversation or\nsomething, right?\r\nSorry about that.
I guess we’ll just let ourselves out, then.
C’mon, Aster.

...\nWho was that woman?\c\nAnd the way she spoke to us...\c\nIt’s almost as if she came here for some kind\nof confirmation...
Ah, Professor, forgive me.\c\nI believe you were trying to tell us something\nbefore that woman interrupted us?
Uh... Yes...\nAh, you see...\c\nIn order to complete the warp hole, we will need\nanother Meteorite Shard, an extremely pure one...
Then should we head to Granite Cave once again?
No... The kind of Meteorite Shard we need this time\ncan only be found at Meteor Falls.
Meteor Falls!\c\nI see... Perhaps we will learn something there...
I will head to Meteor Falls at once.\c\nFollow as soon as you are ready.\c\nI feel we might discover even more than a\nMeteorite Shard there...
I think we will be able to complete\nour preparations if we can get a\r\nMeteorite Shard from Meteor Falls.\c\nYoung Steven has already set out.\nI trust you’ll follow after him...

Thank you, dear.
Now then...
That is an impressive machine.\nSnap your fingers, the asteroid vanishes,\r\nand we all live happily ever after?
Ahahahah! Indeed!\nIt’s like that former Champ said!\c\nThis thing is the best hope we have of\nsaving this planet and everything on it.
But you know...
It could also be the worst tragedy imaginable\nfor some other world and everything on it.
...What are you trying to say?
I’m not talking to you.\nYou don’t get it.
Ugh...
But you, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]...
But you, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]...
Hope for our world...\nTragedy for another...\r\nYou get it, don’t you?
I do.
I don’t.
And you come through again!\nYou never disappoint me.
I suppose not.\c\nI’m not that surprised.\nIt’s pretty normal you wouldn’t.
My people know it.\c\nFrom generation to generation, we pass along\nthe lore about the distortions in the world\r\nborne by the Mega Evolution mechanism.\c\nAnd about the existence of another world,\nwhich we have long observed to be\r\njust like this one and yet not the same...
That’s right. A Hoenn region that’s\nalmost exactly like this one we live in.\r\nFilled with Pokémon and people like us.\c\nA world where maybe the evolution of\nPokémon took a slightly different path,\r\nwhere Mega Evolution is unknown...\c\nA world where that war 3,000 years\nago...never happened.\c\nA world where the ultimate weapon was\nnever even built.\c\nAnd in that Hoenn of that world...
What would happen if one day, out\nof the blue, a meteoroid appeared?\c\nWhat would happen to the people of that\nworld, without the technology to destroy\r\nthe meteoroid or the power to warp it away?
...\c\nLooks like it’s beyond the\npower of your imagination.
Zinnia crushed the\ndimensional shifter in her hand!
What kind of fool are you!\c\nYou have no substantive proof,\nand yet you claim another world,\r\none just like our own, exists?\c\nOut of this fantasy, you—you have\ndestroyed our only hope!
What have...you done...
Farewell, brief hope...
Y-you! Do you even know—\nNow what are we to do?!
Calm down there, Prof.
It’ll be OK.\nI...\c\nWe...\c\nWe can protect this\nworld...and the other.
Who exactly is “we”?\nWhat are your intentions?
Oh yeah! Silly me...\c\nI forgot the other thing I came for.
Wha-what...
?!
Zinnia snatched the Key Stone\naway from Courtney!
Zinnia snatched the Key Stone\naway from Matt!
Wha... Errgh!
Wha... Errgh!
And that’s the Key Stone gotten...\c\nNow I’ll put it together with the\nKey Stone they’ve got in their base...

Confound it all...\c\nSo she must be making for\nTeam Magma’s hideout next...
Ah... That’s it.\c\nThat woman... That “Zinnia”...\nShe mentioned the Sky Pillar.\c\nFew can enter it—only the successors of the\nancient world, who know of what has been...\c\nThe Lorekeepers who are tasked with passing\non that knowledge to those who come after...

[VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\nI have been expecting you!
Do you remember Wallace,\nwhom you met in Sootopolis?
Is that right?\nThat is a relief.
Is that right?\nThat’s rather sad for Wallace...
The Gym Leader of Sootopolis,\nWallace, should know how to undo\r\nthe seal on the Sky Pillar’s entrance.\c\nHe is also one of the few humans to\nhave inherited such ancient lore.
I will remain here and work with the\nprofessor and his team to devise\r\na plan for what to do next.\c\nThat woman...Zinnia...\nI cannot put my faith in her.\c\nWe will think of a new way to\nstop the meteoroid on our own.
Zinnia...and the Sky Pillar...\nI will leave them in your hands.\c\nI will send a message to Wallace\nfor you, so he knows to help.\c\nYou will probably find him in the\n[VAR COLOR(0002)]Cave of Origin[VAR COLOR(0000)] in [VAR COLOR(0002)]Sootopolis[VAR COLOR(0000)].
...\nLeave me alone...
Sniffle...\nBlech... Gross...
M-Miss...Courtney...\c\nYou don’t have to act tough in front of me...
Matt...\nI’ll stay by your side...
This is no time to lose heart!\nI’ve somehow got to find a way\r\nto repair the dimensional shifter!
There’s an array of computers.\nThey look expensive.\c\nThe monitors show numbers scrolling rapidly.
The energy reading appears to be diffusing!
W-we can confirm that the meteoroid has been\ndestroyed, sir!
Puh... P-P-P-P-P-P-Professor!
The meteoroid! The meteoroid—it’s—!\nThank the powers above! It’s—!
Calm yourself, man!
Oh, who am I kidding!\nI’m so happy, I could kiss you!\c\nWe did it! We actually did it!\nWahahahaha! Success is ours!
Hahahaha...ha...\c\nHah...
Thank you, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].
Thank you, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].
Oh my goodness! Hello again!
We all wanted to thank\nyou for what you did!\c\nBecause of you, our\nworld has been saved!
Quite so. No matter how much we thank\nyou, it could not possibly suffice.\r\nWe do indeed thank you most heartily!
My assistant here will show you\nthe latest test results.
Oh, quite so! Wonderful idea.
We’ve continued studying the\nmeteoroid that threatened us,\r\nand we’ve learned something.
When you faced that falling meteoroid...\c\nDid you perhaps encounter\na certain Pokémon?
Extrapolating from the energy readings we\nobserved seems to show evidence of the\r\nMythical Pokémon that lives in space: Deoxys.
When we try to track its biological signal,\nit seems to have merged with the meteoroid\r\nat some point during its approach.\c\nWe have come to the conclusion that it\nwas purposefully aiming for Hoenn.
As for what could have drawn it to\nHoenn in company with that meteoroid...\c\nWell, we haven’t yet found a plausible\nreason to explain that aspect.
But at the very least, we do not believe\nDeoxys has come to destroy Hoenn...\r\nNor to harm this world.
What reason could Deoxys have\nto seek out the Hoenn region?\c\nWe will continue to investigate that topic.
If you learn anything new about Deoxys,\nplease let us know at your earliest convenience.
Ah, yes.\nThere is one more thing we can tell you.\c\nWe have detected the biological signals of\nDeoxys here in the Hoenn region, as well.\c\nWe were able to track it to [VAR COLOR(0002)]somewhere around[VAR COLOR(0000)]\n[VAR COLOR(0002)]Route 131[VAR COLOR(0000)], but that’s as precise as we could get.\r\nIf you’re curious, perhaps you could look into it.

And create a “warp hole.”
By creating a warp hole in the path of the\nincoming meteoroid, we hope to be able to\r\ntransport it somewhere far away from here.
I think you know what I mean.\c\nThose panels that spin you about and then\nout you come, warped to another spot.\r\nI imagine you’ve stepped on a few such?

A rocket launch demands perfection.\nNot even a 1 percent margin of error is allowed.\c\nEven if it’s 99 percent OK, the whole thing is\nuseless if 1 percent happens to be no good.\c\nDespite that, we never stop trying.\nWhy? It’s a dream that never ends.

The Hoenn region has been famous for\nits meteor showers for a long time.
Wh-wh-why?\c\nI heard on BuzzNav that\nTeam Whatsit cleaned up its act!
Some people claim that Pokémon came\nfrom space. Could it be true?
Whoooooooa!\c\n...I’m saying something that I can only say\nat a time like this.

Ah...\nYes...\c\nI suppose I should welcome you to my home.\nPlease forgive the rather sparse décor...\r\nNow, where to begin...
Let us take a moment to understand what\nis happening to our world right now.
That rumbling that shook the earth just now...\nThe eardrum-rupturing explosion we heard...\c\nThey are proof that a seal, which was long hidden\ndeep undersea, has been undone at last.
The super-ancient Pokémon that has\nbeen sealed deep beneath Route 128\r\nsince ancient times...\c\nIt slept until now in the Seafloor Cavern.\c\nThe entrance to that cavern was sealed\nby the power of a certain Pokémon,\r\nall in an effort to keep any human or\r\nPokémon from ever breaching it.\c\nBut now it appears that the scheming of\nthat terrible team has undone the seal.\c\nThere is no doubt that they intend to\nrevive the super-ancient Pokémon.\c\nAnd once they do so, it seems they hope\nto make its power their own.
[VAR TRNAME(0000)]...
[VAR TRNAME(0000)]...
If that team obtains the power of the\nsuper-ancient Pokémon, it will upset\r\nthe balance of nature in this world.\c\nA crisis unlike any other before it will\nbefall every living thing on this planet.\c\nI plan to do everything in my power\nto quell this situation. That is my duty.\c\nBut there is a limit to what I can do\nwith my power alone...\c\nThat is why I am asking for your help.\nI have great faith in your abilities.\c\nLend me your strength to help put a\nhalt to these Teams’ mad ambitions!\c\nWith you and I and our Pokémon all\nworking together, we will overcome\r\nthis disastrous turn of events.\c\nI don’t think it is out of the question.\n
I will entrust you with this.
If you use Dive, you will be\nable to dive to the ocean floor\r\nwith your Pokémon.
And take this so you can stay with your\nPokémon even in the depths of the ocean...
If you were to use [VAR COLOR(0002)]Dive[VAR COLOR(0000)] in the [VAR COLOR(0002)]correct[VAR COLOR(0000)]\n[VAR COLOR(0002)]stretch of water along Route 128[VAR COLOR(0000)]...\c\nI believe you should be able to reach\nthe entrance to the [VAR COLOR(0002)]Seafloor Cavern[VAR COLOR(0000)].
I will join you when I finish my duties.
Please do what you can to stop Team\nAqua and Team Magma until then.\c\nI am trusting you to do this for me!
[VAR TRNAME(0000)] checked the Poké Ball.\c\nIt contains the Pokémon Beldum.\c\nTake the Poké Ball?
[VAR TRNAME(0000)] obtained a Beldum.

The Gym Leaders in this city\nare a formidable duo.\c\nTheir combination attacks are,\nlike, excellent and wow!
Pokémon that live in the sea and in caves\nand things are really, really good at hiding.\c\nIf they catch even a glimpse of you, they’ll\nbe gone in an instant!\c\nAnd sometimes you really feel like you can sense\na Pokémon around, but you still won’t be able to\r\nfind it unless you can actually see it with your eyes.\c\nYou have to spot ’em first, and then sneak up slowly!\nThat’s the trick!

Can you beat it?

It can’t be helped. You’ve won...
...so take this in recognition!
[VAR TRNAME(0000)] received the Mind Badge\nfrom Liza and Tate.
The Mind Badge has the power to\nmake all Pokémon up to Level 80,\r\nincluding those you’ve received\r\nfrom other people, obey you!
It also enables Pokémon to use the HM move called Dive!
And take this, too!
Calm Mind...
...comes from relaxing your\nmind and concentrating.
Pokémon’s Sp. Atk and...
...Pokémon’s Sp. Def...
...will be heightened by this move!
It’s a perfect move for\nPsychic-type Pokémon!
Looks like the bond between you\nand your Pokémon is far stronger\r\nthan the bond we share as twins...\c\nBut you’ll go on from here\nto form even more bonds!\r\nThat’s the future I see for you!
There may be a harsh ordeal\nahead for you and your Pokémon...\c\nBut that’s all right!\nYou and your Pokémon aren’t alone!\r\nYou have each other!\c\nThat’s why we want you to face\nwhatever troubles may come your way\r\nhead-on and full of courage!
Oh, you only have...

Then we can’t battle you!

Revives are fantastic!\c\nGive one to a Pokémon that’s fainted,\nand that Pokémon will be revived.\c\nBut be careful. Revive won’t restore any\nPP that has been used up by its moves.
Max Repel can keep\nweak Pokémon away.\c\nAnd it lasts the longest\nof all the Repel sprays!
Net Balls and Dive Balls used\nto be Mossdeep’s specialties.\c\nA Net Ball is effective against\nBug-type and Water-type Pokémon.\c\nA Dive Ball works best on Pokémon\nat the bottom of the sea.
Hey, you!\nQuick question! Do you want a TM?

I got this from Steven, but I don’t\nknow what it’s good for.\c\nI think it’s called King’s Rock.\nDo you want it?
Why would you want it?\nYou’re weird.\c\nYou can keep it, but don’t\ntell Steven I gave it away.
Is it really that fun collecting\nrocks? I don’t get it.
Yeah, you think so, too! What are you\nsupposed to do with some weird rock?
Around Mossdeep, you can\nsee wild Wailmer.\c\nIt’s called, uh...\nWhat is it...\c\nWai, Wai, Wai...\c\nWailmer watching!
The island’s Space Center has been\nlaunching huge rockets.
I’d heard from my mates in Lilycove\nthat the herd of Wailmer has\r\ndisappeared.\c\nI wonder what went down over there.
Wouldn’t it be nice if this island—no, the\nwhole world—was burgeoning with nature?
All life needs water to survive, even\nthough it makes its home on the land.\c\nAnd all life, having run its course,\nbecomes soil and returns to the land.\c\nThus the waters of the sea are always\nconnected to the land.
Yes, like the very shoreline here.
A voyage on a ship is fine.\c\nBut crossing the sea with Pokémon\nusing Surf...\c\nNow that’s an exhilarating trip!\nWouldn’t you agree, youngster?
This rock has a special meaning to\nthe people at the Space Center.\c\nThey put it here as their wish for\ntheir rockets to fly safely.\c\nWhen you make a wish, what do you use?\nDo you wish upon a star?\c\nI use a wish tag to make it happen.\nThat’s what I do.
It’s a white rock.

Oh man! So cold...\nSteven, please do something.
Oh man! So hot...\nSteven, please do something.
In this horrible weather, we can’t\nenjoy Wailmer watching...
What’s up with this weather?\c\nI wonder if the rocket launch may be suspended\nfor a while because of this weather...
My friend in Lilycove told me\nthe weather there is horrible, too.\c\nWhat in the world is going on\nhere in Hoenn?
If this weather stays like this,\nall plants and flowers will be withered.\r\nI can’t accept that! Ever!
Is this weather trying to return\neverything to the sea...?
Is this weather trying to return\neverything to the land...?
I learned this from the breaking news on BuzzNav.\c\nApparently, this weather is being caused by\nsomething in the sky in Sootopolis.
I’ve kept wishing on this rock in\nthe hopes that this weather will return\r\nto normal as soon as possible.
Liza and Tate in Mossdeep Gym\nhave very mysterious powers.\c\nTheir powers are paranormal...\nLike Psychic-type Pokémon!\c\nIf you have any trouble, you\nmay want to visit the Gym.

[VAR GENDBR(0000,0201)]HShe's the real [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\c\nShake my hand!\nShake my hand!
Yaaaay!\nI’m not gonna wash my hand today!
I’m happy just being able\nto talk with you!
I’m sorry for you, but the person\nwho gets the most attention in\r\ncontests now is definitely Lisia.\c\nHer aura is something else.
Whoa! [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\nI didn’t expect to see you!\c\nLisia’s fans don’t realize how great you are!\n[VAR TRNAME(0000)], am I right?\c\nKeep showing us your Pokémon’s\ngreat performance!
The most popular contest idols now\nare Lisia and Ali!\r\nThey’re incredibly strong!\c\nYou seem to have potential, but compared to\nthem, you still have a long way to go.
Ah! You’re so popular...\nYou’re strong and very kind to your Pokémon.\r\nYou’re just perfect!\c\nI...I want to be your fan forever!
I came all the way from\nKanto to see Lissi!\c\nI wonder if they’ll ever make it\nout to my hometown.
I’ve become your fan!\c\nWhen I go back to Kanto, I’ll spread\nthe news about how great you are!\r\nSo please come to my area, too!
I have no idea if you have a natural\ntalent for performance in a contest.\c\nHowever!\nI know!\c\nI know the strongest and cutest are\nLissi and Ali!
I became your fan after I saw you\nin the contest the other day!\c\nYou seem to have gained quite\na bit of popularity, I must say.\c\nHowever! Only I should know\nyour true greatness.\r\nI want to keep it all to myself!
My girlfriend is super cute, but\nLisia is as cute as her, too!
Whoa! [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\nJust as I imagined, you’re really cool!\c\nYou’re great in a Contest Costume,\nbut you look sharp in your everyday\r\nclothes, too!\c\nOh... Don’t stare at my girlfriend too much.\nI’m worried you may steal her heart.
Whoa! [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\nSo...so cute!\c\nYou’re great in your Contest Costume, but\nyou look cute in your everyday clothes, too!\c\nI like you even more!
We’re Lissi’s fans!\c\nI always play Lissi and Ali\nwith my boyfriend.\c\nI play Lissi, and he plays Ali.
Yeeek! [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\nYou look so cool in person, too!\c\nMy boyfriend is really cool, too.\nBut a real star’s coolness is a whole\r\ndifferent level of coolness!
Yeek! [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\nYou look so cute in person, too!\c\nYou’re so cute that I’m worried that\nyou may steal my boyfriend’s heart!\r\nBut you’re so cute!
Roseli! Roseli. ♪\c\n(It looks like it’s showing off\nAltaria Ali’s picture...)
Selia! Seliaaaaaa!!\c\n(Roselia appears to be extremely excited\nto see [VAR TRNAME(0000)]...)
The person who shines the most in\nHoenn is, of course, Lisia!
Whoooa!\nThis brilliantly scintillating aura!\r\nYou must be [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\c\nI’m so glad that I believed the rumor\nthat I could meet you here!\c\nYou shine the most in Hoenn!\nThere’s no doubt about it.
Contest Spectaculars don’t interest\nme at all, but if I can be like Lisia,\r\nI may give it a try!
Wow, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\c\nI bet you have a lot of fans—is it OK for\na celebrity like you to walk around here?\c\nIf pesky fans bother you, let me know.\nI’ll protect you!
Awwwww... Lissi is too cute.\c\nI’ll quit my job and follow Lissi.
Whoa! You’re a celebrity! A star!\c\nIf such lucky encounters keep happening\nto me, I’ll quit my job and support\r\n[VAR TRNAME(0000)] in every Contest Spectacular!
Oh, my dear Lisia...\nPlease come to the Pokémon Center\r\nin my town to restore your Pokémon.\c\nI’d like to allay dear Lisia and\nAli’s fatigue...
My dearest [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\nI...I...I am a huge fan of yours!\c\nI’ve been eagerly waiting for you to\ncome to our Pokémon Center!\c\nI have always watched you in contests,\nand I always will!
You have so many fans!\n[VAR TRNAME(0000)], you’re a real star!\c\nWe, your fan-club members, will\nkeep supporting you forever.\r\nYou’re our shining star, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!
Um...
Li...\nLissi!
Hey! It really is you, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\nI saw you coming in here,\r\nso I wondered what was up!\c\nTee hee! A little get-together\nwith your fans, is it? Have fun!
Hey! It really is you, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\nI saw you coming in here,\r\nso I wondered what was up!\c\nTee hee! A little get-together\nwith your fans, is it? Have fun!

Hoo, boy... Master Rank contests,\nhere I come.\c\nThe world will know that my dearest\nPokémon is the cutest being in all\r\nexistence. The time has come!\r\nUheheheh.
You can see a whole variety of\nPokémon here.\c\nThat’s why I make this place a regular\npart of my daily stroll.

The Toughness Contest is like\nextreme, man!\c\nThose muscular appeals...\nCascading sweat... I swoon!
Day in and day out, I lavished my care\non this Pokémon.\c\nIts condition is peaking.\nToday, victory is mine!
I got a present from a girl\nwho said she was my fan!\c\nHmmm, I’ve never gotten a\npresent from a girl before.\r\nTo be honest, it made me really happy!
It’s a big machine with a speed\nindicator and a meter.

I was away awhile, so I was surprised to see\nthere is an exhibit on the second floor, too.\c\nI wish someone would paint my Pokémon\nthis pretty.
Well...this is where they display the paintings\nthat everyone has been talking about recently.\c\nI see. These new paintings are indeed\nfull of vigor and are fascinating.
Wow, is that right? The models of portraits\nhere are your Pokémon.\c\nIsn’t that just the ultimate joy for\na Trainer?
I think I saw the contest when\nthis portrait was painted!\c\nI always watch your contests, though.\nThank you for always giving me\r\nsuch a fun time!
[~ 21]
Oh, it’s you!\c\nI’m the curator here.\nDo you remember me?\c\nAs I promised, I displayed your\nPokémon’s portrait art here!\c\nYes, just as I imagined, the modern\ntouch is pretty good, too.
Thanks to you, new styles have\nbeen added to this museum.\r\nI’m happy about that.
By the way...\c\nThanks to you, we were able to\ndisplay so many portraits.\c\nLet me thank you properly.
The past, the present, and the future...\c\nI’d like to collect all kinds of marvelous\nart here in Lilycove Museum!
It looks like a place to display a portrait of a\nPokémon that performed well in a contest.
This is a portrait of [VAR PKNICK(0001)], which\nperformed well in the [VAR 01A2(0000)] Contest!

Welcome to Lilycove Museum.\c\nPlease take the time to enjoy our\ncollection of fantastic artwork\r\nfeaturing Pokémon.

I’m the curator of this museum of fine arts.\c\nWell, aren’t they all fantastic pieces of art\nwith history?\c\nHuh? The second floor?\nWell...\c\nI’ve been thinking about displaying something different—\nsomething more lively—on the second floor.
It’s a very old painting.\nThe paint is peeling here and there.
It’s an odd landscape with bizarre\nand fantastic scenery.
It’s a painting of a beautiful, smiling\nwoman with a Pokémon on her lap.
It’s a painting of a Legendary Pokémon from long ago.\nThe artist painted this from their imagination.
It’s a painting of Grass-type Pokémon in a breeze.\nThey appear to be enjoying the wind’s gentle caress.
It’s a delicious-looking painting of Berries.\nThis painting could make you hungry!
It’s a famous glass sculpture.\nIt depicts an ancient bird Pokémon.
It’s a big Poké Ball carved from a black stone.\nIt was apparently used in festivals in the olden days.
It’s a huge stone tablet inscribed\nwith Pokémon and dense text in the\r\nsmall characters of an ancient,\r\nunreadable language.
Hmmm...\nWhat works of great magnificence...
Battling with Pokémon is fun,\nI’ll grant you that.\c\nBut one mustn’t forget our love for\nthe fine arts.
At this art museum...well, you can\nsee many fantastic paintings.\c\nAnd the curator is a wonderful person.\c\nAmong artists like myself, this museum\nis an inspiration.
This lady is pretty!\nShe’s like Mommy!
This Pokémon is adorable!\nJust like our little boy!
I’d heard that this art museum got\na new painting.\c\nSo naturally I hurried over.\c\nIs the new painting up on the\nsecond floor?
Lately, the curator has been\nunusually cheerful.\c\nI bet something good happened for him.\nDefinitely.
I aim to see many great paintings\nhere and learn from them.\c\nI have this dream of one day having\nmy artwork exhibited here.
The art museum has become a favorite\ntourist destination.\c\nIt’s great for Lilycove...\nNo, great for the Hoenn region!\c\nThis is what I’ve heard—a lone Trainer is\nresponsible for all the paintings upstairs.
I asked this museum to display\nmy art, but they turned me down!\c\nWhat kind of museum doesn’t\nappreciate my art? Yeesh.\c\nAnyway, how about you?\nAre you interested in my art?
Oh! You’re the one who appreciates my art!\c\nI know! You’re interested in buying\nanother piece of my art today, right?
Fine. We artists are lonely by nature.
Yay! I’m so glad that I finally met a\nTrainer who appreciates art!\c\nI’ll specially sell my art for $100,000\na piece to you.\c\nWhich one are you interested in?
Paradoxical Popper
Meditative Seat
Heterarchical Loop
Not interested...
A Paradoxical Popper!\c\nThere’s no point in just selling it.\nLet me talk about my thought behind this art first.\c\n...\nYou suddenly feel empty!\c\nYou wonder if you’re worthy in this world.\c\nYou worry that you may be forgotten without\nproducing anything.\c\nYou feel living may be meaningless!\c\nBut you still live!\c\nFinally, you’ll discover the limitless possibilities in\nyourself and in the life you thought was empty!\c\nThis art represents that!\nI’ll sell this to you for $100,000.\r\nWill you buy it?
A Meditative Seat!\c\nThere’s no point in just selling it.\nLet me talk about my thought behind this art first.\c\n...\nWhat you are looking at now?\c\nDoes it really exist?\c\nAll may not exist!\c\nWhen you realize that!\c\nYour world will lose its light!\c\nAnd what you’ll have is a void without light...\c\nBut because of that, you feel it!\c\nYou feel something with substance!\c\nYou feel a powerful life!\c\nThis art represents that!\nI’ll sell this to you for $100,000.\r\nWill you buy it?
A Heterarchical Loop!\c\nThere’s no point in just selling it.\nLet me talk about my thought behind this art first.\c\n...\nDo you have a bright future?\c\nYour next step...\c\nWill it really create your future as you wish?\c\nYou get frightened!\c\nYou may not escape from this chaos ever again!\c\nBut no matter what kind of future awaits, you still\nnervously take a step wondering what kind of\r\nfuture unfolds!\c\nThis art represents that!\nI’ll sell this to you for $100,000.\r\nWill you buy it?
I’m thrilled!\c\nThank you!\nPlease display it.
You don’t have enough money.\c\nI can’t lower the price once\nI set it for my art. Sorry.
You’ve already bought enough of them!\nQuantity is not always better when it comes to art.
There are pamphlets that read “Welcome to\nLilycove Museum” on the rack.
It’s an old-style picture of a\npopular Trainer of the past.
It’s a sculpture depicting Shroomish.\nIt’s created by an up-and-coming artist.

All of us GAME FREAK staff came\nhere for a little company getaway.\c\nThe sea breeze really tickles my heart.\nIt feels just wonderful here!
No matter how you look at it, it has got to be a safe!
It’s a hanging scroll with the art\nof a famous calligrapher on it!\c\nYou can’t even begin to guess\nwhat it’s supposed to say!

Hm, so they doubled the guests by\nusing Pokémon as attractions?\c\nHm, well, maybe I should make a cute\nPokémon our motel’s mascot.\c\nI wonder if that will attract more\nguests to stay with us.
Oh, sorry, sorry!\nI was so absorbed in watching TV!\c\nSince that Team Aqua came to town,\nthe tourists have been staying away.
Oh, sorry, sorry!\nI was so absorbed in watching TV!\c\nSince that Team Magma came to town,\nthe tourists have been staying away.
Hey, down in front!\nI can’t see the TV!
Amazing! A Pokémon\nfound someone’s lost item!\c\nThat’s cool. If we had some\nsmart Pokémon like that,\r\nwe could recover anything\r\nmislaid by our guests.
Oh, sorry, sorry!\nI was so absorbed in watching TV!\c\nI heard that someone busted the\nTeam Aqua Hideout.\c\nThanks to that, a big group made a\nreservation with us.\c\nIt was a company called...uh...\nGAME something...

Amazing! A house-sitting Pokémon\ncaught a burglar?\c\nThat’s something. If we had a tough\nPokémon as a security guard...\c\nWe would be able to provide our guests\nwith greater safety.
Oh, sorry, sorry!\nI was so absorbed in watching TV.\c\nOh, yes. A big group of guests arrived\na little while ago.\c\nThey made a reservation as GAME FREAK,\nso I guess they must make games.\c\nUh-oh, I’d better get working on\ntheir dinner!
Hey, hey!\nDon’t go in there. That’s our kitchen!
Whoa! What a surprise!\c\nI didn’t know a Pokémon was here.\nFood has been disappearing lately,\r\nso I thought something was going on.\c\nThis Pokémon shouldn’t be living\nhere without my permission.\c\nHarrumph!\c\nBut, taking a closer look, this Pokémon\nseems cute, smart, and tough...\c\nHey, you. Do you want to be our Pokémon?\nWe provide three square meals a day.
Kec! Kecleeee!
I see!\nYou want to be our Pokémon!\c\nI hope you’ll do a great job as\nour mascot Pokémon!\c\nThe fate of our motel depends\non you!
Kec! Keclecleee!
Amazing! A house-sitting Pokémon\ncaught a burglar?\c\nThat’s something. If we had a tough\nPokémon as a security guard...\c\nPerhaps, we should start training our\nPokémon to be able to provide our\r\nguests with greater security.

There’s an invisible obstacle in your way.
Would you like to use the Devon Scope?
[VAR TRNAME(0000)] slipped the Devon Scope on.
A previously invisible Pokémon became visible to\nthe naked eye!
There are a lot of souvenir goods\nunique to Cove Lily in Lilycove.

I wonder how many kinds of Pokémon\nthere are in the world.\c\nI’ll trade Pokémon with people in faraway places via\nthe PSS, so someday I can collect all the Pokémon!
I’ve been hearing about some rotten scoundrels who are\nnabbing people’s Pokémon. I hear one even stole\r\na Meteorite!
Those rotten scoundrels who were stealing\npeople’s Pokémon and Meteorites...\c\nI don’t think I’ve seen them around lately.
Aha! Pokémon Journal\c\nJust like Poison-type Pokémon being immune to poison,\nGhost-type Pokémon can flee regardless of Mean Look\r\nand Shadow Tag.

Heeey! [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!
Don’t tell me...\nAre you here for the shopping, too, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]?
We’re right in front of the famous\nLilycove Department Store, after all!
When I saw you, I figured maybe you’d come\nhere to do some shopping, same as me.
I’m afraid I already bought up tons of stuff!\nLike Pokémon Dolls...and posters...and...
B-but—\c\nThat’s not all I’ve been doing, of course!\c\nI’ve also caught tons of different Pokémon,\nand I’ve been raising them well, too!
Really?
Hm...
Gasp!\nYou doubt me?! Harsh!
Aughhh! You think I’m lying, don’t you!\nThat little hum totally said you think I’m lying!
I think the bigger question here is whether\nyou’re raising your Pokémon right, not me!
S-so that settles it!\nLet’s have a battle!
Let’s test my team and see how they stack up\nagainst your passion for Pokémon, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!
[~ 13]
Ahhh, this reminds me of the battle\nI had with you back on Route 103!
You were able to become this strong because\nyou battled me back then, right, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]?
...What would you think if I said something like that?
Hee hee...
I’m actually thinking that it’s about time I went\nback to Littleroot, though.
I’ve caught a lot of different Pokémon, and my Pokédex\nis pretty complete, so I think I should go show\r\nit to my dad.
...Huh?\nDid something just...sparkle in your Bag?\c\nIt was like the light from that Meteorite...
...Oh, nothing! Sorry! Just forget it!\c\nI’m probably just imagining things!
[VAR TRNAME(0000)], what are you going to do?\c\nYou going to collect all the Gym Badges and\ntake on the Pokémon League challenge?
Typical [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\c\nThen while you’re collecting your Badges,\nI guess I’ll go and complete my Pokédex!
What, really?\nWell, now you’ve got me curious!\c\nIf you aren’t focusing on the League,\nthen what else are hoping to achieve?\r\nI can’t wait to see what you’ll do!
I guess I’ll be off, then!
But let’s definitely meet\nup again somewhere!
Hm?
Hey, if it isn’t [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\nDid you come to do some shopping, too?
[~ 29]
You know what I’m talking about...\nThe Lilycove Department Store!\c\nMy dad asked me to pick\nhim up a few things here.
It’s not like I’m here to buy\nDolls or something, r-right!
A-anyway, it feels like it’s been ages\nsince we last ran into each other.
How about I battle you so you can see which one\nof us is doing a better job raising our Pokémon?
Though I think you and I both know who the\nwinner is gonna be, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!
Boy, that stings a bit...\c\nI had a head start on you as\na Pokémon Trainer, but still...
I, uh...\c\nI’m planning on going\nhome to Littleroot.
You know how I’ve been helping out my dad with the\nPokédex, and it’s been coming together pretty decently.\r\nSo...I ought to go back home and show it to him.
[VAR TRNAME(0000)], what are you gonna do?\c\nYou still thinking of collecting all the Gym Badges\nand taking on the Pokémon League challenge?
Yeah? I guess I’m not surprised.\nDo your best. You know I’m behind you.\c\n...Uhhh. Huh? Did you...\n[VAR TRNAME(0000)], I think there’s something...\c\nThere’s something, like, sparkling in your Bag...\c\nIt’s the same kinda light as that Meteorite had,\nthe one you showed me in Lavaridge...
Huh? Really?\nI’ve gotta say, I always kind of thought that\r\nyou’d go all the way and aim to be Champion.\c\n...Uhhh. Huh? Did you...\n[VAR TRNAME(0000)], I think there’s something...\r\nThere’s something, like, sparkling in your Bag...\c\nIt’s the same kinda light as that Meteorite had,\nthe one you showed me in Lavaridge...
Ahhh, never mind!\c\nJust... Good luck out there!
Muahahaha!\c\nWe moved more loot into our secret hideout today...
Wh-who are you?!\nI was just talking to myself!
I’m just a Grunt, so I have no idea what the Boss\nis thinking...\r\nThat’s OK with me, though!\c\nIf I just stay on Team Aqua, someday I’ll be able to do\nsomething awesome!\r\nSomeday I’ll be big time!
Wh-who are you?!\nI was just talking to myself!
Hey, you!\c\nDon’t go near the cave in the cove!\c\nWhy? You don’t need a reason why!\nI’m an adult, so you just listen to me!
If this whole wide world becomes ours, Team Aqua’s,\nthen the 101 Skitty at my parents’ house and\r\nthe Wailmer that live with me should be happier, too!
There, Wailmer! Now leap out of the water and turn!
Huh? What do you want?\c\nYou’re messing up our training, so can you, like, get lost?
Fufufu...\c\nWe’ve finished moving more loot into our\nsecret hideout today.
Wh-who are you?!\nI was just talking to myself!
I have no idea what the Boss is thinking...\nI’m still here, though.\c\nTo me, being here with Team Magma is the only chance\nI have to make a real connection with someone...
Wh-who are you?!\c\nDon’t stand there without my permission listening\nto me talk to myself!
Hey, you!\c\nDon’t go near the cave in the cove!\c\nWhy? You don’t need a reason why!\nI’m an adult, so you just listen to me!
If this whole wide world becomes ours, Team Magma’s,\neverybody back home in the country,\r\nmy Ma and Pa, my little sisters and brothers,\r\ncousins and second cousins...\c\nI’m sure everyone will be happier!
There, Wailmer!\nNow leap out of the water!
Wh-who are you?!\c\nYou’re getting in the way\nof my training, so get lost!
A great variety of Pokémon have gathered\nto show off how cute or tough they\r\nare in the Contest Spectacular!\c\nMe, I love a great variety of Pokémon, so\nmy heart is pounding with anticipation!
Have you seen that strange cave in\nthe cove at the edge of town?
I’m going to teach my Pokémon some new\nmoves for the Contest Spectacular!\c\nThat’s why I’m headed to the Move Deleter\nto make my Pokémon forget HM moves.
The Hoenn region shines with the beauty\nof its waterways and verdant nature.\c\nIt makes me realize that it’s just as lovely\na place as my home in the Kanto region!
Team Magma’s been training\ntheir Wailmer in the cove.\c\nWe sailors can’t get our boats\nout to sea with them in the way!

I expected nothing less from you!\c\nYour Altaria looks pretty amazing, too, doesn’t it?\nYou can make it, can’t you?
Yeah, yeah, hang in there!
Too bad! A miss!
It’s so hot...
It’s so cold...
This may not be the time for the Contest Spectacular,\nbut it’s at times like these that we\r\nshould do our best to enjoy our time.
According to breaking news on BuzzNav,\nthis aberrant weather is only having an\r\neffect on Sootopolis and surrounding areas...\c\nAt least for the time being...
When the weather’s as out of hand as this,\nthere’s no way I can go out to sea.
I’ll refrain from letting my Pokémon\nplay outdoors for a while...\c\nI wouldn’t want my Pokémon to come\ndown with something—nor me, either!
I am a painter.\c\nTo have the luck to encounter aberrant\nweather such as this in my lifetime...\c\nWith this extraordinary world before my eyes,\nmy creative juices are really flowing!
This weather...\c\nFacing adversity like this\nmakes my blood boil...\c\nHoney?\nFuhoho fuhohoho...
When my husband proposed to me\nhere on this spot 60 years ago,\r\nthe weather was just like this...\c\nMufufu mufufufu...

Hey now! I won’t let you go any farther down\nthis beach!\r\nAfter all, our hideout’s down there!\r\nWheeze, wheeze!
Hey now! I won’t let you go any farther down\nthis beach!\r\nI mean, our hideout’s down there!\r\nCough, cough!

Decorations you buy here are sent to\nthe PC exclusively for your Secret Base.\c\nHow great is that! Would be even greater\nif they could deliver me home, too!
I’m buying a pretty desk, and I’m going\nto put it in my Secret Base!\c\nAnd I’m going to put a lot of Azurill Dolls\non my desk and on the floor!
Yo-o-o-o, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\nI knew we’d meet again!
What? You don’t know where you are?\c\nThis is the [VAR COLOR(0002)]Secret Base Guild[VAR COLOR(0000)], of course!\c\nHuh?\nWhaddaya mean you never asked?\r\nOh, you! No need to be shy, my [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0403)]boygirl!\c\nThe Secret Base Guild is here to fully\nsupport everyone so they can have a\r\nSecret Base life full of adventure!
We can give you hints on how to enjoy your\nbase, and items you can’t get anywhere else!\c\nAnd, best of all, coming here means that you\ncan always meet me! Anytime you want!
Y’know, [VAR TRNAME(0000)], that reminds me...\c\nYou still haven’t made yourself\na [VAR COLOR(0002)]team[VAR COLOR(0000)], have you?\c\nSee, a team is made up of, like, the pals\nthat hang out in your base with you.\c\nI guess you could just call ’em friends,\nbut doesn’t “team” sound cooler?\c\nWhen you meet people in other bases,\nyou can ask ’em to join your team!\c\nNothing wrong with playing alone, course,\nbut having some pals around sure can\r\nliven things up in your base!\c\nIf you haven’t tried it yet, I think you oughta\ngive it a shot before you write it off!
Mm-hmmm! I get it.\nSo you made yourself a team, huh?\r\nTeam [VAR 01AA(0001)]!\c\nYeah, it sounds like it’s full of adventure!\nNot a bad name at all!
Oh yeah! You’ve been collecting flags, little pal?\c\nHere at the Secret Base Guild, we assign\nranks to all the teams based on how many\r\nflags they’ve managed to get, see.\c\nThe more Secret Bases you find and the\nmore flags you snag, the higher you and\r\nyour team will end up in the ranking!
Huh? You wanna know why we do that?\nAin’t it obvious? It’s more fun that way!\r\nA bit of rivalry gets everybody fired up!\c\nAnd doesn’t it seem full of adventure to\nbe on an endless hunt for more flags?\c\nThe higher your rank gets, the richer your\nbase life will become. You’ll see!\c\nSo go out there and find those flags,\nand then bring ’em here to show me!
So lemme give a gift to my fellow base fanatic,\nfor coming so far to see me here!
A [VAR COLOR(0002)]Proclamation[VAR COLOR(0000)] will let you set the battle\nformat that will fly in your own base.\c\nThere are lots of Decorations with special\nand cool effects like that!\c\nWhenever you get a new bit of swag for\nyour digs, check it out to see what it does!\c\nAnd enjoy the base life!
Hi! Do people tell you that you look like\n[VAR iCOLOR2(0000)][VAR 010E(0000)]?
Oh...\nThen what do you think you look like?
I knew it!\nI just knew it!

This is a little present for Team [VAR 01A9(0003)]!
Hrmmm. I’ve gotta capture this\nsuper moment forever somehow...
That’s it!\c\nSo you’ll never forget the thrill of\nadventure when you reached [VAR 01AA(0003)]...\c\nHow ’bout we take a picture of\nTeam [VAR 01AA(0001)] right now?\c\nThat’s it! I’m a genius!
Now that it’s decided, I can’t wait another moment!\nYou’d better get ready, too, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!
All right! Everybody’s here, yeah?\nThen here we go...\c\nSay cheese!
[VAR 01AA(0007)]!
And it’s...perfect!\nMan, what a great shot!
Man, I’m gonna keep this photo in\nthe album in my heart forever!\c\n...You and your teammates sure are\nsuper, you know?\c\nA super team...\nThe Super Team [VAR 01AA(0001)]!\r\nThat’s what we oughta call you!\c\nYou keep having a blast with your\nSecret Base out there, pal!
OK, lemme see here...\c\nTeam [VAR 01AA(0001)]’s flag collection\nis now all the way up to...\r\nThat’s [VAR NUM6(0002,002C)]!\c\nAnd you need [VAR NUM6(0004,002C)] flags to move up\nto the [VAR 01A9(0003)]!\c\n...

And I’ve got a gift for the\nbest-ever team, too!
And I’ll give you this fella, too!\nIt doesn’t do a thing for me and\r\nmy loyal Flygon here...\c\nBut you get the adventure of battle,\nso I figure you oughta be up for it!
There’s nothing left I can even say!\nYou are a Secret Base master!\c\nI just hope you’ll keep showing others\nthe adventure that awaits in base life!\c\nI’ll always be here, of course, so\nfeel free to stop by anytime!
Looks like you haven’t made\na team for yourself yet.\c\nTry getting some pals together!\nThat’s the first step!

Heheh, I asked my Wingull to run an\nerrand for me.
Good!\nWelcome back, Wingull!
Huh? What is this?\nWhat is it holding?
A Mental Herb?\nIt must have picked it up somewhere.

Hidden Power varies in type depending\non the Pokémon using it.
No, too bad.\nYou guessed wrong.

Oh, OK. If you change your mind,\nplease come see me.\c\nI’ll be waiting!
Thank you for trading with me!\c\nI really wanted this Pokémon, so\nI promise to take good care of it!

I recognize your talent and present you with\nthis Gym Badge.
[VAR TRNAME(0000)] received the Feather Badge\nfrom Winona.
With the Feather Badge, all Pokémon up to Lv. 70,\neven those received through trades, will obey your\r\nevery command.\c\nYou will also be able to use the HM move Fly\noutside of battle.
And this...\nThis is a gift from me.
Roost...\c\nWith this move, the user can restore its HP by up to\nhalf of its max HP by landing on the ground and\r\nresting its injured body.\c\nHowever, the user loses its Flying-type designation\nduring the turn, so be cautious.
You won against me...\nI know you’ll keep aiming higher and higher!\c\nSomeday, you may even fly up into the sky...\nThat’s the impression I get from you.

I have my pride-and-joy Pokémon\nwith me. This time, I’ll beat Winona.
The ground absorbs rainwater, and\ntrees grow by drinking that water...\c\nOur Fortree City exists thanks to\nour having both earth and water.
This city’s homes are built on trees.\c\nPerhaps because of that lifestyle,\neveryone seems healthy and lively.\c\nWhy, even I do! I feel as if I’ve grown\n30 years younger since I moved here.
Living on top of trees is fine.\c\nBut sometimes Bug Pokémon\ncome in through the windows.\r\nIt can cause quite the fright!
Some Pokémon evolve when\nyou Link Trade them with friends.
There’s an invisible obstacle in your way.
Would you like to use the Devon Scope?
[VAR TRNAME(0000)] slipped the Devon Scope on.
A previously invisible Kecleon became visible to\nthe naked eye!
The startled Kecleon fled!

Any Pokémon that’s learned Cut can\nchop down prickly trees if the Trainer\r\nhas earned the Stone Badge.\c\nHMs like this can be used outside\nof battle, too, with the right Badges!

Do you nickname your Pokémon?\nI gave a cool name to mine.\c\nBut when I call my Pokémon by that\nname, people laugh at me...\c\nIf it’s OK with you, want to trade\nyour [VAR PKNAME(0002)] for my [VAR PKNAME(0001)]?
Hee hee hee, ooh, this is so exciting!
But that’s no [VAR PKNAME(0002)].\nTsk. So disappointing.
Aww, it’s a good Pokémon...
Don’t you get curious about what other\npeople named their Pokémon?
Ah! You only have one Pokémon.\nSorry, I can’t trade with you.
In all sorts of places, there are all\nsorts of Pokémon and people.\c\nI find that fascinating! It inspires\nme to go to all sorts of places.

But giving the name “Pekachu”\nto a Shroomish doesn’t seem right...\c\nAlthough I do understand the importance of\ngiving a familiar nickname to your Pokémon.

The blackboard lists status changes\nthat may affect Pokémon in battle.
Which topic do you want to read about?
Poisoned
Paralysis
Sleep
Burned
Frozen
Cancel
If a Pokémon is poisoned, it will steadily lose HP.\nThe poison won’t disappear after the battle, either.\c\nHeal the condition using an Antidote.
Paralysis reduces the Speed stat of a Pokémon\nand may prevent it from making any moves.\c\nParalysis also lingers after battle, so use a\nParalyze Heal to free your Pokémon from it.
If a Pokémon falls asleep, it will be unable to\nattack as long as it is sleeping.\c\nThe Pokémon may wake up on its own, but if the\nbattle ends while it is sleeping, it will stay asleep.\c\nYou can wake it up using an Awakening.
A burn reduces a Pokémon’s Attack stat and\nsteadily reduces its HP. It will remain after battle.\c\nYou can cure a burn using a Burn Heal.
If a Pokémon is frozen, it becomes\ncompletely helpless.\c\nIt will remain frozen after battle.\nThaw it out using an Ice Heal.
Students who don’t study get a little\ntaste of my Quick Claw, you see.\c\nWhether or not you are a good student\nwill be evident from the way you use\r\nthis item.
A Pokémon holding the Quick Claw will\noccasionally speed up and get to move\r\nbefore its opponent, you see.\c\nThere are many other items that are\nmeant to be held by Pokémon.\c\nJust those alone will give you many\ntopics to study!
I’m trading Pokémon with my friend\nright now.
I always wanted a Seedot, and\nI’m finally getting one!
Pokémon can hold items, but they\ndon’t know what to do with man-made\r\nitems like Potions and Antidotes.
You know how some Pokémon moves\ncan confuse a Pokémon?\c\nA confused Pokémon will sometimes\nattack itself without meaning to.\c\nBut once it leaves battle,\nit will return to normal.
A Pokémon holding a Berry will\nheal itself...\c\nThere are many kinds of items that\nPokémon can hold...\c\nBoy, it sure is hard taking all\nthese notes...
It’s this student’s notebook...\c\nPokémon are to be caught using Poké Balls.\nUp to six Pokémon can accompany a Trainer.\c\nA Trainer is someone who catches Pokémon, raises them,\nand battles with them.\c\nA Trainer’s mission is to defeat the strong Trainers and\nGym Leaders who await challengers in Pokémon Gyms.
Hey. I’m not a weird man.\nI’m the head of this school.\c\nTo prove that, I’ll share some\nknowledge with you.
I’ll explain about various Badges\nyou can get in the Hoenn region!
I feel a bit bored and lonely.\c\nIf you want to know about them,\nplease come back!
If you have a Stone Badge, Pokémon up to\nLv. 20 will obey your every command.
If you have a Knuckle Badge, Pokémon up to\nLv. 30 will obey your every command.
If you have a Dynamo Badge, Pokémon up to\nLv. 40 will obey your every command.
If you have a Heat Badge, Pokémon up to\nLv. 50 will obey your every command.
If you have a Balance Badge, Pokémon up to\nLv. 60 will obey your every command.
If you have a Feather Badge, Pokémon up to\nLv. 70 will obey your every command.
If you have a Mind Badge, Pokémon up to\nLv. 80 will obey your every command.
If you have a Rain Badge, all Pokémon\nwill obey your every command.
Which Badge do you want me to explain?
Stone Badge
Knuckle Badge
Dynamo Badge
Heat Badge
Balance Badge
Feather Badge
Mind Badge
Rain Badge

I’m Mr. Stone, the president of\nthe Devon Corporation.\c\nI heard just now how we have\nquite a bit to thank you for.\c\nSo you helped out my staff not\njust once, but twice!\c\nThere’s a favor I’d like to ask\nof a reliable Trainer like you.
Now I want you to know I’m\na president you can trust.\c\nI’d never be so mean as to ask\na favor for nothing in return.\c\nHere, give me your PokéNav\nPlus for a moment.
Mr. Stone updated your PokéNav Plus!\c\nYou can now use the BuzzNav function\non your PokéNav Plus!
The function that I just added to your\nPokéNav Plus is called BuzzNav.\c\nIt is an indispensable tool for any Trainer\nwho is traveling out in the world.\c\nUse it, and you’ll be able to get the latest\nnews from around the region and from\r\nyour own friends, anytime and anyplace.\c\nNow let me get to the important issue of\nwhat it is I need you to do...
I want to ask you to deliver this\n[VAR COLOR(0002)]Letter [VAR COLOR(0000)]to a man named [VAR COLOR(0002)]Steven[VAR COLOR(0000)].\r\nYou should find him in [VAR COLOR(0002)]Dewford[VAR COLOR(0000)].
You’ll have to cross the sea\nto reach Dewford, of course.\c\nI’ll ask [VAR COLOR(0002)]Mr. Briney[VAR COLOR(0000)], the old sailor\nwho lives in that hut on [VAR COLOR(0002)]Route 104[VAR COLOR(0000)],\r\nto help with the crossing.\c\nGo find him, and he should agree\nto help you.\c\nI’m counting on you, young [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0403)]manlady!\c\nIf you’re ever unsure of what to do,\njust come and talk with me again!
Deliver that [VAR COLOR(0002)]Letter [VAR COLOR(0000)]to [VAR COLOR(0002)]Steven[VAR COLOR(0000)]\nin [VAR COLOR(0002)]Dewford Town [VAR COLOR(0000)]for me!\c\nYou’ll have to cross the sea\nto reach Dewford, of course.\c\nI’ll ask [VAR COLOR(0002)]Mr. Briney[VAR COLOR(0000)], the old sailor\nwho lives in that hut on[VAR COLOR(0002)] Route 104[VAR COLOR(0000)],\r\nto help with the crossing.\c\nGo find him, and he should agree\nto help you.\c\nI’m counting on you, young [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0403)]manlady!

Since my youth, I’ve immersed myself in work.\c\nConsequently, I’m not very familiar with recent\ntrends and that sort of thing.\c\nDo all young people want to be Trainers and\naim for the Pokémon League, I wonder?
This is the top floor of the Devon Corporation.\c\nOur president’s office is on this floor.\c\nI can’t tell you how grateful I am for what\nyou’ve done for our company.\c\nCould you wait here for just a moment?
Our president would like to\nhave a word with you.\c\nPlease come with me.
Please, go ahead.
Mr. Briney is an old and dear\nfriend of Mr. Stone’s.\c\nThe two of them, along with\none other friend, used to\r\ntravel all the corners of the\r\nworld together in their youth.
Two of Devon’s greatest-ever products,\nwhich took the world by storm!\c\nThey are the Repeat Ball and Timer Ball!
It’s a fancy display of all the rare\nstones the president has collected.
Dad...
[VAR TRNAME(0000)] is here.
[VAR TRNAME(0000)] is here.
Well, welcome, welcome.\nIt’s been quite a while...\r\nhasn’t it?
Ho ho ho...\nI suppose I’m just getting old.\c\nRecently I seem to forget details just as soon as\nI learn them...\r\nHo ho ho ho...
...Dad?
Ahem!\c\nOh, I know.\nI know what you want to say.\r\nMy, what a hasty, impatient one you are!\c\nWhat are we to do with such an impatient\none for our Pokémon League Champion?
...Hm? Oh, is that so?\c\nSo you’re the new Champion, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]?
...Hm? Oh, is that so?\c\nSo you’re the new Champion, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]?
Then I guess we’ll never break you of that impatience\nafter all, Steven!\c\nHo ho ho ho!
Dad!
Bah!\nI know... I know...\r\nCan’t you take a joke...
Now then, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].
Now then, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].
I’m afraid that I’m planning to start in on a rather long\nand quite heavy topic.
Are you sure that you’re ready to take all of it in?
I guess so...
Not really.
Hmph. Well, if you’re not ready,\nthen I guess that’s that.\c\nWhen you do start to feel ready,\ncome to talk to me again.
Hmm...\c\nThen I suppose I should begin.\c\nLet me first take us back 3,000 years, to the days when\nthis story began...
There was a great war at that time, in a region far\nfrom here.\c\nThat war was finally brought to an end by a weapon\ncreated by one man.\c\nAnd what energy source could power such a\ndreadful weapon?\r\nDo you know?\c\nYou see...\nIt ran on the life energy of Pokémon.
The energy that could be gained by the sacrifice\nof so many Pokémon...\c\nThere are surely many people who would call\nit reprehensible.\c\nBut my grandfather, the president of Devon\nbefore me, said this...\c\n“Couldn’t we use the energy to improve\nthe lives of people and Pokémon?”\c\nAnd so he developed our greatest creation\nhere at the Devon Corporation:\r\nInfinity Energy.
Thanks to Infinity Energy, Devon was able to\nbecome one of the top industries in Hoenn\r\nand developed into the giant you see today.\c\nYou may be surprised to learn that the Devon\nParts you once recovered for us were in fact\r\nparts of a motor that would make it possible\r\nto power a submarine using Infinity Energy.
It was not long before we began to expand\nour attempts to further human development.\r\nNext, we moved into exploring space.\c\nThe rockets launched from the Mossdeep\nSpace Center using our Infinity Energy...\c\nThey are the true results of our dreams,\nour passion, and our technology.\c\nBut never did we imagine they could end\nup as the best hope for saving our world.
My preamble has been quite long, but we arrive\nat last at the real issue.\c\nThat is the overwhelming catastrophe which now\napproaches us.\c\nA huge asteroid, more than six miles in diameter,\nis currently on track to collide with our planet.
We have been working together with the\nMossdeep Space Center, which was first to\r\nrecognize this danger.\c\nWe are devising countermeasures that would\nuse our rockets, but...\c\nIn order for these plans to succeed, though,\nwe need a Meteorite Shard.
So that’s it...\c\nYou want h[VAR GENDBR(00FF,0202)]imer to go and get that shard for you.
Hah! That’s my boy, all right!\nI knew you’d understand at once.
It was hardly a deduction worthy of praise...
I want you to make your way to the [VAR COLOR(0002)]Granite Cave[VAR COLOR(0000)]\nnear Dewford.\c\nAccording to our surveys, you should be able to\nfind the kind of [VAR COLOR(0002)]Meteorite Shards[VAR COLOR(0000)] that we need there.\c\nAnd you, Steven...\c\nI want you, Son, to head for the Space Center at once\nto start the preparations, using that Link Cable that\r\nI gave you.
The Link Cable?\nSo it is to be a warp system...\r\nYes, I understand.\c\nBut Granite Cave...\c\nAh. I see. The floor where we first met—\nthe floor with the [VAR COLOR(0002)]ancient wall paintings[VAR COLOR(0000)].\c\nIt is true that there were many shards of\nmeteorite scattered about there.
It looks as though it’s decided then, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].\nI will head for the Space Center in Mossdeep.
It looks as though it’s decided then, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].\nI will head for the Space Center in Mossdeep.
If I learn anything, I will contact you at once.\c\nThough it will end up as another one-sided\nmessage like the one I sent you, I’m afraid.
Good luck.
...Steven?\nYou be careful.
Then...I will be counting on the two of you to\ntake care of this for me.\c\nIf you forget just what it is you need to do,\ncome talk to me again...\r\nAssuming I remember as well! Ho ho...
The last hope of humanity...\nIf we lose the dimensional shifter now, we will have\r\nno way to stop that asteroid from striking our planet...
The dimensional shifter was destroyed\nby one of the Draconids...?\c\nWhy...?\nWhy would the Draconid people...?
Thanks to the heroic actions of you young\npeople and your Pokémon teams...\c\nwe have been able to dispel the threat\nof the asteroid without a single loss!\c\nPerhaps I have put too much of my faith\nin technology’s promise alone.\c\nPerhaps my belief that the sacrifice of some\nmight be necessary to guarantee the safety\r\nof many— Perhaps it was wrong all along.
My father is...\c\nWell, let me just say that I have been his\nson for 25 years, and sometimes even I\r\nam not sure I understand him fully.
Hm? Ah. That Intriguing Stone you have...\c\nOn second look, it seems to be Pidgeotite,\ndoesn’t it?
To be carrying around a Mega Stone like that...\nIt looks like you’re also a bit of a connoisseur.
We had to do a whole lot of\nresearch into Mega Evolution\r\nto develop Infinity Energy.\c\nIt was all based on the legend\nof Rayquaza that the Draconid\r\npeople passed down for the\r\npast several thousand years.
What do you say?\c\nSince you did work alongside us to\nsave the world and all, I guess I could\r\ntell you about my research results...\r\nWant to hear about them?
Understood!\c\nAhem...\nTo begin...
It appears that within Rayquaza’s body resides\nan organ with the same power as a Mega Stone.\r\nI have dubbed it the mikado organ.\c\nWe believe Rayquaza usually inhabits the\nstratosphere, where its instincts prompt it to consume\r\nsmall meteoroids that fall into the atmosphere.\c\nThe meteoroids merge with Rayquaza’s internal\nenergy to create an effect similar to a Mega Stone.\c\nWe believe that, thanks to its mikado organ,\nRayquaza can undergo its own Mega Evolution,\r\nmanifesting sufficient power to repel both\r\nPrimal Groudon and Primal Kyogre.\c\nAs we can gather from legends, Rayquaza\nhas swooped in to put a stop to their clashes\r\nmany times in the long history of the world.
Those who saw the way that Rayquaza,\npossessing this special power, reacted\r\nto their Key Stones to transform itself,\r\nbegan research into the subject.\c\nIt came to be recognized as a form of\nEvolution, a new possibility for Pokémon.\c\nAnd what we stitched together from all\nof this long research is the current theory\r\nof Mega Evolution.
A part of Rayquaza’s entry in the Pokédex\nwas even edited due to this bit of folklore.
...Ahem!\c\nAnd that, while simplified quite a bit, is what\nI have deciphered from the ancient records of\r\nthe Draconid people about the relationship\r\nbetween Rayquaza and Mega Evolution.
Oh... Well, that’s a real shame.\c\nIf you ever find yourself interested,\njust come talk to me again!
Oho!\c\nTh-that Pokémon you have...\nCould it be that rare white specimen?\c\nThere cannot be more than one such\nspecimen in the world!\c\nSo pure... So sublime...\nIts sparkle is indeed the ultimate!\c\nI would love to see how it would\nstand up to Steven’s Beldum...
I want you to go to [VAR COLOR(0002)]Granite Cave[VAR COLOR(0000)].\c\nBased on our research, you should find the\nkind of [VAR COLOR(0002)]Meteorite Shard [VAR COLOR(0000)]that we will need.\c\nI’m counting on you.
Steven seems to have headed out for Meteor Falls.\nI sure hope he’ll find something useful there...
Steven headed for the Mossdeep Space Center a little\nwhile ago.\c\nI hope you’ll deliver the Meteorite Shard to him at once.\nI’m counting on you!

The move Rock Tomb not only\ninflicts damage by dropping rocks,\r\nit also lowers the target’s Speed.\c\nIf you use a TM, it instantly teaches\nthe move to a Pokémon.\c\nYou can use a TM as many times\nas you want, so please try it out!
Since you are so strong, you should\nchallenge other Gym Leaders, too.\c\nBy battling many Trainers, you’ll likely\nlearn many things.

Oh, you there!\c\nYou’re that fantastic Trainer who\nhelped me in Petalburg Woods!\c\nHelp me! I was robbed by Team Magma!\nI have to get the Devon Parts back!\c\nIf I don’t...\nI’m going to be in serious trouble...
I think that shady character took off\ntoward the tunnel over there.
Oh! How did it go?\nDid you get my Devon Parts?\c\nYou did! You got them back!\c\nYou really are a great Trainer!\c\nI know! As my thanks,\nI’ll give you a Great Ball!

Oh, yes! Young [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0403)]manlady!\nPlease come with me!
So you made it here to Rustboro, too, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].
So you made it here to Rustboro, too, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!
It’s a real city, huh?\nNothing like Littleroot.
It’s really big here, isn’t it?\nLittleroot can’t even compare.
Oh, did you know?\nThere’s a Pokémon Gym here, too.
Oh, and [VAR TRNAME(0000)], have you heard?\nThere’s a Pokémon Gym here, too!
Soon as I gather a few more Pokémon, I’ll be trying\nmy team against it!\c\nSee ya!
Once I catch a couple more Pokémon, I’ll be sure to\ntake it on with my team!\c\nSee you later!
Hey, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].\c\nHow’s your Pokédex?\nCompleted any entries yet?\c\nMine pretty much rules.\c\nI went on a Pokémon-catching\nfrenzy in Petalburg Woods\r\nuntil I ran out of Poké Balls!
Oh! Hey, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\nHave you been catching lots of Pokémon?\c\nI’m doing pretty good on that front, at least.\c\nI caught so many Pokémon in Petalburg Woods\nthat I ran out of Poké Balls!
Oh, yeah. I passed by\nMr. Briney in Petalburg Woods.\c\nI bet he was on his way home to\nhis cottage on [VAR COLOR(0002)]Route 104[VAR COLOR(0000)].
Oh yeah...\c\nAnd I passed by Mr. Briney when I was\nin Petalburg Woods.\c\nHmm. I guess he must have been on his\nway home to his cottage on [VAR COLOR(0002)]Route 104[VAR COLOR(0000)].
I guess you wouldn’t know, since you\njust moved here and all, but they say\r\nthat old guy used to be an amazing sailor!
[VAR TRNAME(0000)], you just moved here so there’s\nno way you could know, but Mr. Briney\r\nwas once a highly respected seafarer.
“Time-saving tunnel nearing completion!”\c\nThat’s what it says on the sign,\nbut there’s also a big “X”\r\nsplashed across it in red paint...

[VAR TRNAME(0000)]...
I’m sorry about summoning you so suddenly.
It’s well known how often my intuition turns out to\nbe right.\c\nBut I never imagined we would be meeting again\nthis soon!\c\nI’m sorry to say it is not happy news that brings\nus together.
Sigh.\c\nThis isn’t something we should discuss in public.\nLet’s continue this inside.
After you.
Awawawa?!
Waaah?!
Ouch...
Oooh?\c\nYou’re that fantastic Trainer\nwho helped me before!
Yo, geek!
Whoa!\nYou’re the kid Trainer I met before!
Yo, geek!
Whoa!\nYou’re the kid Trainer I met before!
Aiieee!\nYou’ve got to help me, please!
Aargh!\nYou’re getting in my way again!
Grrrr...\nAm I destined to lose to you all the time?
Aargh!\nYou’re getting in my way again!
Grrrr...\nAm I destined to lose to you all the time?
What’s wrong, Grunt?
What?\nYou again?\c\n...Fine.\c\nEven though I know I can’t win, I’m\ngoing to challenge you for Courtney!
Sound the retreat!\c\nIt’s only good sense to save my own hide—\nfor Courtney’s sake!
What’s wrong, Grunt?
What?\nYou again?\c\n...Fine.\c\nSure I know I can’t win, but I’m going to\nchallenge you for Matt!
Sound the retreat!\c\nIt’s only good sense to save my own hide—\nfor Matt’s sake!
I’m hungry, so I’m going back...
Gaaaaah!\c\nWell, my stomach’s ready for battle...\c\n’Cause it’s rumbling...
I lost.\nLike I figured...\c\nI’m gonna get some food on the way back.

Th-th-thank you!\nYou helped me again!\r\nAs my thanks, I’ll give you another Great Ba—
Oh, now is not the time for this!
We’re in big trouble!
Team Aqua stole the control device for the\nLink Cable that our company had been developing...\c\nIt’s a special tool called the dimensional shifter.\c\nThe person who stole it was a huge man\nwith bulging muscles!
Team Magma stole the control device for the\nLink Cable that our company had been developing...\c\nIt’s a special tool called the dimensional shifter.\c\nThe person who stole it was short and pretty,\nand she had a nasty look in her eyes!
What shall I do? What would you do?\nWHAT SHALL I DO?
They must have headed for the\nMossdeep Space Center...\c\nSteven must have gone ahead to the Space Center,\nbut...I’m worried...

Oh, [VAR TRNAME(0000)], you made it!\nI’m sure sorry to call you all the way out here.\c\nWell, I’ve got a favor I need done right away.\c\nI’ve mentioned this before, but that bright,\nflashing light on top of that tower means\r\nsomething may have happened in New Mauville!\c\nThat’s why I called you here. I want you to\ngo check on things in New Mauville.
There’s just one thing, though.\nNew Mauville is usually a prohibited area.\c\nBack in my day, it was just locked up normally,\nbut security has been evolving, too!
Don’t you go anywhere just yet...
Hey, thanks!\c\nI just took a picture of your eyes.\nNow if we just use the computer to transmit this data...
Now if you go to New Mauville,\nthe doors will open automatically!\c\nThe Basement Key has what they\ncall “iris recognition.”\c\nWhen you get inside, go press the\nbutton on the computer in the back.\c\nWhen that computer starts working right,\ncome back here and report to me.\c\nI sure am sorry to bug you with all this,\nbut I’m really counting on you!
All righty then, I’m counting on you\nfor that investigation of New Mauville!\c\nYou can [VAR COLOR(0002)]Surf[VAR COLOR(0000)] from [VAR COLOR(0002)]Route 110[VAR COLOR(0000)]\nto get to [VAR COLOR(0002)]New Mauville[VAR COLOR(0000)].
You’re [VAR TRNAME(0000)], right?\nThank you for taking such good care of my husband.\c\nI do apologize for all the trouble that we may cause you,\nbut please do find some way to forgive us.
Plah! Plah!
Mah... Mah... Mah...
Oh, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]! Sorry to make you come\nall this way. You went out to New Mauville, right?
The results of your investigation\nhave been sent here to my computer, too.\c\nThe most important thing is that there don’t\nappear to be any abnormalities for the time being.\c\nLet me give you this as a way to\nsay sorry for causing you such a hassle.
By the way, there wasn’t anything\ngoing on in New Mauville, right?\r\nThat was supposed to be a new town, though...\c\nWe should’ve been able to build a huge\nunderground city stretching down into the depths.
Things happened, and its development had to\nbe suspended. Since then it’s just been left to rot.\c\nAll the equipment inside might have seen better days.\n
The New Mauville Development Project...\c\nThe development itself was really smooth.\nJust when its completion was right before\r\nour eyes, though, we discovered a problem.\c\nWe realized that if we built a\ntown where people could live,\r\nit would have a negative impact\r\non the Pokémon that live there.\c\nSince then development has been on hold.\nNew Mauville has been abandoned...

I don’t have a name to give you.\c\nIf I ever had one, I forgot it a long,\nlong time ago.\c\nI’m just hollow.
Perfect!
He seems to be a perfect candidate\nfor receiving powers from the five of us.
Receiving powers?\c\nWhat do you mean?\c\nI had no idea so many people\nwere living across the hall.\c\nSeriously, who are you?
It doesn’t matter!\c\nJust hold on to your questions\nand rejoice that we’ve met!

Hey there, Trainer! This is your first time here, right?\nThis food court is a bit strange, so there are\r\nsome rules you have to follow before you eat.\c\nI come here all the time, so I can tell you about them.
Number one!\nPlace your order at the counter!\c\nThere are three items on the menu here,\nso order whatever you like.\c\nWhen you’re done ordering, the\nrestaurant staff will give you a buzzer.\c\nNumber two!\nSit in a chair while you wait for your food!\c\nIt may take a while for your order to be ready.\nHave a seat and wait.\c\nHere’s the important part!\c\nWhile you’re sitting and waiting for your food,\nothers will come and battle you for your seat!\c\nYou have to fight back if you want\nto eat the meal you ordered!\c\nNumber three!\nEat your food!\c\nWhen the buzzer goes off, it means that your\norder is ready to be picked up at the counter.\c\nAll that’s left to do then is to sit back down and eat!\nWhat do you think? Easy, right?
Well, you’ve come all the way here,\nso why don’t you order something?\c\nSince it’s your first time here, maybe\nyou should order the Village Sub Combo.\c\nThat restaurant is a chain from\nUnova that just opened here!\c\nIt’s easy to eat, so it’s pretty popular\nwith kids who like Single Battles.
All right then, see you later!\nEnjoy your time at the Mauville Food Court!
Hey there, Trainer!\nAs long as you’re here, do you have a minute?
I guess the trend is dying out already.\nThe line of customers waiting to order\r\nMagnemite Croquettes has disappeared.\c\nMagnemite Croquettes are a Mauville specialty.\nThey’re made with batter containing a blend of\r\nseveral kinds of broth, grilled on a piping-hot\r\nhot plate, and coated with specially made\r\nsweet, sour, spicy sauce from Johto!\c\nThey’re a cheap gourmet food that’s all the rage\nwith couples and young people who like Double Battles.
You should definitely give them a try, too!\nWell OK then, see you later!
Oh, Trainer!\nAs long as you’re here, do you have a minute?
Maybe it’s because we’ve had fewer\namateurs coming in these days...\c\nThe line of customers lining up for a\nMauville Ramen Bowl has finally cleared out.\c\nThe noodles are soft like Jigglypuff’s cheeks\n(not that anyone would ever consider biting them...),\r\nthe soup is golden like lightning,\r\nand the ingredients are piled as high as Mt. Chimney.\c\nIt’s a local Mauville specialty that even makes\ndiscerning people who like Triple Battles say, “Wow!”\c\nMauville Ramen Bowls are an edible\nlegend here at the Mauville Food Court.
You want to try it, don’t you?\c\nYou have to come prepared if you want\nto eat a Mauville Ramen Bowl, though...\c\nSee you later, Trainer!\nI look forward to seeing you again sometime!
I lost...\c\nThat chair...\c\nI had always felt out of place\nat home, at school...everywhere.\c\nThat chair was the only\nplace I could ever relax...\c\nThat’s why I crushed everyone who\ntried to battle me for this seat.\c\nIn time I became like the ruler of this place...\nI became the Fare Prince!\c\n...But that’s all over now.\n...It’s over for me.\c\nI realized something during\nmy battle with you, Trainer.\c\nI don’t need to find my place...\nI need to make a place for myself.
Trainer...\c\nI can no longer call myself the Fare Prince...\nThe title is yours now.\c\nAnd so, from now on, you\nwill be Fare Prince the Second!\c\nI’ve decided to go make a place for myself.
Trainer...\c\nI can no longer call myself the Fare Prince...\nThe title is yours now.\c\nAnd so, from now on, you\nwill be the Fare Princess!\c\nI’ve decided to go make a place for myself.
The next generation...\nTake care of Mauville Food Court for me!\c\nI hope I can see you again somewhere someday!\nOK then, see you later!
Your buzzer is buzzing!\nTime to go get your food!
Would you like to order the Village Sub Combo?\nThat will be $[VAR NUM5(0000,002C)].
Presenting the Village Sub Combo, a low-priced\ncombo meal with a Berry sandwich and fried Berries!\c\nIt’s wildly popular with kids who like Single Battles!
Your order has been placed,\nso please take this buzzer.\c\nYour meal will be ready in [VAR NUM1(0000)] turn[VAR NUMBRNCH(0000,0100)]s.\nPlease have a seat and wait.
I am terribly sorry to have to tell you this,\nbut you don’t have enough money.
I am quite sorry, but would you be so kind as to bring\nat least [VAR NUM1(0000)] Pokémon with you before making this order?
So sorry to keep you waiting!\nHere’s your Village Sub Combo!
It’s ready and fresh from the oven!\c\nThank you so much for coming just\nwhen everything is at its most delicious!\c\nThis is free of charge, so please feel free to take it!
I’m very sorry.\c\nThe bread has become ever so slightly dried out,\nbut the flavor itself is still passable.
I’m really quite sorry, but\nwe’re completely sold out today.\c\nPlease do come again another day.
Indeed. We hope to see you again sometime.
Hey! Stay away from that chair!\nI saw it first!
Well, I lost, so there’s nothing I can do\nbut look for another chair somewhere...
The seats here have to be won, OK?\nThe world of food is harsh, too!
If you lose, you can’t sit down to eat.\nThe world of food really is harsh.
No matter what, that chair is mine!\nIf you don’t get up, I’ll force you to get up!
Too bad...\nI wanted to sit in that chair...
Give up that seat!\nIf you won’t, we’ll have to battle!
I don’t feel like I could beat you...\nThere’s nothing for me to do but go somewhere else.
I always eat here! If you get in my way,\nmy Fairies will Curse you!
Ahh... My...\nMy chair was defiled...
Hey? Is it Magnemite Croquettes you want?\nThat’ll be $[VAR NUM5(0000,002C)].
Magnemite Croquettes are just what they sound like.\c\nThey’re balls of dough that are\ncooked to look like Magnemite!\c\nThey’re a cheap and delicious meal\nthat’s all the rage with guys and gals\r\nwho like Double Battles!!
All right! One order of Magnemite Croquettes\ncoming up! Please take this buzzer with you!\c\nThat’ll be ready in [VAR NUM1(0000)] turn[VAR NUMBRNCH(0000,0100)]s. Sorry, friend, but\nwould you have a seat and wait?
Enough with the jokes! That’s not enough money, is it?
Sorry, buddy, but if you wanna eat\nMagnemite Croquettes, you’re gonna need [VAR NUM1(0000)] Pokémon!
Hey, thanks for waiting!\nHere are those Magnemite Croquettes.
Nice timing, friend! They’re still pipin’ hot right now!\nI sure am glad you get to eat ’em while they’re hot!\r\nJust for you, this is on the house!
Well, it might have gone a bit cold.
Sorry! We’re already all sold out today!\nCome on back tomorrow!
Huh? Is that so?!\nAll right then. See you next time!
...The one to sit there will be me. If you’re going\nto get in my way, make ready your Poké Balls!
Fine. I’ll let you sit there for now.\nThere’s no way I’ll lose next time, though!
Hey, hey, hey! Wait up!\nThat seat was made for me!
Hey, you did pretty well for yourself there!\nI’ll go ahead and stop there for now.
Hey, what do you think you’re doing?!\nDon’t take my chair away from me!
Oh! What’s going on?!\nMy Magnemite Croquettes are getting cold!
I’d appreciate it if you didn’t get the wrong idea.\nIt’s not like that chair is open for you to sit in it.
I’ve been defeated...\nCould you be the one I’ve heard of?
Oh...\nYou’re brave, aren’t you?
Hmmph... Fine...\nGo on and stuff yourself...
Taking a seat from another customer\nmakes everything more delicious!
Just keep that seat warm...\nI’ll be back for it someday...
A Mauville Ramen Bowl...\n$[VAR NUM5(0000,002C)].
We’ve got nothin’ but ramen...\c\nOnly people who like Triple Battles\ncome to chow down on it, though.
OK...take this buzzer.\c\nIt’ll be [VAR NUM1(0000)] turns until it’s done.\nSit and wait quietly...
That’s not enough money...
You’re gonna need at least [VAR NUM1(0000)]\nPokémon if you wanna eat here...
OK...here’s your Mauville Ramen Bowl.
No... Wait...\c\nYou know what’s coming...\nTake this, too...
You beat him, huh?\c\nAnd you even know just\nwhen the noodles are done...
You’re late, so the noodles got all soggy.
We’re all out of soup today.\nCome back tomorrow if you want some.
All right...
Are you trying to tell me some little wimp\nlike you is encamped at this chair?
Don’t you know? Around here...\nThe Fare Prince’s...
I was wondering what kind of Trainer could have\ntaken out my bro, but you don’t look like you’re all that!
No... You’re just like him...\c\nI shouldn’t have taken you lightly\njust ’cause you’re just a kid, though.
At last, luck is on my side!\c\nThat chair...that piping-hot Mauville Ramen Bowl...\nAll of it...ALL of it is mine!
This is no good! Hurry up and get me\nanother chair before my noodles get soggy!
My uncle let me have his\nPokémon just for today!\c\nThere’s no way I’ll lose!\nToday is the day I make that chair mine!
Even...my uncle’s...Pokémon...\c\nJust...who...exactly...are you?!
I can’t go all out against a kid.\nCan’t you just lose and run along somewhere?
That strength...\nCould you be the one I’ve heard about?!
I’m prepared.
The boss didn’t say anything about this!\nJust who in the world are you?
Hmmph... So you’re my opponent...\nAll right... I’ve got no complaints.
Hmmph! To think that I would throw my\nhands up in defeat. You’ve got my respect.
I knew you’d win your way through.\c\nFrom when we first met, I had a feeling\nthat someday we’d end up meeting here.\c\nBut...\c\nYour sitting in that chair is a sin\nthat shall not be forgiven.\c\nThat chair was made only for the\nroyalty of the Mauville Food Court.\c\nThat’s right, it’s a chair\nmade for me, the Fare Prince.\c\nWell then, it’s about time for you\nto behold the power of the prince.\c\nThe Trainer or the noodles...\nWhich will get soggy first?!
All right! Get your rear out of that chair!
Ha...hahahaha...
The royal throne...and that chair...\nI will take them both for myself!
Hunh... I can’t give up just yet...\nMay we meet again someday...
Place an order
Listen to explanation
Quit
These sandwiches from Unova\nare everything I had hoped for!\c\nMy Pokémon and I are totally satisfied!
The sourness of the Berries and the light and fluffy\nbun are playing a harmony on top of my tongue.
All right! I got to sit down today!\nI’m so glad I borrowed my dad’s Pokémon!
Are you a Trainer?\nThey say there’s a prince here!
Nom-nom-nom... Yummy!
These Berries are a bit bitter.\nI’ll have my Pokémon eat them.
The name of this place is Mauville Food Court.\c\nTrainers are always battling over seats to sit and eat\nat, though, so it’s also known as the Battle Food Court.
Won’t this buzzer hurry up and buzz?\c\nI want to make it to my meal without\nanybody getting in my way...
Oh... It’s actually delicious...\nI can’t get enough of this sauce.
Let me tell you something interesting.\c\nThere’s a time when each of these\ndishes is at its most delicious.\c\nIf you get it on the right turn,\nsomething good will happen.
Can’t you get takeout here?\c\nI want my Pokémon at home\nto taste this flavor, too!
Y’all had better hurry up and\neat before he comes back...
Slurp... Slu-slurp... Oh, it’s good...\nSlurp... It’s seriously good.
One of the Elite Four is named Glacia, right?\c\nI’ve seen her eating ramen here before!\c\nShe was slurping down her noodles at such an\nincredible pace that she was dripping with sweat!
Huh?! You’re getting in line now?!\nThey’re probably already sold out!
I’ve been in line for nearly three hours.\nI wonder if I’ll be able to eat...
Hey! No cutting in line!
Ahh... My legs are so stiff.\nI can’t believe that even I got tired from this line.
When your dish comes out here,\nit has a strange metal lid on it, right?\c\nIt’s called a “cloche” and is used\nat restaurants in the Kalos region.\c\nThe owner here admires Kalos, so he went\nto the trouble of importing them to use here.
[VAR TRNAME(0000)] checked the buzzer!\c\n“Just [VAR NUM1(0001)] turn[VAR NUMBRNCH(0001,0100)]s until your meal is ready.”
Nom-nom...\nIt’s kind of salty today...
All right, what should I eat today?
There’s a sign that says “Staff Only” posted here.
It’s a stand where you can\nput away your cloche after eating.
Our first queen...\nTake good care of the Mauville Food Court.\c\nI hope we can meet again somewhere someday!\nBye-bye for now!

We’re here on a field trip!\c\nI need the host of\nTrend Shoot!\c\nMy mom asked me\nto get his autograph.
Do you know how to use the\ncommunication button on the PSS?\c\nThe PSS is one of the apps of\nthe PlayNav.\c\nYou can use it to get news of\nfaraway friends on the Internet.\c\nThink global! That’s how the\nworld is going.\c\nOtherwise, you won’t be able to\nsurvive in this tough world.\c\nYep, I’m probably the only one in\nmy age group concerned about it!
I’ll be on TV when I grow up!\c\nAnd I’ll talk about wonderful items\nwith Pokémon!
Cha tch tch!
Hey! Hello—you over there.\nDo you know the Hoenn Rangers?
Of course, you don’t know.\nI’m not even surprised.\c\nThe Hoenn Rangers Coexistence Force!\nIt’s all heroes we created to promote Hoenn.\c\nAt least...that was our plan.\c\nBut around the same time as our heroes\ndebuted, the Contest Spectacular got\r\npopular in the Hoenn region, and...\c\nSigh.\nNobody paid any attention to our heroes...
If you hit up souvenir shops, I think you\ncan still find action figures or whatever.\c\nBut they’ve probably been cleared off\nthe shelves already...
You know about them? Really?\nThat puts the heart back in me!
Hoenn’s Local Heroes\nThe Hoenn Rangers Coexistence Force!\c\nWe fight for the peaceful coexistence\nof Pokémon, nature, and people!
Hoenn’s Local Heroes\nThe Hoenn Rangers Coexistence Force!\c\nIt’s an action figure of the powerful yet\nabsentminded hero, Mauville Yellow.\c\nThe number on the price tag is faded by the\nsun, and you can’t tell how much it is.
The shelf is crammed with TV Mauville merchandise.
A poster for the BuzzTV program\n“Special ☆ Spectaculars”\r\nis displayed on the wall.
A poster for the BuzzTV program\n“Secret Base Crashers!”\r\nis displayed on the wall.
A poster for the BuzzTV program\n“MDU: Mirage Detection Unit”\r\nis displayed on the wall.

It’s Telemauv, the mascot character of TV Mauville!
The shelf is filled with files entitled “Press Activity Report.”
It’s the equipment that edits images and music.
It’s a script for Pokémon News!\n
Oh, it looks so GOOOOOOD!\nI wanna dig in right this second!\c\nWha—? You want a battle? Now?!\nOK, it’s time to eat or be eaten!\c\nOur menu’s stocked with dishes too\ngood to miss, and our food court’s\r\npacked with Trainers too good to pass up!\c\nThe Mauville Food Court is open for\nbattle EVERY DAY OF THE WEEK!

The revolutionary Inverse-o-matic machine the\ninventor created can invert type matchups!\c\nFor example, you know Fire-type moves are super\neffective against Grass-type Pokémon, right?\c\nNot with the Inverse-o-matic!\c\nFlip it on, and Fire-type moves become not very\neffective at all against Grass-type Pokémon!\c\nNow try to land as many supereffective hits\nas you can! Get lots and lots of points!
Mumble mumble mumble...\nIt’s very difficult, this shop. Yes, very difficult.\c\nI still can’t even manage to remember all the\ntype matchups for normal battles, and now...
Hey, you. Kid.\c\nYou know about the Ability\ncalled “Mold Breaker”?\c\nIt lets you hit an opponent,\nregardless of its Ability.\c\nIt’s a wicked-useful Ability to\nhave when you just wanna\r\nlet loose on any opponent.

In a Battle Test, you battle against\nfive Trainers in a row without pause.\c\nI will evaluate your skill at Pokémon\nbattling based on those five battles.\c\nYou can receive Battle Points—or BP\nfor short—based on how you battle!\c\nAnd I’ve also arranged for prizes to be\nawarded based on your performance!
In this Battle Institute, we like to have an even\nplaying field, so all Pokémon battle at Lv. 50.\c\nSelect three Pokémon for a Single Battle Test\nand four Pokémon for the Double Battle Test.\c\nAll of your Pokémon and all of the items they\nhold must be different. No duplicates allowed!
Download Tests are special Battle Tests that\ncan be downloaded during certain times via\r\nthe Internet or from a special-event location.\c\nThere are two connections you can use: a\nlocal connection or an Internet connection.\c\nPlease select the appropriate connection\nbased on the environment that you are in.
We hope to see you again!
Even when I make full use of everything I learned,\nBattle Tests are still difficult!
To take a Battle Test, you need to be\nstronger than the Champion...\c\nBattle Tests are taking place in many\ndifferent regions...\c\nThat means there are many Trainers\nwho are stronger than Champions.\c\nI’m curious about how strong Hoenn Trainers\nare compared to Trainers in other regions.
Howdy there, Trainer.\nPlease wait!
You’re a skilled Trainer, ain’tcha?\c\nNo need to say nothin’. Just take this here gift!
It’s a Vs. Recorder!\c\nYou can record battles with friends\nor battles at facilities.\r\nIt’s a purty high-tech device!
It’s a thang that costs tens of thousands,\nbut I don’t need anythan’ in return from you.\c\nIf word gets ’round that a strong Trainer like\nyou uses a Vs. Recorder, I’ll get more\r\ncustomers who want to buy ’em.\r\nThat’s my plan.
In Mauville, there are as many as three places\nwhere your Pokémon can learn moves.\c\nIf you find a rare Pokémon, you may want\nto seek out these places.

A Mach Bike is speedy, but it can’t stop very quickly,\nand that makes it a little tricky to stop the Bike.\c\nRelease the +Control Pad or the Circle Pad\nshortly before the place where you want to stop,\r\nand the Bike will stop at the place you want.\c\nDo you want to read a different page?
There are sandy slopes throughout the Hoenn region.\c\nThe loose, crumbly sand makes it\nimpossible to climb normally.\c\nBut if you have a Mach Bike,\nyou can zip up a sandy slope.\c\nDo you want to read a different page?

Hey, kid, listen to this.\c\nI got this here Metronome that was\nused by a super-famous musician.\c\nIf you’re really desperate, I guess\nI could let it go for, say, $1,000.\c\nHow ’bout it?
Thanks, pal.\c\nSure, I coulda given it to you for nothin’,\nbut that ain’t how the world works, eh?\c\nHere’s how to use it. Hand it to a Pokémon, an’\nthen battle with the same move over and over.\c\nIt’ll get stronger an’ stronger.\nJust keep chippin’ away.
I shoulda said...\nThat super-famous musician I mentioned?\r\nMe.\c\nI’m just too popular for my own good lately.\nI’m not an idol or anything, but I gotta dress\r\nlike this whenever I leave the house or I get\r\nclobbered by fans and paparazzi! Gwahahaheh!
Huh? You don’t really need it?\nBut it belonged to a famous musician...
Hey! You trying to shortchange me, punk?\nI’ll wait, but ya better go get some money!
Wait a sec... Here, you’ve got boatloads\nof Metronomes already, don’t you?!\r\nWhat are you, some kinda Metronome maniac?
...Hey, squirt. You like Pokémon?
...You REALLY like ’em?
...Would you even say you love ’em?
...You’d REALLY say you love ’em?
...Then I’ll give you this.\nHere, take it.
...See, I like Pokémon.
...Tch!
It looks like a real Pokémon, but in fact,\nit is a fantastically realistic model.\c\nIt has a note stuck on it that says,\n“The Rhyhorn Rider is out of order.”
Why would anyone ride on this kinda thing\nwhen we’ve got real Pokémon to ride on?
I used to ditch class to come\nhere when I was a student.\c\nBut I can’t get away with that\nnow that I’m a working man.\r\nSigh...
Gazing at the vastness of the sky,\nwatching the clouds flow...\c\nI imagine soaring through the sky\non the back of a Pokémon...
Lo! Lo! Lo!
Young’un...\nTake a good look at that...
Och, but Taillow is a lucky one...\c\nWay up high...with the touch of\nthe wind ruffling its feathers...
Young’un...\nTake a good look at that...
What could have gotten into our Winona?\c\nStanding there, way up high, feeling the\nwind in her hair...
I feel like a new woman after baskin’ awhile in\nthe sunlight—just like a Grass-type Pokémon!
I feel like a new woman after baskin’ awhile in\nthe sunlight—just like a Grass-type Pokémon!\c\nI reckon I can say that ’cause I’m of an age\nwhere I’ve given up worrying about spots or\r\nwrinkles or such.
I’m an old busybody. What of it!\nI’m not shy of telling you to be nice to folks!\c\nNow then, whippersnapper, get on that PSS\nand start handing out O-Powers!\c\nMake others happy and you’ll find\nyour own happiness, right enough.
[~ 25]
I used to work at Sea Mauville, ages and ages ago.\nBut I still remember it like it was yesterday...\c\nOne of the fellers working under me—can’t even recall\nhis name no more—but I can’t forget him...\c\nThat careless fool, aye, he made a real hash of things\nand I had to let him go. Signed the slip myself.\c\nNot long after he left, though, a letter came for ’im.\c\nIt musta been from someone in his family,\njudging by the name in the return address.\c\nI imagine they musta been worrying about him,\nworking out there on the platform alone and so far away.\c\nBut the postmark, see...\nIt was from long after he’d been let go.\c\nI guess his family never knew the truth of what happened.\c\nI guess he could never bear to tell the truth of it all...\nIt’s a memory that still makes my old heart ache.
I was born and raised in Sinnoh,\nwhile my boy lives off in Kanto.\c\nMy grandson is a designer in Kalos.\c\nMy great-grandson is off dreaming in Unova.\c\nOur family is scattered all over the place!\nBut I don’t feel too lonely as long as\r\nI’ve got this little fella by my side.
Sh-sh-sh-sh-shu.
OK! Hand, please!
A mighty fine Nugget!\nAll yours now.
Hope it pans out for you!
There’s nothing funny about Nuggets.
Eh? Seriously, ma’am?\nYa gonna treat me to dinner?
I told youse I would, eh?\c\nYa managed to become an Ace Trainer, doll.\nWe gotta celebrate somethin’ like dat.\c\nPile up as many o’ dem Village Sub Combos\nor Magnemite Croquettes as ya want.
Thanks, ma’am!\nI’mma take you up on that!
Yeah, kid. You do dat.\nBut dis’ll be our farewell meal, y’unnerstand?\c\nYouse can’t keep hangin’ out wit’ a hood like me—\nnot even one with a fab do like mine.\c\nNot wit’ you bein’ an Ace Trainer an’ all.
M-ma’am...
Bawoh! Bawoh!
Hey! Wait for me-e-e-e-e-e!
I’m getting to be an age when movin’ me\nauld bones ain’t so easy as it used to be.\c\nThat’s why I let wee Poochyena chase after\nme grandson instead o’ taking it on walks.
Contest Spectaculars...\nMaybe I could enter one.\c\nHow do you feel about that, Minun?\nPositive? Negative?
Chirrrirrr!
See there? Take a good look...\c\nRaw talent standing before me...\nFull of fear, yet shining brightly...\c\nThey could be the next big stars\nin the contest circuit... Indeed...\c\n...Hmm?!
Oho...\nLooks like you have quite a bit of promise yourself.\c\nI must push you to participate in the\nContest Spectaculars as well!

It’s an intercom.\nWould you like to press the button?
...There’s no reply.
This is not good.\c\nExcuse me. I’m monitoring the hall\nwith my video intercom.\c\nIf you keep standing there,\nI’ll have trouble seeing the hall.
What do you want?\c\n...Ah, are you my fan?\c\nSorry, but it’s not cool of you\nto invade my privacy like this.\c\nEven without you bothering me,\nI’m already hearing applause from\r\nnowhere every time I play the piano,\r\nwhich really scares me.
Who are you?\c\n...Ah, I see. You’re his fan, too.\c\nTrying to barge into his apartment like that...\nYou don’t even deserve to be called a fan...\c\nBesides, a passion of that level is no\nmatch for my devotion toward him...
Oh, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].\nPlease come in. It’s open.
...Oh, may I help you?\nI don’t really need anything.
No one is here!\nNo one is in this unit!
...
Yo! How many months do you think you\nhaven’t paid for?\c\nIf you don’t pay what you owe, I’ll take\neverything you have, including your Pokémon!
No one is here!\nNo one is in this unit!
Oh, no one is there...\nThen it can’t be helped...\c\nWhat? You’re there, talking!\nDon’t give me that!
Oops...
I’m sorry! I’m sorry! I’m sorry!
You pretended not to be in last month\nand the month before that!\c\nYou and me need to have a long talk.\nLet’s go inside.
Sniffle...
Yo! You’re a Trainer, aren’t ya?\nThen take this.
I got it as security for a loan\nfrom a fool who doesn’t pay\r\nwhat he owes.\c\nA Pokémon would be miserable\nif it bonded with such a fool and\r\nMega Evolved.
By the way, do you have a Lopunny?\c\nI don’t know if there are any in Hoenn,\nbut they’re very cute Pokémon.\c\nThey’re especially cute in Pokémon-Amie.\nTake this as impetus to catch one!
Owning a home was my dream. The dream\nturned into a nightmare called a mortgage...
I realized this after living with my Skitty.\nMy place is too big for the two of us,\r\nand we feel lonely.
Mwut?
Hey, what are you staring at me for?\nI have to wait here for Genesect...\c\nOops, forget what I just said!
Hey, that Pokémon you have...\nIt’s Genesect, isn’t it?\c\nShhhh! Don’t worry!\nYou must be the one to give these to, eh?\c\nSay nothing. Just take them.
Douse Drive...\nShock Drive...\r\nBurn Drive...\r\nand Chill Drive!\c\nJust between you and me,\nthese are some really rare items.\r\nThey come from the Unova region\r\nthrough some shady market, you know?\c\nLet Genesect hold one of these and...\nOh, you already know that, right?
Hey, it’s you!\nYou know what they say?\c\nThat 300 million years ago,\nGenesect ruled the world!\c\nImagine if we suddenly went back in time...\nI’d feel lonely and homesick...and scared!
Oh, you’re such a smooth talker, eh? ♪\nDon’t tease an old woman like me. ♪\c\nWell, I have to admit that I’d participate in the\nContest Spectacular if I were 10 years younger.
My lady, don’t say such things!\nYour beauty has an ageless quality!\c\nLook at me—I’m still on the active list.\c\nMy Pokémon and I love to go out\nand dig for Secret Bases!

When I was a kid, there was nothing around here.\nIt was a very boring rural town.\c\nBut one day, I heard that Wattson would start\nredeveloping this place modeled on a place\r\ncalled Lumiose.\c\nWhen I heard that, a lightbulb went on in my head,\nand I started buying up land around here.\c\nAs a result, I’m now the owner of Mauville Hills.\c\nI can live very comfortably on the rental income.
Do you watch BuzzNav?\c\nPrograms on BuzzNav are broadcast from the\nTV station here to the entire Hoenn region.

Uncle, I’m begging you!
I want to challenge this Gym to see\nhow much stronger I’ve become!
Please! You’ll let me, won’t you?
Now hold on, Wally...
It’s certainly true that you’ve grown quite\na lot stronger alongside your Pokémon.\c\nBut don’t you think that jumping right into\nchallenging a Gym might be pushing it?
I’m not pushing it!\c\nIf it’s me and my Ralts,\nwe can beat anyone!
Ah! [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!
Ralts and I have gotten a lot stronger\nsince we first met. Growing together!
I want to prove that to you\nand my uncle both, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].
Please...help me once more...\c\nAnd have a battle with me!
But if you won’t battle against\nme, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]...\c\nI don’t think my uncle will believe\nthat I’ve really gotten stronger.
Young man...\nYour name is [VAR TRNAME(0000)], isn’t it?
Young lady...\nYour name is [VAR TRNAME(0000)], isn’t it?
I do apologize for asking, but do you think\nyou could battle Wally just this once?\r\nFor his own sake?\c\nIt doesn’t seem like he’ll listen to reason\nthe way he is now...
[VAR TRNAME(0000)], please!\nBattle with me!
Thank you, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].\c\nOK. Here we go!
We’re going to win this, Ralts!\nWe have to!
[~ 18]
Uncle...\nI’ll go back to Verdanturf...
[VAR TRNAME(0000)], thank you...\nBeing a Trainer is tough, isn’t it?
It’s not enough just to battle\nwith your Pokémon.\c\nI can’t become a true Trainer\nlike that... Not really...
Wally, there’s no need to\nget so down on yourself.\c\nWhy, what’s keeping you\nfrom becoming stronger?\c\nNothing is! All you need\nto do is keep growing.
...
Come on, let’s go home.\nEveryone’s waiting for you.
...Yes, Uncle.
[VAR TRNAME(0000)]...
I...\nI’m definitely...\c\nI’m going to get stronger.\nMuch, much stronger!
I feel like I learned a lot from just\none Pokémon battle with you...\r\nAbout my own limits...and Ralts’s...
So...um... That’s why...\c\n[VAR TRNAME(0000)]...\nIf it’s all right... Could I...
Could I call you...my r-riv—
Ah, never mind!\nS-sorry!\c\nIt was nothing!\nPlease forget about it!
Guh...good-bye!
It just dawned on me that you must be\nthe young man who kept an eye out for\r\nWally when he caught his Pokémon.
It just dawned on me that you must be\nthe young lady who kept an eye out for\r\nWally when he caught his Pokémon.
So it’s you we have to thank for Wally\nbecoming so positive about the future.\c\nThank you.
...Ah, here! Take this.\c\nI want you to have it,\nas a bit of a thank-you.
Even if there are obstacles in your path,\nI think you’ll be able to break through them.\r\nEspecially if you use Rock Smash there!
We should head back now, but...\c\nIf you ever have the time, I’d love it if\nyou’d stop by our home in Verdanturf.\r\nI’m sure Wally would enjoy it, too.\c\nWe’ll look forward to seeing you!

Hi there. Welcome!\nThis is a specialty mirror store.\c\nBasically, we deal in mirrors\nand mirrors alone.\c\nWe only exhibit and sell\nmirrors my husband collects\r\nfrom who knows where.\r\nSo we don’t have very many for sale.\c\nThis mirror, by the way, is said to be\nused with Tornadus, Thundurus,\r\nand Landorus.\c\nI have no idea if that’s true.
Hi, there. Welcome!\c\nWait a sec! Don’t tell me that you are with\n[VAR PKNAME(0000)]!\c\nOh, my! That’s awesome!\c\nThis mirror is called Reveal Glass\nand it’s said to be for\r\n[VAR PKNAME(0000)]!\c\nYou can have it. Feel free to use it!\nBut don’t tell my husband about it, okay?
Have you tried the\nmirror I gave you yet?\c\nI feel a bit bad for my husband, but items\nare useless unless you use them, right?\c\nTee hee!\nTrainer, I’m cheering for you!
Welcome, young one.\nHave you ever heard of “reflexology”?\c\nThis is where Pokémon can receive\na massage treatment.\c\nWould you like me to give\nyour [VAR PKNAME(0000)] a treatment?
Sure enough.\nIf you change your mind, I’ll be here!
OK, then!\nGuess I’ll get started on that massage!
[~ 71]
That’s it. I’m all done here!\c\nThe massage made your Pokémon\nmuch more friendly toward you, it seems!
That’s it. I’m all done here!\c\nThe massage made your Pokémon\nsomewhat more friendly toward you, it seems!

I’m the second eldest of four sisters.\nRoute 118 is down this corridor to the east.\c\nYou’ll need a Pokémon\nthat has learned Surf.

I’m the youngest of four sisters.\nRoute 110 is down that corridor to the south.\c\nIt’s a unique route where you’ll find\nCycling Road and the Trick House.
I know that the second floor here is used for apartments,\nbut I have no idea how to get there.\c\nNormally, you’d need to know one of the\npeople who live there to get in...

No, thank you!\nI want to challenge the Gym right away!
What?
Let me see...\nI’m pretty sure the Gym is...
Yup! Straight ahead this way!\nJust through the inner courtyard!
What?\nHey! Wait!
Wally?!
It’s the ticket vending machine\nfor parking Bikes!
Phew...\c\nIt’s actually pretty far, isn’t it?\nAll the way here to Mauville...
So that must be Route 118 ahead...\c\nI wonder what kind of Pokémon I’ll meet there.\nI can’t wait to find out!
I’ll see you later, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\nI’m going straight to Route 118!\c\nLet’s definitely have a battle\nnext time we meet!\r\nIt’s a promise, OK?\c\nAnd you can’t break a promise!

Oh, [VAR TRNAME(0000)], eh?\c\nYou got here just in time to give me\na hand and take a look at this.
This is Square Tower, an attraction\nhere in Mauville City.\c\nIt’s not just for decoration,\nthough. It has a purpose.\c\nIt’s monitoring how things are going\nin a place near here called New Mauville.\r\nTo put it simply, it’s a watchtower.\c\nThe light’s shining brightly now, see?\c\nIt’s warning us that something out of the\nordinary may be going on in New Mauville.
I’ve got something to ask of you, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].\c\nIf we’re going to keep standing around\ntalking, could I get you to come to my place?\c\nI’ve got an apartment on the second floor\nat Mauville Hills.\c\nI’ll let the security guy know, so how about\nyou grab the elevator on the first floor?\c\nI sure am sorry to put you out like this,\n[VAR TRNAME(0000)], but please do come.
Square Tower\c\nThis monument was built to commemorate\nthe friendship between Mauville City and\r\nLumiose City in the Kalos region.
I got all fired up in the Pokémon battle\nand got really hungry, honey!
Me, too, darling.\nFirst, I want to get a Mauville Ramen Bowl.
Boogoogoo.
The second floor here is a high-class\napartment complex called Mauville Hills.
My hometown is Castelia City.\nIt’s as big as this city.
The world is big, isn’t it?\nYou, come to Castelia someday.
It’s the Square Tower!
It’s the Square Tower!\nThe light of the tower is shining brightly!
Tallo!
Hehehe... The view from here.\nOnly tenants can enjoy this privilege...
Mauville City, Sea Mauville on Route 108,\nand New Mauville...\c\nAll of them have “Mauville” in their names, right?\c\nThat’s because some corporate group held\nall the legal rights on every one of them.\c\nBut the group went under, and everything except\nthe name “Mauville” disappeared into thin air.
When I get up in the morning,\nmy family brings me here.\c\nI chitchat with my tea-loving\nfriends, who are also brought\r\nhere by their families.\c\nThen I eat the lunch my family\nprepared for me.\c\nMy family picks me up when\nthe sun sets.\c\nThis is my every day, my lifestyle.\nI have nothing to complain about.
Goo.
All right, made it to Mauville City.
We’ve arrived in Mauville City!

Hoenn boasts an abundance of seafood!\c\nIn particular, the seaweed you get around\nthese parts is fresh and full of life.\c\nWhy, it looks like it could rear up\nand attack!
Do you know the TM Secret Power?\nOur group, we love the TM Secret Power.\c\nOne of our members will give it to you.\nCome back and show me if you get it.\c\nWe’ll accept you as a member and sell\nyou good stuff in secrecy.

A journey to the bottom of the sea...\nI wonder what it’d be like?\c\nI’d love to go deep underwater like\nthat some day.
I wanted to go with Captain Stern on\nthe ocean-floor exploration.\c\nBut the sub’s too small for me.\c\nIf I squeezed in, there wouldn’t be\nany room for the captain...
Those thugs...\c\nThey’re the same lot who tried to take\nthe Devon Parts at the museum...
Hmph...
So you have bothered to chase me,\nMaxie, all the way here from Mt. Pyre...\c\nHohoho.\c\nYou have earned my respect for\nthe persistence you have shown.
However...\nNone can stop us now.\c\nAll that remains is to retrofit this submarine\nand force our way into the Seafloor Cavern,\r\nwhere the great Pokémon sleeps...\c\nOur plans to propel humanity to its ultimate\nheights have entered their final stage.
If you wish to prolong your futile struggle,\nI will not deny your right to try.\c\nOur [VAR COLOR(0002)]hideout [VAR COLOR(0000)]lies in [VAR COLOR(0002)]Lilycove City[VAR COLOR(0000)].\c\nFollow us to our very door if you\nfeel that justice demands it.\c\nAnd now I must be going.\c\nTabitha!
We are in accord,\nLeader Maxie...\c\nYou Grunts, there!
Until our Leader and I, your Admin,\nhave made our escape in the submarine,\r\nstay here and buy us some time!
Yessir!
Yessir!
This way, Leader Maxie...\nWe should make haste.
Let us go.
Mission complete!\c\nLet’s head for the hideout and join\nthe project to modify the submarine!
Yes!\c\nI can’t wait to see the progress\non the submarine.
Impossible!\c\nYou actually followed us\nall the way from Mt. Pyre?
Grah-hah! You got me!\c\nI bow to your persistence and love\nof justice! Bwaha! Bwahahahahah!
It’s a pity, so it is, but we’re well\npast the time when you and your\r\nbest efforts could turn the tide.\c\nWe’ll add a few last touches to\nthis submarine, and we’ll be all set\r\nto bust open the Seafloor Cavern\r\nwhere that great Pokémon is sleeping.\c\nOur plans to return everything\nto the beginning...\r\nThey’re as good as complete!
But I know you gotta do\nwhat you gotta do, scamp.\c\nI’m not gonna tell ya to quit\nchasing us...\c\nFollow us all the way to our\n[VAR COLOR(0002)]hideout [VAR COLOR(0000)]in [VAR COLOR(0002)]Lilycove[VAR COLOR(0000)], if that’s\r\nwhat your honor demands.\c\nNow then... Shelly?
...Got it.
You guys!\c\nKeep that spoiled brat busy until\nthe submarine takes off.
Aye aye!
Ma’am!
Let’s go.\c\nArchie...
Got it.\c\nWe’ll see you there, then!\nMy little scamp adversary!\c\nGrahahaha!\nBwahahahahahahah!
Mission complete!\c\nI’m going to check out the\nmodified sub in our hideout!
I’m psyched to see all\nthe modding on the sub!
M-modding?
Those criminals...\c\nWhat are they planning to do\nwith my Submarine Explorer 1?
They can’t be!
They can’t be after the super-ancient Pokémon\nthat slumbers at the bottom of the sea...
[VAR TRNAME(0000)]...\nI’m sorry, but...
[VAR TRNAME(0000)]...\nI’m sorry, but...
My stolen submarine...\c\nIt could bring an unimaginable\ndisaster upon the world...\c\nSomeone has to get to [VAR COLOR(0002)]their[VAR COLOR(0000)]\n[VAR COLOR(0002)]hideout [VAR COLOR(0000)]in [VAR COLOR(0002)]Lilycove[VAR COLOR(0000)] and stop them!\r\nBut I’ve got no chance alone!
...\c\nSo that’s what they’ve done.\c\nThey’ve defaced my precious submarine, and\nnow they’re aiming for the Seafloor Cavern...
There’s no way a normal human\nwould be able to catch that sub.\c\nAlthough it would be a different\nstory if you could teach a Pokémon\r\nto swim underwater using Dive...
We’re building a new ship with the\nhelp of Mr. Briney, renowned as the\r\nbest sailor in the Hoenn region.\c\nWe’ll let you know when\nshe’s ready to launch!
We’ve finally completed our\nnew ferry, the S.S. Tidal!\c\nShe’s anchored here in the harbor.\nDo give her a look, eh?
Ho! That device you have there is\nthe Scanner from Sea Mauville!\c\nThat could make our expeditions\nreally take off!\c\nWould you do me a favor and let me\ntake that Scanner off your hands?
[~ 53]
[~ 54]
[~ 55]
You drive a hard bargain.\c\nLet me know if you reconsider.
[~ 57]
[~ 58]
[~ 59]
[VAR TRNAME(0000)] handed the Scanner\nto Captain Stern.
Yes! Thanks.\nThis will help our research a lot!\c\nTake this bell as a token of my\nappreciation for your generosity.
That bell figures in old legends from the\nJohto region. It’s pretty nice to have.\c\nWhen I was working on Sea Mauville,\nI had a lad working under me who was\r\nfrom those parts, and he gave me that.\c\nIf I remember rightly, his family passed\ndown some special dance style.\c\nBut it was only for the girls, so as a lad\nhe came here looking for work...
He always kept that bell on his person,\nbut sometimes when we were up top\r\nthere at [VAR COLOR(0002)]Sea Mauville[VAR COLOR(0000)] that bell would ring,\r\nand it would almost seem to glow.\r\nIt sure was mysterious, all right.\c\nI’ve held onto it all these years, but I’d be\nhappy if it could serve you some use now.
[VAR TRNAME(0000)], please...\nMay I ask for your help?
[VAR TRNAME(0000)], please...\nMay I ask for your help?
I can at least get you as far as\nLilycove, where their hideout is...
Do you think you and your Pokémon\ncould put a stop to them and save my\r\nsub from being used for evil? Please!
Thank you!\nWe’ll launch at once!
O-oh...\nTell me if you change your mind.\r\nThere’s no one else I can ask...
This is not just for buying time.\nI’ll flatten you!
I was the one who was flattened...
Seems I have no choice...\c\nIt takes me, a Team Magma Ace Grunt,\nto take care of you!
But, but... I’m a Team Magma Ace Grunt.\nHow could I have lost?
I can fight like Poseidon even on land!
P-P-Poseidon is not so good\nat battles on land!
Hmph! What a pathetic man!\c\nI’m the 26th-strongest Team Aqua Grunt.\nLeave this to me!
I’m the 26th-strongest Team Aqua Grunt.\nBut, but...I lost!
A ferry to Lilycove...
Oh!\nThat ticket!
Are you the one who brought\na weird ticket?
The place you’re trying to go to is\na small island in the south end.
Nobody knows what will happen there...\nI’m so excited that I want to dance a hornpipe!
Hop right on the boat!
I’ll be waiting here.\c\nTake care out there by yourself, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].\nI have faith that you’re up to the task!
Welcome back, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].\c\nSo you actually managed to\nfind it at Southern Island...\c\nThe Eon Pokémon!
Well, then...\nShould we head back to the Gym?

Yes?\c\nIf you’re looking for Stern, that would be me.\c\nAh! Those must be the parts I ordered\nfrom Mr. Stone at Devon.\c\nThank you for bringing the case all this way.\nNow we can prepare for our expedition at last!
Heh heh heh heh...\c\nHold up a moment!\nWe’ll be taking those!
Hah hah hah hah...\c\nJust a moment!\nWe’ll be taking those parts!
Wh-what was that?!\nWho are you people?!
We’re Team Aqua!\c\nOur boss wants the parts in that case,\nso shut your yap and fork it over!
We are Team Magma!\c\nOur boss has need of the parts in that\ncase, so relinquish it to us at once!
Awaaaughhh!\nI got beat by a little brat?
Absurd!\nI was defeated by this child?
Oh, man, what a disaster...\nThe boss is gonna be furious...
This is quite disastrous.\c\nAt this rate, I will become the\ntarget of the boss’s fury!
Hmph! Sniveling wimp!\c\nStand back and watch me, the 27th-strongest\nmember of Team Aqua, take care of this kid!
My, you really are incompetent...\c\nI suggest you observe while a future Ace Grunt of\nTeam Magma makes short work of this infant.
[VAR GENDBR(00FF,0201)]HShe beat the 27th-strongest Grunt\nin Team Aqua?
How could a future Ace Grunt of\nTeam Magma be defeated?
N-now what? If we don’t get\nthat case, we’re in for it!
Wh-what should we do now?\nWe must obtain that case at once!
Arrgh! I never thought we’d be\nstopped by some meddling kid!
Hmph...\c\nI would never have posited that a\nmere child would prove such an obstacle.
What do we have here?\c\nI came to see what was taking so long just to steal a\nfew parts, and I find you simps getting beat by this kid?
Now here I was wondering how you could be\nheld up in the simple act of seizing a case.\c\nDo I take it you are being stymied by this child?
Heh!\c\nThat’s quite a fierce expression for such a wee\nlittle scamp.\c\nThat face tells me you’re not just another mindless\nTrainer brat.
The name is Archie.\c\nThe rough-looking lot you see here are members of\nmy team—Team Aqua.
So tell me, [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0604)]boyogirlie...\c\nDo you know that Pokémon, people, and all\nlife in this world depend on the sea for life?\c\nThat’s right.\c\nThe sea is an irreplaceable treasure for every\nliving thing on this planet.
But with our selfish extravagance, humanity dirties\nthe great ocean, destroying this source of all life...\c\nDay by day, we’re all destroying our most\nprecious resource!
If we humans suffer from our actions, well,\nmaybe we’ll end up getting what we deserve.\r\nBut what about the Pokémon in our world?\c\nThe Pokémon that no longer have a place to\nlive because we stole and soiled their seas?\c\nThe Pokémon that won’t have a place to raise\ntheir young and watch them grow?\c\nWe are creating a world in which innocent\nPokémon suffer as a result of our actions...\r\nAnd that is something that I can’t forgive!
That’s why I came to a decision, see?\c\nThe foolish actions of my fellow humans, the seas we\nhave blighted, nature itself...\r\nI will return everything to its unspoiled beginnings!
...\c\nHeh!\c\nIt’s not like me to talk so much.
Never mind, little scamp...\nI’ll withdraw for now and leave you be.\r\nBut understand this...\c\nGet in my way again, and you won’t\nwalk away unscathed next time.
Remember that, at least!
We’re moving out, lads!
Hmm.\c\nThough you are but a child, your eyes\ntell me of your fierce determination.\c\nMy heart is pounding in my chest...\c\nYes, I think I can see why my lowly Grunts\ncould not stand one minute against you.
I am called Maxie.\c\nI stand as the head of Team Magma, a noble\norganization whose goal is to propel humanity to\r\neven greater heights of progress and evolution.
Indeed.\c\nAnd you are one of the young persons who may shape\nour society’s future.\c\nConsidering that fact, I believe I shall educate you in the\nways of the world.
The land...\c\nIt is the stage upon which humanity stands.\nThe land exists so we humans might continue\r\nonward and upward, stepping into the future...\c\nFor us to continue growing and evolving, humans\nrequire a grand stage upon which to stand.\c\nA land upon which we can stride forward...\nA land we can explore...develop...exploit...\c\nThis is the basis for the growth of all human endeavor.
That is why we, Team Magma, must increase the\nlandmass of this world!
Believe that this will lead to a future of eternal\nhappiness for humanity...\r\nAnd consequently for all life!
Humph.\c\nI suppose the concept may still be too difficult\nfor a child to comprehend. Is that the case?
At least I have tried to open your mind.\nI will take my leave for now.\c\nI suggest you take care that you never again stand\nagainst Team Magma.\c\nI will not be so lenient the next time.
I implore you to remember that.
We are done here.
Young man...\c\nAh, [VAR TRNAME(0000)], is it?\c\nThat was quite a tense situation!\nThank you for helping me out!\c\nOh, yes, I almost forgot that you brought the parts\nfrom Devon!
Young lady...\c\nAh, [VAR TRNAME(0000)], is it?\c\nThat was quite a tense situation!\nThank you for helping me out!\c\nOh, yes, I almost forgot that you brought the parts\nfrom Devon!
[VAR TRNAME(0000)] handed over the Devon Parts\nto Captain Stern.
This is it!\nI can’t be standing around here!\c\nIt’s finally time for us to set out on our\nocean-floor expedition!\c\nThanks for this, and excuse me!
Looking at this model of a ship here reminds\nme of Mr. Briney on Route 104.
Don’t run around inside\nthe museum!
Wow, the submarine’s awesome!\nI want to go for a ride!

Welcome to the Oceanic Museum.\c\nThe entrance fee is $50.\nWould you like to enter?
Enjoy the museum.
Oh? I’m sorry, but you don’t seem to\nhave enough money.
Oh? You’re with that group that\nwent in earlier?\c\nYou’re the only one who’s late.\nYou’d better go catch up to them!
Please visit again!
Excuse me!\nPlease go through reception!
We, Team Aqua, exist\nfor all Pokémon!
We of Team Magma exist\nfor the good of all people!
We were told to assemble here, so\nwe did, but...\c\nThe most important person, our boss,\nisn’t here.
We were told to assemble here, so\nwe did, but...\c\nOur boss, the linchpin, isn’t here.
If I stole the stuff here,\nwould it make me rich?
We might be able to make money\nby stealing things from here.
I can do bad stuff using my power...
I can put my knowledge to use\nin nefarious deeds...
If our goon didn’t bungle things\nin Rustboro, we wouldn’t be here!
If our member didn’t fail in Rustboro,\nwe wouldn’t have to come here!
I didn’t have $50, so it took a long\ntime to get past the receptionist.
It’s a secret that I was stopped at\nreception because I didn’t have $50.
I want to learn about the sea and\nuse that knowledge for battling.
I get all giddy and gooey when\nI see the sea!\c\nFor me, Captain Stern is the\nnumber-one role model!
The sea is vast without end\nand infinitely deep...\c\nThere must be many Pokémon\nthat we don’t know about.
I want a sea Pokémon.\c\nI think it would feel cool and nice to hug.
Aiyeeeh!\nWhat are you doing here?\c\nMe? I’m the Team Aqua member you\nthumped before, remember?\c\nHere, take this!\nYou have to forgive me!
Aiyeeeh!\nWhat are you doing here?\c\nMe? I’m the Team Magma member you\nthumped before, remember?\c\nHere, take this!\nYou have to forgive me!

A blue fluid is spiraling inside a\nglass vessel.\c\nThis is an experiment to create a\nWhirlpool artificially using wind.
A red ball is bobbing up and down\ninside a glass vessel.\c\nThis is an experiment simulating a\nWaterfall using the ball’s buoyancy.
It’s a sample of soil from the ocean floor.\c\nOver many years, the remains of life-forms\nsettle at the bottom of the sea,\r\nmaking sedimentary layers.\c\nAnalyzing these layers reveals the ancient past.

Oceanic Mini Fact 1\nWhy is seawater blue?\c\nLight is composed of many colors.\c\nWhen light passes through water,\nmost kinds of light lose color.\c\nHowever, blue light retains its\ncolor, making the sea appear blue.
Oceanic Mini Fact 2\nWhy is the sea salty?\c\nSeawater contains dissolved salt in\nthe form of sodium and chlorine ions.\c\nThese ions leach out of rocks.\c\nThe concentration of dissolved salt\nmakes the sea salty.
Oceanic Mini Fact 3\nWhich is bigger? The sea or land?\c\nThe sea covers about 70 percent of the\nplanet, and the rest is land.\c\nThe sea is therefore more than twice\nthe size of land.
It’s a Fossil with wavy ridges on it.\c\nSoil on the ocean floor gets scoured\nby the tide.\c\nThe flowing seawater marks the soil\nwith small ridges and valleys.\c\nIf this soil becomes fossilized, it is\ncalled a ripple mark.
A strange machine is rotating under\na glass dome.\c\nMaybe it’s for measuring the depth\nof something...
A rubber ball is expanding and shrinking.\c\nIn the sea, the weight of water itself\nexerts pressure.\c\nIn shallow water, the pressure is not\nvery heavy.\c\nHowever, in extremely deep water,\nthe pressure can reach even tens of\r\nthousands of tons on a small area.

Er-hem! I am the chairman of the\nPokémon Fan Club!\c\nBeing the chairman, I am naturally\nthe most important!
No one could best me when it comes\nto raising Pokémon. No one!\c\nIn any contest, my victory is a\nforegone conclusion!
But that would deprive others of\ntheir enjoyment.\c\nSo I now while away my time\nexamining the Pokémon of others.
It is marvelous to witness how\nothers have raised Pokémon.\c\nThe contented faces of properly\nraised Pokémon...\c\nThe kind and loving gazes of\ntheir Trainers...\c\nMy heart is overwhelmed—there is\nso much happiness.
Oh my! Excuse me! I seem to have\nnattered on far too long!\c\nPlease, do allow me to examine your\nPokémon and see how it’s grown.
How is your Pokémon growing?\nAllow me to examine it.
Hmmhm...\nI see...
Hmmm... It’s not bad, but it’s not\ngood, either.\c\nYou, the Trainer, must put more\neffort into raising this Pokémon!\c\nFor instance, may I suggest that\nyou give it more Pokéblocks?
[~ 8]
Your [VAR PKNAME(0000)], it is growing\nin a most impressive manner!\r\nIt is one fine specimen!\c\nBut! If you let it hold this item, it would\nbecome even more attractive! Indeed!
Let a Pokémon hold that Red Scarf.\c\nEveryone will recognize the coolness\nof that Pokémon!
Let a Pokémon hold that Blue Scarf.\c\nIts beauty will be accentuated much\nmore than now!
Let a Pokémon hold that Pink Scarf.\c\nIt will draw out the cuteness of\nthe Pokémon some more!
Let a Pokémon hold that Green Scarf.\c\nThat will enhance the cleverness of\nthe Pokémon!
Let a Pokémon hold that Yellow Scarf.\c\nIt will bolster your Pokémon’s\ntoughness!
I’m sorry, but I’ve nothing else to\ngive you! None at all!\c\nAfter all, you’re blessed with the gift\nof raising Pokémon without resorting\r\nto any items!
I love seeing Pokémon that are very\nfriendly toward their Trainers.\c\nPokémon are very sensitive to the\nfeelings of their Trainers.\c\nIf you treat your Pokémon with love\nand care, they’ll become friendly.\c\nWhen your Pokémon become friendly,\nplease come show me.
Your Pokémon is really friendly toward you.\c\nFor you, a most compassionate Trainer,\nthis is a gift from the Fan Club!
Pokémon are very sensitive to the\nfeelings of their Trainers.\c\nIf you treat your Pokémon with love\nand care, they’ll become friendly.
If you keep letting a Pokémon faint in\nbattle, it’ll start feeling sorry for itself.\c\nSoon, it will become less trusting\nof its Trainer.\c\nIn other words, it certainly won’t\nbecome friendly toward you.
Do Pokémon enjoy having items used\non them?\c\nMine acted really happy when I gave\nit some Protein.
Fnyaaaa.
Trill...
Marimari?
Do you know the Pokémon Furfrou?\nThey are very rare here in Hoenn.\c\nBut if you have a Furfrou with you,\nI’ll trim it for you for $500.
Oh, dear.\nYou don’t seem to have $500.
Oh, dear. You don’t have a\nFurfrou with you today.
All right.\nWhich Furfrou will I trim today?
And what kind of style were you thinking of?
Heart Trim
Star Trim
Diamond Trim
Debutante Trim
Matron Trim
Dandy Trim
La Reine Trim
Kabuki Trim
Pharaoh Trim
Back to natural
Never mind
Then let’s start.\nPlease stay calm, Furfrou.
Snip...[WAIT 5] Snippity-snip...[WAIT 5]\nSnip-snip... Snip!
Thank you for your patience! It’s all done.\nYour Furfrou looks gorgeous!
All right then!\c\nFirst, I’ll take $500 from\nyou for the trim.
If you ever wish to try out a\nnew style, come back again!
So you would like to keep the same style and just\ntouch up the ends a bit, is that right?
So you’d like to return your Furfrou\nto its natural look. Is that right?
Oh dear! I can’t style an Egg.
Oh, I am sorry, but...\nI can’t trim any Pokémon but Furfrou.
Oh? But your Furfrou already has its natural look.
It’s a portrait of the Pokémon Fan Club’s chairman.
It’s a portrait of a Pikachu in aristocratic clothes.
It’s a photo of a Skitty with an adorable ribbon!
They’re pamphlets for joining the Pokémon Fan Club!
Your [VAR PKNAME(0000)], it is growing\nin a most impressive manner!\r\nIt is one fine specimen!

It’s a blueprint of a ship that is being built.\c\nA memo on it says, “The technology of the\nsuper high-speed rail in Kalos will be used for the\r\nnext-generation propulsion mechanism of this ship.”

You’re an adventurer, aren’t you?\c\nHave you been to Sea Mauville\nnear Route 108?
Ah-huh...\c\nSea Mauville is a unique place. It’s a building,\nyet it’s also a natural preserve.\c\nIf you seek adventure, you should go there.
I’m happy to hear that.\c\nOh, sorry...need to introduce m’self!\c\nI’m Cap’n Salty.\c\nI used to work for Sea Mauville, and I’m\nstill emotionally attached to that place.\c\nSo I’ve always wanted young people to\nknow how great Sea Mauville is.
Oh, how are you doing?\c\nThe other day, I bumped into a guy who\nworked under me at Sea Mauville.\c\nHe seemed pretty successful in his career now,\nbut he was still apologizing for a mistake he’d\r\nmade in the past.\c\nHe said something like, “I’m terribly sorry that I lost\nthe [VAR COLOR(0002)]Odd Keystone[VAR COLOR(0000)].”\c\nI don’t remember it at all, but it made\nme feel nostalgic and happy.

Umm... If this goes here, and that\ngoes over there...\c\nThen where does this thing go?\nAnd what about that doohickey?\c\nAaargh! I can’t make heads or tails\nof this!
Oh, sorry. I’m Dock.\c\nCaptain Stern commissioned me\nto draw up designs for a ferry.\c\nOh! Those parts you have...\nThose are the Devon Parts!\c\nBut...hmm...\nThis won’t do...\c\nI guess Captain Stern is probably\noff at the Oceanic Museum again...\c\nSorry, but could I ask you to find the\ncaptain and give the parts to him?
I guess Captain Stern is probably\noff at the Oceanic Museum again...\c\nSorry, but find the captain and\ndeliver the parts directly to him!
Shipbuilding is an art.\c\nA lot of things can’t be figured\nout by calculations on paper.\c\nI really could use some advice from a\nveteran sailor who knows the seas...
Hey! Mr. Briney agreed to join us and\nlend us his knowledge and expertise.\c\nThe help of a legendary sailor means\nthe ferry plans are really coming together!
It’s finally ready!\c\nOur new ferry, the S.S. Tidal,\nis truly a marvel of technology!\c\nBut I get the feeling we can\nmake something better yet.\c\nYou know, there’s never an end\nto technology’s onward march.
Ah, [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0606)]my ladlassie! It’s been too long!\c\nSince helping you—well, you got this\nol’ seadog wanting to sail the seas again!\c\nSo I decided to help Dock make a ferry!\c\nAfter all, I’ll be able to take even more\npeople across the sea in a ferry!\c\nBut, you know, Dock is really\nsomething special.\c\nWith his knack for technology and my\nexperience of sailin’, together we can\r\nbuild one great ship, for certain!
Pii kweee!
The seasons, the weather, where\nthe moon sits in the sky...\c\nThese and other conditions make\nthe sea change its expression.\c\nThat’s right!\nThe sea is like a living thing!
I get seasick real easily.\nSo I get to help out here instead.

Want to know the trick to battling?\c\nIf you ask me, it’s raising different kinds of\nPokémon in a balanced way.\c\nIt’s no good to make just one of your Pokémon strong.\nIf you end up facing a type that it’s weak to,\r\nit might not stand a chance.
You trade Pokémon with your friends, right?\c\nIf the Pokémon you trade is holding an item when\nyou send it out, it’ll make them twice as happy!

Yeah! I’ve waited so long for this!\nPokémon Contest Spectacular!\r\nI’m going to enter!\c\nBut before I do, I have to catch\nsome Pokémon!
Whew... I’m just bushed...\c\nI hiked over from Mauville City.\nBut, boy, this city’s huge.\c\nIf I’d known that, I would’ve\nridden my Bike here!
Stern, the fellow who built the museum\nhere, also happens to be the leader of\r\nan undersea exploration team.\c\nSo, everyone calls him Captain Stern.
What is that over there?\nThat long line...
When I was a child, I visited the\nmuseum often.\c\nI used to dream about the mysteries\nof the sea after seeing the exhibits.
Hey there! Quit pushing!\nThis is a line, can’t you see?
Team Aqua has a policy of\nassembling and dispersing at the\r\noperation site.
Team Magma’s policy is assembling\nand dispersing at the operation site!
Our boss...\c\nWhat would he want to do\nwith a museum now?
Our boss is brilliant.\c\nBut what would he want to do\nwith a museum now?
What is the new scheme?\c\nOur boss is scary when he’s mad, so\nI’d better not screw things up...
I wonder what’s the new scheme.\c\nOur boss is scary when he’s mad, so\nI don’t want to make any mistakes...
If there’s something we need in the\nmuseum, we should take it all!
If there’s something we need in the museum,\nwe should take the entire museum by force...
Hey, you there!\nDon’t butt in!
Hey, you there!\nDon’t cut in!
A long line, huh?\c\nIt reminds me of the times I lined up to\nbuy smash-hit games...
A long line reminds me of the times\nI lined up to buy very popular games...
Why are we even lining up and paying?\nWe should just march in!
Paying money to enter the museum\nshows the earnest nature of Team Magma!
The sea is just so vast...\c\nCould the sea have been made by the\ntears shed by Pokémon?
When you sink a man-made object into\nthe sea to make a habitat for Pokémon,\r\nit’s called an artificial reef!\c\nWe in Hoenn are well known for our reef.\nWe call it Sea Mauville!
[~ 34]
If you want to change your Pokémon’s nickname,\nget the [VAR COLOR(0002)]Name Rater[VAR COLOR(0000)] to help. He lives in this town.
Any Pokémon you get in a trade, you\ncan’t change its nickname.\c\nThe original Trainer’s love for that\nPokémon is in the nickname.
[~ 37]
Do you know about the [VAR COLOR(0002)]Pokéblock Kit[VAR COLOR(0000)]?
I thought so!\nIt’s a must-have kit for Trainers\r\nwho enter Contest Spectaculars!
With a Pokéblock Kit, you can\nmake candies called Pokéblocks.\c\nMake great Pokéblocks and give\nthem to Pokémon. Their conditions\r\nwill get much better!
I was hoping it was Lisia\nso I could get her autograph.\c\nBut who’s that being interviewed?\nIsn’t that Captain Stern?
What?\nWhat was that?
That lady interviewer is so cool\nand pretty.\c\nWhen I grow up, I’m going to be\nan international journalist!
What? What?\nIs that a premonition that something\r\nbig is going to happen?
Captain Stern says they discovered\nsomething at the bottom of the sea.\c\nI wonder what it is. What could it be?
What?\c\nThe announcement just now...\nWas it about a submarine jack?!
What’s going on here?\c\nDid the good captain come back with\na big fish from the ocean floor?
Captain...\nHe went inside in a rush...\r\nI hope everything is OK.
Hey! Are you watching?\nAm I on TV?
Is somebody going to steal the submarine?\nWill I be on TV again?
A TV interview! Here!\nThe captain’s a celebrity!
Oh no!\nI’ve never imagined that there are people\r\nwho want to jack a submarine!
OK, Captain Stern, a big smile\nfor the camera!
I see, I see. You’ve had a most\ninvaluable experience...
Yes, indeed. And that is why we intend\nto move ahead with our expedition.
That’s wonderful, Captain Stern!\nThank you for taking the time from\r\nyour busy schedule to talk to us.\c\nWe hope we can interview you again\nwith news of more discoveries!
Whew...\c\nThat was my first time being filmed for\nTV. What a nerve-racking experience!
Oh! It’s you again!\nYou’re looking well. Glad to see it.\c\nWe made a huge discovery on our\nlatest expedition to the seafloor.\c\nWe found an [VAR COLOR(0002)]underwater cavern [VAR COLOR(0000)]on\n[VAR COLOR(0002)]Route 128[VAR COLOR(0000)]—and we think it may be\r\nthe den of a super-ancient Pokémon\r\nlong thought to have been extinct.
???: “Ahhh... Ahhh...\nTesting, testing. One, two, three...OK.”\c\n“I hope you’re listening out there...\nCaptain Stern!”\c\n“We of Team Aqua will now be assuming\ncontrol of your lovely submarine!”\c\n“You’ll contribute to our great plan\nof returning everything to the beginning...\r\nI hope you appreciate this great honor!”\c\n“Wah...hahahah!\nBwahahahahahahahah!”

Thank you for helping\nour Wally out back there.
That boy has been sickly since\nthe time he was born, I’m afraid.
That’s why we decided to send him\nto stay with my brother’s family\r\nin Verdanturf Town for a while.
The air is far cleaner there\nthan it is around these parts.
Oh, you’re looking for Wally?\c\nI’m sorry, young [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0403)]manlady, but\nI’m afraid he’s already left.

Wally has gotten so much healthier...\c\nGetting to see him running about freely\nand having fun with his Pokémon...\c\nI’m so glad to see him well, for once...
I’ll be leaving, then.\nGood-bye, Mom! Bye, Dad!
W-wait just a minute!\nWally!
That’s right!\c\nAre you OK?\nYou looked like you were in trouble recently\r\nwhen those strange thugs came around...
Of course!\c\nMy Pokémon and I are fit for anything!
See, [VAR TRNAME(0000)] got my Key Stone back for me.\c\nAnd Mr. Norman gave me a ticket to a resort that sounds\nreally neat.\c\nI can’t wait to go and check it out!
My, my... I never dreamed I would one day think that\nWally was TOO well...
Yes...\nBut he looks so honestly happy...\r\nthat I can’t help feeling happy, too.
The fact that Wally wasn’t hurt was the\nonly silver lining in this incident.\c\nWhat a frightening world we live in.\nYou be careful out there, too.
I can’t forgive anyone who would do such\na terrible thing to a sweet boy like Wally...
Who in the world would\nsteal my Key Stone...
I’m afraid Wally headed out on another\njourney, this time clutching the ferry\r\nticket that he got from your father.\c\nI’m glad that he has so much energy\nthese days, but being overly energetic\r\nbrings us its own set of worries...
Wally...\nI wonder if he’s out there somewhere, giving it his all...\c\nIf you happen to see him, tell him we’re thinking of him...

There are many types of Pokémon.\c\nAll types have their strengths and\nweaknesses against other types.\c\nSome battles will be easier or harder\nbased on the types of your Pokémon.
For example, your Treecko is a Grass type.\nIt’s strong against Water and Ground types.\c\nBut it’s weak against Fire types.
For example, your Torchic is a Fire type.\nIt’s strong against Grass and Bug types.\c\nBut it’s weak against Water types.
For example, your Mudkip is a Water type.\nIt’s strong against Fire types.\c\nBut it’s weak against Grass and Electric types.
Hello there, Trainer!\nYou’ve got a wonderful smile.\c\nIf you can use the PlayNav on your PokéNav Plus,\nI recommend that you renew your profile!

Then, as I promised, we will\nhave a Pokémon battle.
[VAR TRNAME(0000)]...
It makes me happier than I can really describe.\c\nBeing able to have a real battle with my own [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0803)]sondaughter\nlike this.
But a battle is a battle!
I will do everything within my power as a Gym Leader\nto win!
You’d better give it your best shot, too,\n[VAR TRNAME(0000)]!

I can’t believe it.
I lost to [VAR TRNAME(0000)]?
...\c\n...\c\nYou’ve come this far...
That’s how it is, then!\c\nI will give you this.
[VAR TRNAME(0000)] received the\nBalance Badge from h[VAR GENDBR(00FF,0202)]iser dad!
Having that Badge will ensure that Pokémon up to Lv. 60\nwill obey you, even if you received them in trades.
Pokémon that know the HM move Surf will also be able\nto travel over water now.
And this is my gift to you, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].\nI’m sure you’ll be able to use it well.
Retaliate will allow you to take revenge for a fallen\nteam member.\c\nIts power will be doubled if you have a Pokémon use it in\nthe very next move right after an ally faints.\c\nI hope you and your Pokémon will be diligent enough to\nuse it wisely.
...\c\nSigh.
As the Gym Leader, I can’t express how frustrated I am.
But, as a father, it makes me both happy and a little sad.\nIt’s odd.

I’ll see you on your way.\nLet’s get out of here.

Hmm...\c\nI’ll give you a Poké Ball, too,\nso go give it your best!
Wally received a Poké Ball!
Th-thank you, Mr. Norman!
Um...[VAR TRNAME(0000)]?\c\nYou will...\c\nYou will come\nwith me, right?
So did it go well?
Yes, it did! Thank you!
Let me give you back your Pokémon, sir.
And you, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]...\c\nThank you so much for coming with me.
It was all thanks to you two that I was able to\ncatch Ralts.\c\nMy very own Ralts...\c\nI will always, always treasure it!
...Oh! I know!\c\nIt’s not much of a thank-you, but...um...[VAR TRNAME(0000)]?\c\nWill you let me see your PokéNav Plus for a second?
OK, that and...ummm...there!
Wally updated [VAR TRNAME(0000)]’s PokéNav Plus!\c\nYou can now use the PlayNav features\non your PokéNav Plus!
I read in a book how you can use the PlayNav\nto take care of your Pokémon and train them.\c\nAnd there’s even supposed to be this thing\ncalled the PSS, where you can meet up with\r\nother Trainers and battle friends and more!\c\nI’ve wanted to have my own Pokémon for so\nlong...and do all those kinda things together...\c\nSo I’ve had all these kinds of apps installed on\nmy PokéNav Plus for ages! Embarrassing, huh?
I’m going to try my best together with Ralts.\nYou do your best, too, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!
Oh, but my mom’s waiting for me.\nI’ve got to get going!\c\nI hope we’ll meet again, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\nAnd you, too, Mr. Norman!
Hmm.\nThat boy will be worth keeping an eye on.\c\nBut for now...
[VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\c\nIf you want to become strong as a Trainer, listen to\nmy advice.
First head for [VAR COLOR(0002)]Rustboro City[VAR COLOR(0000)], which lies beyond\nthis town.\c\nThere you should challenge the\n[VAR COLOR(0002)]Gym Leader[VAR COLOR(0000)], [VAR COLOR(0002)]Roxanne[VAR COLOR(0000)].
After her, go on to the other Pokémon Gyms and defeat\ntheir Leaders as well.\c\nCollect Badges from them, understand?
Of course, I’m a Gym Leader, too.\nI’m sure we’ll battle one day.\c\nBut that will only be after you’ve become\nstronger, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].
Hm? Weren’t you going to go to\nthe Pokémon Gym in Rustboro?
Sorry, but I don’t get pleasure from battling\ngreenhorn Trainers. There’s no challenge.\c\nI want you to grow much stronger before\nI would consider taking you on in battle.
Come back when you’ve got\nat least, hmm...four Badges!\r\nThen I’ll take you on, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].
I see... So, you’ve beaten the\nGym Leader in Rustboro City.
But there are still many Trainers\nstronger than you, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].
Across the sea in Dewford Town\nis a Gym Leader named Brawly.\c\nYou should go challenge him.
Hm... [VAR TRNAME(0000)]...\nYou’ve gotten stronger.\c\nI can tell by the number\nof Badges you’ve earned.

[VAR TRNAME(0000)], be sure you go and\nvisit your mother from time to time.
I’m going to stay here and\nredouble my training.
It would bother me as a Trainer to\nnot avenge my loss to you, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!
[VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\nHow’s your training going?
I’m proud as a parent that you’ve\nbecome the Champion, [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0803)]sondaughter.
Yo, how’s it going, Champ-to-be [VAR TRNAME(0000)]?
The doors in this Gym open when you beat the\nawaiting Trainers.
Whoops! The doors in this room are already open,\nso don’t attack me!\c\nThe Trainers of Petalburg Gym use all kinds of items.
The door at the left leads to the Speed Room.\c\nThe door at the right leads to the Accuracy Room.\c\nThe room’s name will be on the door,\nso choose carefully.
Once you’ve chosen the door...\nWell, hey, go for it!

[~ 113]
Hmm?\nIs that an Eon Ticket you have there?\c\nHm...it’s been a good 11 years since\nI last saw a ticket like this...
The Eon Ticket is awarded to those\nwho have earned the right to tread\r\nupon the soil of Southern Island...\c\nIn short, it is awarded to those who\ncan wield Mega Evolution, thanks to\r\ntheir bonds with their Pokémon.
Hmm.\nBut, [VAR TRNAME(0000)], you don’t seem to\r\nhave the skill to handle Mega Evolution yet.\c\nContinue to journey across the wide lands\nand sea of Hoenn, and when you do gain the\r\npower to use Mega Evolution, come back here.\c\nThat is when I will teach about just what the\nEon Ticket means.
Mm-hmm!\nThat Mega Bracelet that glitters on your wrist there\r\nproves that you are capable of using Mega Evolution.\c\nThat seals it.\nCome with me, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!
Your meeting Latias is no less than a miracle.
Your meeting Latios is no less than a miracle.
Don’t let such a precious gift go to waste.\nI hope you’ll continue this journey of yours, with just\r\nas much zeal for Pokémon as you’ve shown so far.
Still, you must not think that you\nhave reached your peak as a Trainer.\c\nIt is only after you reach a certain\nheight that the view opens up, and\r\nyou see how far the road stretches.\c\nI want to see you trying to hone\nyourself and your skills even further.\c\nI’ll be behind you, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].

Even if a Pokémon is weak now,\nit will grow stronger if you raise it.\c\nThe most important thing is love!\nLove for your Pokémon!
Do you use Repels?\c\nThey keep Pokémon away, so they’re useful\nwhen you’re in a hurry to get somewhere.
Do you have any Antidotes on you?\c\nIf a Pokémon is poisoned, it will\nsteadily lose HP when battling.\c\nTo make matters worse, the poison\nwon’t disappear after the battle, either.\c\nI recommend you bring some Antidotes\nwhen you set out on an adventure!

My face is reflected in the water.\c\nIt’s a shining grin full of hope...\c\nOr maybe it’s a look of somber silence\nstruggling with fear...\c\nWhat do you see in your face?
Now, la[VAR GENDBR(00FF,0201)]dss, let’s say you have six Pokémon in\nyour team and then you catch another one...\c\nDo you know what happens? It’s automatically\nsent to a storage Box over the PC network!
Petalburg City Pokémon Gym\nLeader: Norman\r\nA man in pursuit of power!
Petalburg City\nWhere people mingle with nature.
Wally’s House
Ah!\c\n[VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\nMr. Norman!
I haven’t seen the two of you in\nsome time. What a coincidence!\c\nI just came back to my parents’ house\nto grab something I’d forgotten.
You look like you’ve been working hard, Wally.\nIt’s clear even without a battle.
R-really? You really think so?\c\nHehe... Thank you!\nThat’s so nice of you to say!
Ah. [VAR TRNAME(0000)], isn’t it?
Ah. [VAR TRNAME(0000)], isn’t it?
I’m glad to see you here.\nI’m Wally’s father, of course.
As you can see, Wally’s health\nhas thoroughly improved.
It’s all thanks to you and your father.\c\nYou two helped Wally catch his first\nPokémon that day. It’s because of you\r\nthat he has a partner of his own now.\c\nThat partner is why he’s grown so strong.\nThat’s my firm belief. So, I thank you.
Yes, that’s it.\c\nSometimes words aren’t enough.\nIt would delight me if you’d take this.
If you’re cleared to use Surf\noutside of battle, you’ll be able\r\nto cross seas with your Pokémon.
[VAR TRNAME(0000)]...\c\nConsidering how much you and Wally have\ngrown, you should be able to handle\r\nwhat lies beyond the sea on [VAR COLOR(0002)]Route 118 [VAR COLOR(0000)]now.\c\nThere are far stronger Pokémon and Trainers\nwaiting for you on Hoenn’s east coast.\c\nContinue your journey and your adventures\nthere. I know you’ll do your best!
Yes, sir!\c\nI will do my best to become\nas strong as [VAR TRNAME(0000)], sir!
I guess I had better start out, then.\nI’m off for now, Dad! See you next time!
Um. Come on, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\nLet’s go together!
Wally...\c\nI look forward to seeing you and\nyour Pokémon grow stronger together.
[VAR TRNAME(0000)]?\nWell, take care of yourself out there.\c\nDon’t forget to drop by Littleroot to\nvisit your mother from time to time!
OK! We’re off!
Be safe out there!
Learn a lot!
...
...
I don’t know what it is, but...
...Hm?
Seeing my little boy all grown up\nand going off on his own...\c\nAs a father, it makes me\nhappy and a little sad...
Hahahah!\nWhat a coincidence!\c\nI caught myself thinking\nthe same thing.
Hohoho!\nIs that so?
...\nBut if only...\c\nIf only my boy keeps growing\nstrong and healthy like that...\r\nI wouldn’t ask for anything else.
Yes. I know exactly what you mean.
Mr. Norman told us to keep going\nbeyond [VAR COLOR(0002)]Route 118[VAR COLOR(0000)], didn’t he...\c\nLet me check my AreaNav...
[VAR COLOR(0002)]Route 118 [VAR COLOR(0000)]is the one east of\nMauville City, huh?
[VAR TRNAME(0000)]! Since we’re both here\nanyway, let’s go to Mauville together!\c\nI’m definitely planning on going to check\nout Route 118 like your dad said!
Not bad...\nIt was a good battle.
Th-thank you, sir!
Come back and challenge me again anytime.\c\nI’ll be looking forward to seeing you and your\nPokémon again when you’re a bit stronger.
Yes, sir! Thank you, sir!\c\nI’m gonna do special training with my Pokémon.\nThen I’ll challenge this Gym again!
Thank you for the battle, Mr. Norman!
Hm?
Why, if it isn’t [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!
So you’ve finished moving in?
I see...\c\nWell...\c\nI guess we shouldn’t stand\naround out here talking.\c\nDo you want to come in for a bit?
We can talk in the Gym.
Tedious...\nbothersome...child...\c\nYou should...\njust be quiet...\r\nand give me...the Key Stone!
I’m telling you I don’t have it!
I already know...\nthat you can...\r\nuse...Mega Evolution!
Argh!\c\nAre you even listening?\nI’ve been telling you—\c\nAh! [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!
...?!
...You.
Aha. ♪\nNice timing...maybe. ♪
I’ll be taking...\nyours first!\c\nGive me...\nthe Key Stone!
Huh...
...No!\nYou’re always meddling!
If that’s...how it is...\nat Meteor Falls...\r\nthe Leader’s...Key Stone...
Thank you so much, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]...\c\nThat strange woman suddenly attacked me,\ndemanding that I hand over my Key Stone...\c\nThe truth is that I couldn’t give it to her even\nif I wanted to. My Key Stone is gone...\c\nI left it in the house when I went out, and it\njust disappeared.\c\nWhat in the world is going on...
If someone like that ever shows up again...\c\nI’ve gotta protect my mom and dad.\nYou be careful, too, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!
You’re such a little pain!\nShut up and give me the Key Stone!
I don’t have it, I tell you!
Don’t play dumb!\nI already know you can use Mega Evolution!
Argh!\c\nAre you even listening?\nI’ve been telling you—\c\nAh! [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!
What the?!
You punk!
Hoohahaha!\nJust in time, aren’t you?
I’m gonna take your\nKey Stone first, you jerk!
Hooaahhh!
You clown!\nAlways gettin’ all up in my business!
If it’s gonna be like that,\nI’m off to Meteor Falls.
Thank you so much, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].\c\nThat strange man suddenly attacked me,\ndemanding that I hand over my Key Stone.\c\nThe truth is I couldn’t give it to him even\nif I wanted to. My Key Stone is gone...\c\nI left it in the house when I went out, and it\njust disappeared.\c\nWhat in the world is going on?
If someone like that ever shows up again...\c\nI’ve gotta protect my mom and dad.\nYou be careful, too, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!

I imagine you must be quite shocked.\c\nSteven: This is a communication mode that Devon is\nstill currently developing.\r\nIt comes installed on every PokéNav Plus.\c\nSteven: I thought I would only use it if I needed to\ncontact you urgently...\c\nSteven: But it looks as though that time has\nalready come.\c\nSteven: I’m sorry to ask this of you, but I need you\nto come to the Devon Corporation in Rustboro.\c\nSteven: There’s something I have to talk to you\nabout—in person...\c\nSteven: I’ll be waiting for you there.

When it’s you and me, [VAR TRNAME(0000)], I feel like\nwe can both show off our best sides!\c\nLet’s do it!
Hmm...\nWe didn’t seem to have it together this time...\c\nOh well! We’ll have to try harder next time!
When I’m battling with you, [VAR TRNAME(0000)],\nI feel like I could beat absolutely anyone!\c\nLet’s totally do it again sometime!
Ah. Right.\nThat’s too bad, but maybe next time!
Let’s do this!\c\nI’m gonna give it my all, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\nWait and see!
Oops...\nBoy, they were tough, huh?\c\nLet’s try to win next time!\nI’ll try to get stronger, too!
We did it, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\c\nYour team and mine together won’t lose to anyone!
Aw, that’s a shame. But I get it...\nLet’s battle together again some other time!
I hope you can bear with me, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\c\nI’m going to take this chance to study\nhow a Champion fights from right up close!
I’m s-sorry...\c\nI guess me and my team\njust got in your way...
Thank you so much, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\c\nMe and my Pokémon both gained a lot\nfrom being able to fight beside you!
O-oh...\nThat’s too bad...\c\nI hope you’ll ask me\nagain someday...
Bwahahaha!\nYou wanna team up with me?\c\nAll right! This might be the strongest\ncombo that Hoenn’s ever seen!
Bwahahaha!\c\nEven with a combo like you and me, looks like\nwhen you’re gonna lose, you’re gonna lose!\c\nBut I just can’t quit Pokémon battling, not as\nlong as it sets my heart racing like this!
Bwahahahaha!\c\nLooks like teaming up with you and your team\nreally gave us the chance to run wild out there!\c\nThanks for the good battle, ya little scamp!
So we’re going to wrap things up here today?\c\nFair enough. But give me a shout next time\nyou want a little tussle. I’ll be waiting!
So you wish for the great Maxie\nto battle alongside you...\c\nHehehe...\nMy heart trembles in anticipation!\r\nThis should be a fascinating battle!
So the great Maxie has fallen, even\nwhen battling alongside your team...\c\nI shall commit this curious phenomenon\nto memory. It had less than a 1 percent\r\nprobability of occurring, you know.
Hehehe...hahaha!\c\nThis result was inevitable the moment\nthe great Maxie joined hands with you!\c\nShould another such opportunity occur,\nI anticipate a similarly beneficial outcome.
All things must inevitably\ncome to an end.\c\nBut I look forward to the\nprospect of a new beginning.
I’d be honored.\c\nI anticipate that battling together with\nyou will help me realize something new!
It is what it is.\c\nWe lost the battle, but I was\nstill able to learn something.\r\nThank you.
It is what it is.\c\nSo it is only natural that our\nChampion-level combo would win.
I see.\nSo this is the end for us today?\c\nI don’t believe you gave it\nall you have in you.\c\nThe unplumbed depths of your\ntrue power are quite frightening.\c\nStill, I look forward to battling\ntogether again someday.
Scouting the Pike Queen—done.\c\nAre there any Trainers who measure\nup to Scott’s expectations?
The upper level is a viewing area\nfor folks like us who don’t battle.\c\nThey sure fleece us for the privilege,\nbut the matches you get to see are the best!
Wh-who are you?\nThe sight of you set\r\nmy Seviper shivering!
I’ve been watching the matches from up here, but\nthe Trainers here are rank amateurs to the last.\c\nThe only ones here who even begin to compare\nto me in terms of skill and beauty might be those\r\ngaudy little girls calling themselves Battle Chatelaines.
Slaaah...
Wha— You want me to restore\nyour Pokémon’s health?\c\nHonestly, you people!\nCan ye not see I’m off duty?\c\nDo I look like I’ve got a device to\nheal ye tucked in my skirt pocket?\c\nThe Pokémon Center I work at\nnever gives me a day off!\c\nThis is my first time off in 20 days.\nLeave me in peace, can ye?
Did you see them? DID YOU?!\c\nThe stunning Battle Chatelaine sisters!\nThey’re here now!\c\nSeeing them battle was like\nCupid’s arrow right to my heart! BAM!
An endless banquet for Trainers who have had\ntheir hearts captured by Pokémon battling...\c\nFor us serious battlers, this place is both the\nultimate dream and our worst nightmare.

I heard that this house is a re-creation\nof a building in the Kalos region and\r\nthe event that takes place in the building.
Oh! It’s you!
You’re here, too, huh?\c\nI guess when Trainers find out about a\nfacility like this, it gets their blood pumping.\c\nThis place reeks of hard-driving Trainers.
Who, me?\c\nI came to ask that guy Steven to come to the\nPokémon League.\c\nThat guy really goes for it when it comes to the\nBattle Maison.\c\nHe’s been hanging around here where he can\nhave different battles than in the Pokémon League.\c\nAnyway, I came to bring him back, but it looks like he\ndodged me...
Well, I said what I came to say. I’m going back to\nEver Grande.\c\nYou’re going to try your luck at the Battle Maison,\ntoo, right?\c\nIf you see that guy, say hi for me.\nSee you later.
[VAR TRNAME(0000)]!
This monument was built to\ncommemorate you, wasn’t it?
That’s amazing!\c\nYou really are Hoenn’s top\nTrainer, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].
How naive you are...
Um... You are...?
There’s no end for battles\nin the Battle Maison!\c\nUnknown strong Trainers like us\nkeep battling, hoping to achieve\r\n100 or even 200 consecutive wins!
That many?!
A battle is like a house of cards!\nIt’s like a midsummer night’s dream!\c\nRecords will be broken sooner or later.\nAll we can do is train hard every day!
I see...
Well, I’m going to excuse myself now.\nYou two, try hard!
So there are still other Trainers who are\nthat passionate about Pokémon battles...\c\nWow! I feel like trying harder seeing that.\nI’m sure I can still become stronger!
I’ll see you later then, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\nI’m going off to train some more!
I heard that my muse, Mademoiselle\nEvelyn, is touring the Hoenn region,\r\nso I used everything I had saved\r\nand came all the way from Kalos!\c\nI won’t have the energy to stock shelves\nunless I see her dainty face!

Ah! [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\nSo you came, too!
Mr. Norman actually gave me a ticket\nas well.\r\nI just got here a little while ago.\c\nSo this is the Battle Resort...\c\nA tropical paradise that only the lucky few get\nto visit...
Ahyahya!\nVery well then, Leader Maxie.\r\nThe time has come for us to...
...Fight!
Hmph.
Oof! Ow!
Hmm?
I’m s-sorry, ma’am, sir...\nRunning into you like that...
Hummph!\nSir?!
...Ma’am?!
...
Hey!\c\nI, Tabitha, have only just turned 27!\nHow old do you think I am?!\r\nI shall never forgive you!
I’ll...make him cry...
Ah...
Leader?\nIs this that child...
Hmm... Indeed.\c\nThe hero who crushed Team Aqua’s\nhopes and saved the world.
I had not expected to meet you here.
Are you a friend to that young man who just left?\c\nHis whole body seemed to hum with his eagerness\nfor battle...\r\nHe must be quite the Trainer.
It seems that I may get to battle both\nyou and that young man here...\c\nFuhaha! It appears that coming to this\nisland may prove worth the trouble yet!
There has been something on my mind\never since the incident in Sootopolis...\c\nIn another time, or perhaps another world,\none only a fraction of an inch removed from\r\nour own, it seems very likely that it would\r\nhave been us in Team Magma standing\r\nagainst you in that battle...\c\nPerhaps we would have been the ones\ntrying to revive Groudon and obtain its\r\nterrible power for ourselves...
But of course it is pure fantasy.\nTalking about other worlds, or alternative realities...\c\nIt is just a dream for those of us living in the\npresent world.\r\nFuhahaha...
Ah, yes.\c\nBut now that I’ve had the good fortune to\nmeet you again, I should give you that thing...
Courtney?
...Yes?
You have to...take care of it...
I look forward to a day when my Pokémon\nteam might face yours in battle.\c\nUntil that day...
Ahya!\nAnd with that, we bid you adios!
You...seem fun. ♪\c\nTarget...locked...
Aha. ♪
See you later, Archie.\nDo it right.
Fight on, bro!
Aye aye!\nTake care of the crew while I’m away!
[~ 34]
Hyo!
I’m s-sorry, ma’am, sir...\nRunning into you like that...
Ma’am...
Oho?!
Hmm. Interesting.
Wh-what?!\nIt’s that brat!\c\nNo matter how you look at it,\nI’m a “miss,” not a “ma’am”!
What an honest kid...
Oh!
Huhn?!\nIs this that kid...
Ahhh, yeah.\c\nThe scamp of a Trainer who put a stop to\nTeam Magma and that Groudon of theirs.
To think I’d run into you here.
And that little runt there,\nhe’s one of your friends?\c\nHe only passed us by, but I\nfelt a real fire for battle there.\r\nHe must be some Trainer.
Looks like I’ll get to take on the both\nof you if I keep battling here a while!\c\nBwahahaha!\nLooks like it won’t be a waste that I\r\ncame all the way out here after all!
I’ve gotta say...it’s been weighing on\nmy mind ever since Sootopolis, but...\c\nYou know, if we lived in a slightly\ndifferent world, it might have been me\r\nand my crew that you’d had to stop...\c\nIt’s not a stretch to think that we might\nhave tried reviving Kyogre to try to\r\nuse its power for ourselves... You know?
Bwahahaha!\c\nIt’s nonsense, of course!\nIt’s not like there could be another\r\nworld out there just like ours, eh?\c\nThat’s why we dream, right? Wahaha!\n’Cause we know our dreams can’t be real!
Ah... But since we did get to\nrun into each other like this...\c\nI think I’ll give this to you!
Matt!
Yeah, bro!
This is a gift from my bro!\nTake good care of it.
I look forward to pitting my team\nagainst yours someday!\c\nSee you then!
Wouldn’t you know it...\nHe can really make a girl’s eyes sparkle.\c\nHe’s always like that when\nhe meets strong Trainers.\c\nThat’s what I like about him, though...
Muwahahahaha!\nThat’s fun! You’re crazy fun!\c\nI can tell how strong you are\neven though we’re not battling!
I’ll be looking forward to when\nme and my bro squash you!
Hmmph...I’d like to go there.\nIf there is a world like that...
Oh-hoh!\nSounds fun!
Ahyahya!\nSo very intriguing!
Might be...nice...
I’m getting pumped just standing here!\nLet’s check it out!

Battle Maison Replica\nKalos comes to life in the birthplace of the Battle Maison!
The Battle Frontier Project Has Started!\c\nThe First Battle Frontier Facility\nThe Battle Tower Building Model
Yo, wassup?\nStart a battle already!
Huh! Ground types? See if I care.\c\nIf y’all are too scared of my\nBug-type Pokémon, I’ll battle\r\nwith another Trainer instead!
Hey, you and your Pokémon look cool.\c\nNow be my Bug-type Pokémon’s warm-up,\nwill ya?
Y’all are so lame.
Ugh. Y’all are strong...\nI should’ve battled that Ground-type Trainer.\c\nBut I won’t lose tomorrow!\nI’ll get ya for this!
Uh, uh, are you challenging me to battle,\nknowing I’m a Ground-type-Pokémon user?
(Yikes. This Bug-type-Pokémon user...\nHe’s rude and kinda scary...)\c\nUh, uh, uh, unfortunately, I’ve already promised\nto battle with h[VAR GENDBR(00FF,0202)]imer.\c\nRight?
Th-th-that’s right!\nLet’s start a battle!
Hey...hey!\nPlease read the situation, please!
Thank you! You saved me!\nIf something happens again, help me again.
Have you seen the sign?\c\nThe Battle Resort is still popular,\nbut there is a plan to make it a\r\nmore special and robust battle\r\nfacility called the Battle Frontier!
This area is always hot, so you can\nhave hot battles anytime you want!\c\nThe person who created this\nBattle Resort has great taste.
I usually keep my cool, but I can feel the\nblood pumping through my veins here.
The shining sun?\nThe sparkling beach?\c\nMeh. Not my thing at all.\c\nThe only thing I care about is the\nexcitement of scorching-hot battles!
This place is the best!\c\nIn addition to the beach surrounding the\nisland, there’s even a Pokémon Day Care!
Will you come see the Battle Resort’s\nfamous Whismur show?
Yay!\nI’m going to get all fired up!
That’s too bad... I guarantee it’s great.\nCome see it next time!
OK! Whismur!\nEveryone, gather round!
The Whismur that you will\nbe following today is...
Ta-da! The Whismur\nwith the winsome eyes!
Ta-da! The Whismur\nwith the fluffy ears!
Ta-da! The Whismur\nwith the chubby cheeks!
Ta-da! The Whismur with\nthe cute little hands!
It has [VAR iCOLOR2(0000)][VAR ITEM2(0000)].\nAll right. Let’s start!
Whim, whim. ♪
OK! Find the Whismur that\nI asked you to follow!
That Whismur is holding\n[VAR iCOLOR2(0000)][VAR ITEM2(0000)], right?
You are...
Totally correct!\c\nReceive your prize, [VAR iCOLOR2(0000)][VAR ITEM2(0000)]\nfrom the Whismur!
Incorrect!\nI’m sorry.
That marks the grand finale of\nour Whismur show!\r\nThank you, one and all!
It looks like the Whismur are tired.\c\nThere are a lot of preparations to make,\nso please come back tomorrow!
Whism, mur...
Look at how the Whismur move...\c\nLooking at them makes\nme feel like dancing!
Wahaha!\nYou really like dancing, don’t you?
Aim for the[VAR COLOR(0002)] Pokémon World Championships[VAR COLOR(0000)]! Aim for the\nworld! I’ll conquer the world with Dragon-type Pokémon!

I’m the custodian here at the Battle Resort.\nAll I do is take the trash out in the morning.\r\nI don’t have much to do.\c\nThat stuff over there is just some junk\nthat I picked up while I was cleaning.\c\nGo on and take anything you think you could use.

Hnh. You again.
I apologize for my actions earlier.\c\nThe truth of the matter is...\nI have no idea in the world\r\nwhat I am doing here...\c\nOr even who I am.
The first thing of which I can remember\nis awakening here upon this beach.\c\nBaffled, lacking awareness of the\ncircumstances that brought me here...\c\nAnd at that moment, you appeared!
I feel...as though I have some duty\nthat I should be accomplishing...\c\nBut of it, I can remember nothing.
Please, pardon me for\ngoing on about myself.\c\nIn fact... I feel quite uneasy.
Of course, I must thank\nyou for finding me.
That, I found in the pocket of\nmy overcoat.\c\nIt was the only thing I had on me.\c\nI do not know if it will prove worth\nanything, but I’m glad to give it to you.
Wh-who am I?\nWho in the world am I?
Poor man.\nIt seems he has amnesia.

If you are a Trainer, will you show me\nhow you’re raising your Pokémon\r\nwith loving care?
Oh! You’re a shy Trainer.
Which Pokémon will you show me?
[~ 3]
Well...it’s a bit hard to tell\nhow much that Egg has grown.
Oh! This [VAR PKNAME(0001)] was level [VAR NUM3(0002)]\nwhen you met. Right now it’s level [VAR NUM3(0003)]!
Wow! This is surprising!\nYou trained the Pokémon this much.\c\nYou’ve raised it very well.\nIt’s received a lot of love from you.
You’ve raised it quite well.\nI feel your love for this Pokémon.
You’ve raised it well.\nI can feel a bit of love from you.
What? It has not grown at all.\c\nStill, if you travel with your Pokémon\nfrom now on, I’m sure it will grow!
You clearly make an effort to travel with\nyour Pokémon and raise them!\c\nThis is a token of gratitude for showing\nme your great love for your Pokémon!
[VAR TRNAME(0000)] received a [VAR BD00(0007,0000,0000)]Footprint Ribbon[VAR BD01]!
[VAR TRNAME(0000)] put the Footprint Ribbon\non [VAR PKNAME(0001)]!
This fantastic Footprint Ribbon shows\nthe love you’ve given to [VAR PKNAME(0001)].
The number of footprints\nshows the amount of your love...\c\nThank you for showing me the wonderful\nbond between you and your Pokémon.
Guwarrr!
Have you heard about the green-haired\nGallade user everyone is talking about?\c\nThey say that he’s been a real hit at the\nBattle Maison—an absolute star!\c\nAnd he’s racking up record after record\nwith his carefully chosen Pokémon...\c\nMy heart starts to race when I think that\nthere might finally be a Trainer worthy\r\nof calling my rival!
You look like you’d be\ngood at Pokémon battles.\c\nThis belongs to someone\nlike you!
The Level Release is a Decoration\nyou can use in your Secret Base!\c\nIf you set it up and activate it in your\nbase, you’ll be able to negate\r\nany level limitations in battle!
A serious battle in a Secret Base,\nwith no limits...\c\nDon’t you get excited just imagining it?

Eek! You...!
So you really came... Blast it...
Hrmph!\nThen I guess I’ve just got to do it...
No! It’s too dangerous, baby!
It’s fine, darling!\nI’ll take care of this!\c\nYou just take this chance to get away!
What are you talking about, baby?\nI couldn’t possibly leave you here!\c\nDidn’t we make a promise to each other?!\nWe’re supposed to survive together!
D-darling...
If we’re going to get caught anyway,\nthen let’s get caught together!\c\nI won’t leave you here alone!\c\nWhatever punishment awaits us for\nbetraying our teams...\c\nWe’ll face it together!
No need to worry about that.
Y-you!!! But why?!
Team Magma...and Team Aqua both...\c\nWe’ve all changed.\c\nAnd all because of this Champion next to me.
Yeah. That’s how it is.
You...
No one’s going to come chasing after a\ncouple of runaways like you anymore.
Then why...\nHow did you even find us?
I know how you think. And besides...\c\nOur leader Maxie came here, too.\nI could guess he had some reason for that.\c\nHe never misses a detail, after all.\nI’m sure he knew the two of you were here.
And our Archie is just the same.\c\nHe’s testing himself against the fine Trainers at the\nBattle Maison, taking a good hard look at who he is.\c\nI don’t think he’s bothered at all about some runaway\nlike you.
So that’s how it is, huh?
You know.\c\nTo be honest, I came here to bring you back with\nme, but looks like maybe I shouldn’t have bothered.\c\nJust...take good care of her, you hear?
You mean...
Well, wonders never cease. To think that little Miss\nMagma and I would arrive at the same conclusion...\c\nBut that’s how it is, so...\c\nYeah. You’re free.\c\nBe as happy as you can be with that fellow of yours.
Y-you busybody...\c\nYou bet I will...
I’m sorry.\c\nI’m a bit overwhelmed by all this.\nCould you come back a little later?
Look, sorry, but...\c\nMy mind’s still whirling.\nCan we do this later?
We’ve been awaiting you, Champion!
You sure kept us waiting, Champ.
We spent a long time thinking things\nthrough after what happened last time.\c\nAnd in the end...we both decided that\nwe should go back to our own teams.
Team Aqua and Team Magma...\c\nWe’ve decided to each go back to our\nown teams...\c\nAnd we were thinking maybe we could\nhelp mediate things between them.
Even a couple of Grunts like us have managed\nto find a way to understand one another.\c\nIt seems like there has to be a way for everyone\nto recognize one another and move forward.
But we were only able to dream of something like\nthat because both teams have changed already...\c\nAnd I think that’s all thanks to what you’ve done.
And so that is why we hoped to\nask you for a favor, Champion.
That’s right. It’s something\nwe could only ask you to do.
I want you to take my Camerupt.\c\nWill you accept it from a\nTeam Magma Grunt like me?
I raised this Camerupt because\nI looked up to Maxie so much.\c\nBut now I want to leave its future\nin your hands instead.
You don’t have any room in your party now.\nPlease come back when you do...
Thank you very much.\nPlease take good care of Camerupt.\c\nIt loves to run more than anything, so\nI hope you’ll play with it a whole lot...
Please. I beg you to reconsider.\c\nI won’t leave this place until you\nchange your mind and accept it.
I want you to take my Sharpedo.\c\nWill you take a Pokémon from a\nTeam Aqua Grunt like me?
I chose to raise this Sharpedo\nbecause Archie was my idol.\c\nBut now I think I’d rather leave\nits future in your hands instead.
Your party’s full right now.\nCome back when you’ve got space.
Thanks for this.\nI’ll leave Sharpedo in your care.\c\nRiding around on this fella’s back\nwhile surfing... It’s the best.
Please! I’m begging here!\c\nAnd I’m not going to move from\nthis spot till you change your mind!
Leaving Camerupt with you was my\nway of cutting ties with the past.\c\nFrom now on, I’m going to do my best\nfor a new Team Magma—with my baby!
I’m leaving Sharpedo with you so I can\nclose the book on that part of my past.\c\nFrom now on, I’m going to do my best to\nmake a new Team Aqua—with my darling.
You received Camerupt!
You received Sharpedo!
Would you like to give a nickname to Camerupt?
Would you like to give a nickname to Sharpedo?

Oh my, you’re a Trainer, aren’t you?\nAnd you came all the way out here?\c\nI live a life free from worldly cares\nhere, just raising Berries as a diversion.
Here, I think I’ll give you one of these Berries.\nI hear that strong Trainers sometimes use them.
If you come again tomorrow,\nI’ll give you whatever is ripe.
Oh my, I am sorry. But I can only\nharvest so many a day.\r\nCome tomorrow if you want more.
I’m gonna win 100 times in a row\nin the Battle Maison.\c\nBut I’m not very good yet...\nSo win 100 times in a row in my place, OK?
What?\nYou won 100 times in a row?!\c\nThat’s so cool! OK, I’ll give you\nthis as a reward!
Maybe you’ll win 200 in a row next...\nYeah, right! Like that could happen!
Y-you won 200 times in a row!\c\nThat’s really, really amazing!\c\nHere, take this reward!
I’ll work hard and become\na strong Trainer like you!

How could I be so careless?\nI lost my purse, and I’m in a somewhat\r\ncompromised situation.\c\nWell, shall I allow you to give me some money?\nYes, $100 would be fine.
You’re unbelievable.\nYou’re missing the opportunity to help me out.
You don’t have enough money.\nYou’re missing the opportunity to help me out.
Fine. You may help me.\c\nHowever, my pride won’t let\nme accept your charity.\c\nTherefore, I will show my generosity\nby giving you this in return.
You may embrace the happiness and\nexpress your gratitude for having been\r\nable to help me every time you use\r\nthe move.

Recently, a new member joined us.\c\nHe has perfect command of a Gallade\nthat Mega Evolves, and he studies\r\nvarious move combinations and the\r\nallocation of base stats.\c\nHe’s a very enthusiastic young man!\c\nHe has a somewhat delicate frame,\nbut I can’t wait to see how he fares!

I may not look it, but I’m very confident\nof my skills in Pokémon battles.\c\nMy favorite type, of course, is Grass.\nNow, battle me!
All right!\nI’ll go all out!
Oh, that’s too bad...\nIf you change your mind, come back, OK?
I lost, but I had a blast!\nLet’s battle again sometime.
The blue sea and the white beach...\nWhat a lovely place!\c\nI’d love my Fairy-type Pokémon to\ngo wild to their heart’s content.\r\nWould you care to help me?
I appreciate it.\nNow, please brace yourself.
My Fairy-type Pokémon said\nthey were very disappointed.
It’s regrettable that we lost...\c\nBut the rippling waves here will\nwash away such a feeling.
Hah...hah... Ugh...\nWhat a stifling place.\c\nThis is just the time for a cool victory\nin Pokémon battle to refresh me!\c\nI’m a Poison-type expert. Why don’t\nyou have a thrilling battle with me?
Hehehe.\c\nFall victim to my dearest\nPoison-type Pokémon!
Humph!\nI’m ready anytime. I’ll be waiting.
I can’t believe...\nMy Poison-type Pokémon lost...\c\nWe...we won’t lose next time!
Hello! Would you like to change the\nmusic and enjoy a different atmosphere?
Did you like it?\c\nIf you want to change the\nmusic again, let me know!
Acknowledged.\c\nI can change the music anytime, so\nwhenever you feel like it, let me know.
This is the Battle Resort.\c\nIt’s a paradise of Trainers:\nby Trainers and for Trainers.

Ugh...
...You.\nI want to ask you something.\c\nWhere...where am I?
Battle...Resort?\c\nIt’s a battle place, yet also a...resort?\nI...don’t...get it.
Hoenn...?
Hey! What happened to you?\nYou’re absolutely soaked to the skin!\c\nEven in a tropical place like Hoenn,\nif you are soaked like that, you’ll catch cold!
Ah...yeah...
Oh, boy. I guess I have no other choice...\nCome to my cottage.
Hoenn region
Battle Resort
Only strong Trainers or wealthy\npeople can come to this place.\c\nEither way, this is the place for\na selected few.
Have you heard a rumor about the running\nprince with green hair?\c\nThey say he appears on the beach around\nhere early in the morning or late at night\r\nand runs around the beach many times\r\nholding a lot of Pokémon Eggs.\c\nAccording to the rumor, he’s a thin, cute,\nand good-looking young man!
I reeeeally wanted to see the battles\nin the Battle Maison live.\c\nSo, I begged and begged my daddy\nto take me here.
Have you heard a rumor about the\nbattle-maniac prince with green hair?\c\nI heard he’s very good looking, and\nmy friend tried to get his attention.\c\nBut he’s very into battles, and all\nhe talked about was something like\r\nbase stats, type matchups, and so on.
Battle Chatelaines are here visiting\nfrom the Kalos region now.\c\nThey used to live in Hoenn, so it’s like\nvisiting home for them.\c\nI hear the Battle Maison started in\na shack that was around here.
I’m old and have been retired from\ntraining for quite some time now,\r\nbut watching battles in the Battle\r\nMaison still makes my heart pound.

There are people who are itching\nto battle on this beach, too.
The other day, when I was swimming,\nI suddenly heard a splash.\r\nSomething fell into the water.\c\nBut there was nothing around me,\nno ship, no flying Pokémon, nothing.\r\nJust the vast spread of the sea...\c\nI wonder what it was...
Wow... Incredible...
Hmmm?
You two...\c\nYou don’t look like spectators.\nYou must be Trainers who came\r\nhere for a challenge, correct?
Challenge?
You see, people who come to the Battle Resort are\ndivided into two types!\c\nThose who come to see battles, and those who come\nto battle!
Oh, is that right?\nBut where can we battle?
What? You don’t know the Battle Maison?!
No, I don’t...
Oh my...\c\nAll right. It’s better to have you experience\nit rather than me explaining it in words!\c\nMake sure you visit the Battle Maison that’s\nup on top of this island’s main hill!
Thank you very much.\nWe will be sure to do that!
All right, then. I’m leaving now.\nGood luck, you two!
The Battle Maison...
I’m curious about what kind of place it is,\nbut I think I’ll take a look around the island first.\c\nI’ve never been so far from home before,\nand I’ve never visited anything like a resort!
So I’ll be off exploring, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].\nBut I’ll see you later!
I hope we can battle again, here in this resort!
Pokémon Day Care Annex\nWe can also raise your Pokémon here.
This place is full of strong Trainers—\nperfect for training!\c\nI’ll gain a lot of experience here and\nenter the [VAR COLOR(0002)]Pokémon World Championships[VAR COLOR(0000)].\c\nThat’s my dream!
To survive in battles here, it’s not enough\nto gain strength in the ordinary ways.\c\nBut there’s Super Training! It’s an effective\nmethod of making your Pokémon stronger.
I’m very careful about selecting\nthe moves to teach my Pokémon.\c\nOf course, my favorite move is Hidden Power.\nIt’s an obvious choice for experts like me.
Thanks to my dad’s Garchomp, I was\nable to achieve 20 consecutive wins. ♪
It’s one thing to enjoy leisurely battles,\nbut real battles can be a severe trial.\c\nTruly strong Trainers sometimes must\nbe prepared to choose Pokémon that can\r\nwin rather than their favorite Pokémon.
Society tends to expect that a man’s value\nis determined by his looks or income, right?\c\nMy take is that a man’s value is determined\nby how strong he is in Pokémon battles!\c\nThis place is filled with Trainers who are\ngood looking AND strong. Perfect! ♪
Good reply! Nice attitude!\nAll right. I’ll give this to each of you!
It’s a Vs. Recorder!\c\nYou can record battles with friends and\nbattles at the Battle Maison.\r\nIt’s a must-have item for a Trainer!
That sounds amazing...\nAre you sure I can have one?
No need to hesitate.\c\nOnce you reach this place,\nyou are our enemies and rivals!\c\nShowing generosity to one’s enemies\nis the obligation of the strong.
Thank you very much!
