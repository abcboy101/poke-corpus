Brilliant! Access was successful!\c\nOne small step for me, but one grand step for\nPokémon HOME!
Hm...?\c\nOh, forgive me!\nI’m not even on-screen!
There we go!
Allow me to introduce myself...
I am the great Pokémon researcher—Grand Oak!\c\nA pleasure to make your acquaintance!
Now then... Forgive me for being so abrupt,\nbut my dream is to create a Pokédex that...\c\nincludes all the Pokémon in the world!
Of course, if I’m being honest, it’s very\ndifficult for me to accomplish this alone.
But, just right now...\nI’ve gained an absolutely grand ally!
Why, you, of course!\c\nI have a favor to ask!
I’ve developed this Pokémon HOME, and I want you to bring\nlots and lots of Pokémon here!
But I’m sure there’s still lots you don’t know about\nPokémon HOME.
No problem at all! Just ask Poké Boy if you\nrun into any issues!

This is the grand Pokédex that Grand Oak whipped up.\nNeat-o, right? It’ll automatically register any Pokémon you bring\nalong to your cozy Boxes here in Pokémon HOME!
Of course it’s a super goal to complete the WHOLE Pokédex with\nevery last Pokémon out there! But, boy, is that ever a lot of work!\nTry using Spotlight Mode to focus in on different regional Pokédexes,\nand keep chipping away at that goal—one region at a time!
But that’s not all! Have you tried giving your L or R Buttons a squeeze?\nPress ’em and you’ll be switched right on over to your Research Tasks!\nGrand Oak himself wants YOUR help with his great research,\nso help an old man out, won’t you?
[~ 206]
This here is the details screen, where you’ll find all the spiffy key details\nabout your Pokémon crammed into one place!\nGet started off by choosing a Pokémon from the list on the right!
If you want to learn even more about your Pokémon,\ngive your ZL or ZR Buttons a friendly tap, won’t you?\nYou’ll be able to see their Pokédex entries from different games\nyou’ve found ’em in. It’s super nifty!
And if you’ve got Pokémon that you’ve registered in more than one form,\nyou can use those handy L and R Buttons to flip between their forms!\nDid you know that sometimes forms have different Pokédex entries, too?\nBe sure you give ’em all a good look!
And you’ve got the Y Button there to help you check which games\nthat Pokémon appears in.\nThat means you might be able to get the Pokémon in those games!
[~ 211]
This list view lets you just go on and take a gander at all the Pokémon\nyou’ve registered in all their glory! It sure is a sight, isn’t it?\nWhenever you want to take a closer look at any one of your Pokémon\nas you scroll through, give that A Button a little press!
The X Button opens up the filter window! Fwooosh! Just like that!\nYou can filter your list of Pokémon by all sorts of conditions, including\nthings like their types, their main color, or even shape!\nWant to know what my type is? Why, I’m the having-a-ball type!
The Y Button lets you change up the order that your Pokémon are\nsorted in! Sure, you’ve got your familiar old Pokédex-number order...\nBut how about sorting by height or by weight? It’s good to turn things\non their head sometimes and look at ’em from a whole new angle!
[~ 215]
Research Tasks might seem a bit taxing, but they’re really rewarding!\nThey’re requests that come from Grand Oak, see, and what could\nbe better than helping out the grand old gent himself?
If you’ve got save data on your Nintendo Switch from a region\nthat Grand Oak wants to research, then you’ll see task lists start\npopping up for each region on this screen!
But consider this your warning, pal! To complete a task, you’ve got to get\nthe Pokémon Grand Oak is interested in seeing AND get it in that same\nregion as the task belongs to. He’s a bit of a stickler like that!
[~ 219]
On the right side of this screen, you’ve got your list of Research Tasks.\nAll you’ve got to do to complete a Research Task is get your hands on the\nnecessary Pokémon! I bet you’re a catching pro, aren’t you?
But there are still a few little tricks to these tasks!\nEven if you get your hands on the right Pokémon species, it won’t\ncount if it’s from the wrong game or in the wrong form!\nBe sure you check carefully where your Pokémon were caught!
But if you do manage to get the right Pokémon that meet every condition,\nthen all you have to do is bring ’em to your Pokémon HOME Boxes and\nyou’ll find your tasks automatically get marked off as complete!\nYou don’t even have to lift a finger!
And once a task is done, it’s done for good.\nIt won’t be affected if you take the Pokémon you used to fulfill a task\nout of Pokémon HOME or if you decide to let ’em go.\nNo one can take this accomplishment away from you, champ!

When attacked by bird Pokémon, it resists by\nreleasing a terrifically strong odor from its\nantennae, but it often becomes their prey.
Its shell is filled with its soft innards. It doesn’t\nmove much because of the risk it might\ncarelessly spill its innards out.
Close examination of its large eyes reveals that\neach eye is composed of a myriad of tiny eyes.






Its incisors continue growing until its death.\nIf its Trainer doesn’t offer it a file to gnaw on, it\nwill gnaw on door frames, table legs, and so on.
Its hind feet are webbed, so it’s a strong\nswimmer. It can cross rivers and sometimes\neven oceans.
Its short wings make it inept at flying.\nIt moves about hurriedly and pecks at\nBug-type Pokémon in the tall grass.
It’s tough and has excellent stamina.\nIt has no problem flying continuously\nfor a whole day carrying a heavy load.


A plan was recently announced to gather\nmany Pikachu and make an electric power plant.
It unleashes electric shocks that can reach\n100,000 volts. When agitated, it can knock out\neven an Indian elephant.
It can roll its body into a ball. It moves through\nthe desert by rolling at high speeds.
Although they are sharp, its claws and spikes\noften break off. They grow back the next day,\nso it is not bothered by the temporary loss.






Its adorable behavior and appearance make it\npopular with men and women, young and old.\nIts numbers are few, however.
They don’t like to reveal themselves in front of\npeople. They live quietly in packs deep in\nthe mountains.
Its beautiful fur and tails have made it very\npopular. As it grows, its tails split to form\nmore tails.
Legend has it that this mystical Pokémon was\nformed when nine saints coalesced into one.
It hugely inflates its stomach and sings a\nmysterious melody. If you hear this melody,\nyou’ll become sleepy right away.
It sheds its fine fur when the seasons change.\nThe fur is gathered and spun into a\nluxurious yarn.
It sleeps in caves during the day. It has no eyes,\nso to check its surroundings while flying, it\nemits ultrasonic waves.
Its thick fangs are hollow like straws, making\nthem unexpectedly fragile. These fangs are\nspecialized for sucking blood.



No matter how much it eats, the mushrooms\ngrowing on its back steal away most of\nthe nutrients it consumes.
The large mushroom on its back controls it.\nIt often fights over territory with Shiinotic.


It chews on plant roots underground.\nFarmers whose vegetables are vulnerable\nfind it can be quite a pest.
This set of triplets moves cooperatively.\nIt’s the power of teamwork that enables\nthis Pokémon to dig to a depth of 60 miles.
It lies around all day, becoming active near dusk.\nAt night, it wanders the city in search of\nloose change.
It has a violent temperament. It will attack\nanything that looks it in the eye. Its sharp\nclaws inflict deep wounds.
As a result of headaches so fierce they cause it\nto cry, it sometimes uses psychokinesis without\nmeaning to.
It is said that the red part of its forehead\ngrants supernatural powers to those who\npossess one, so it was over-hunted in the past.
It can spontaneously become enraged. Everyone\nnear it clears out as it rampages, and the\nresulting loneliness makes it angrier still.
It has been known to become so angry that\nit dies as a result. Its face looks peaceful in\ndeath, however.
It’s both clever and loyal, but if a stranger tries\nto invade its territory, it barks threateningly.
Overflowing with beauty and majesty,\nthis strong Pokémon appears in ancient\nEastern folklore.
The swirl on its belly is its internal organs\nshowing through. If the swirl is tinged white,\nthat means it’s affected by some disease.
Although it can live on land, it prefers to stay in\nthe water, where it has fewer natural enemies.
Poliwrath in the Alola region are strong\nswimmers that use the breaststroke. Many\nchildren learn to swim by imitating Poliwrath.
It sleeps 18 hours a day. Even while sleeping,\nit will teleport itself to treetops and pick and\neat berries there.
A theory exists that this Pokémon was a young\nboy who couldn’t control his psychic powers\nand ended up transformed into this Pokémon.
It is said to have an IQ of approximately 5,000.\nIts overflowing psychokinetic powers\ncause headaches to anyone nearby.
It loves working out. As it gazes at its muscles,\nwhich continue to swell day by day, it becomes\nmore and more dedicated to its training.
As a result of its continual workouts, it has\ndeveloped tremendous power. It uses that\npower to help people with their work.
It unleashes megaton-level punches that send\nopponents flying clear over the horizon.



They can be found lying dehydrated on\nbeaches, but they are often still alive.\nWhen soaked in water, they will revive.
Normally, it has 80 poisonous tentacles.\nThe longer one has been alive, the fewer\ntentacles it will have.
Its round body makes it easy to pick up,\nbut it is hard and heavy. It’s dangerous\nto play with them as if they were snowballs.
Mossy rocks are its favorite food.\nIt can devour a ton a day while crunching loudly.
Its body can survive dynamite blasts without\na single scratch, but it hates rain and humidity.


Its long tail often breaks off. It doesn’t really\nfeel any pain, though, and the tail grows back,\nso Slowpoke isn’t particularly bothered.
It spaces out while gazing at the sea.\nWith Shellder’s poison flowing through its body,\nit becomes even spacier.
They gather in places where electricity is\navailable. They can be found clinging to the\nsteel towers used to support power lines.
When three Magnemite link together, their brains\nalso become one. They do not become three\ntimes more intelligent.





Its main source of food is the slimy industrial\nwaste of factories. This Pokémon’s numbers\nhave been decreasing in recent years.
The stench it gives off will make your nose\nscrunch up. Still, there are Muk fans who think\nthat’s a good thing.
The hardness of its shell surpasses the\nhardness of a diamond. In days gone by,\npeople used the shells to make shields.
Its hard shell cannot be shattered—not even\nby a bomb. The contents of the shell\nremain unknown.
Should a strange light be seen flickering\nin an abandoned building, Gastly is lurking there.
It strikes at humans from total darkness.\nThose licked by its cold tongue grow weaker\nwith each passing day until they die.
Should you feel yourself attacked by a sudden\nchill, it is evidence of an approaching Gengar.\nThere is no escaping it. Give up.

A Pokémon that nourishes itself by eating\ndreams, it is thought to share common ancestry\nwith Munna and Musharna.
While it is an extremely dangerous Pokémon,\npeople who are in need of a good, sound sleep\ncall it their savior.




Its six eggs use telepathy to communicate\namong themselves. It is believed to carry\nplant genes and the genes of other species.
Each of its heads has its own will. They use\ntelepathy to discuss their plans before coming\nto a joint decision.
When it thinks of its deceased mother, it weeps\nloudly. Mandibuzz that hear its cries will attack\nit from the air.
Originally, it was weak and timid. After evolution,\nits temperament becomes violent, and it begins\nto wield bones as weapons.







The eggs laid by Chansey are rich in nutrients\nand a favorite food of many Pokémon.

Kangaskhan’s maternal love is so deep that it\nwill brave death to protect its offspring.


When the weather grows warm, they form\ngroups and swim upriver. This sight serves\nas a poetic reminder that spring has arrived.
When the weather grows cold, its whole body\nflushes a deep red. This sight serves as a\npoetic reminder that autumn has arrived.
Large numbers of these Pokémon make their\nhome at the seaside. At night, a strange red\nglow radiates from the center of their bodies.
Its shining core is thought to receive and\ntransmit enigmatic signals. It has been known\nto cause headaches in those who approach it.

It confuses its prey with its quick, ninja-like\nmovements. Then, in an instant, it cleaves\nthem with its scythes.

Half of all sudden blackouts are caused\nby Electabuzz gathering at electric power\nplants and gobbling up electricity.
When it’s tired, it leaps into the mouth of a\nvolcano and soaks its body in magma to ease its\nweariness. Its body burns at 2,192 degrees F.
It grips its prey in its pincers and splits them\napart. Although it is a powerful Pokémon, it\ncan’t deal with the cold.
Historically, people in areas all over the world\nhave ridden Tauros, but the practice is said to\nhave started in Alola.
Although weak and helpless, this Pokémon is\nincredibly fertile. They exist in such multitudes,\nyou’ll soon grow tired of seeing them.
A tale is told of a town that angered Gyarados.\nBefore the sun rose the next day, flames utterly\nconsumed the town, leaving not a trace behind.
Its high intelligence enables it to comprehend\nhuman speech. When it’s in a good mood,\nit sings in its beautiful voice.
It can reorganize its cells to make itself into a\nduplicate of anything it sees. The quality of the\nduplicate depends on the individual.
Possessing an unbalanced and unstable genetic\nmakeup, it conceals many possible evolutions.
Its cells are composed of units much like water\nmolecules. It lives close to water and is often\nmistaken for a mermaid.
They send out electrical charges of about\n10,000 volts. Because they are high-strung,\nit can be difficult to grow close to them.
When it catches prey or finds berries, it\nbreathes fire on them until they’re well done,\nand then it gobbles them up.
Roughly 20 years ago, it was artificially created,\nutilizing the latest technology of the time.




A Pokémon from the age of the dinosaurs.\nIt used its sawlike fangs to shred its prey\nbefore eating them.
Its stomach is said to be incomparably strong.\nEven Muk’s poison is nothing more than a hint of\nspice on Snorlax’s tongue.



It grows by molting repeatedly. Boots made from\nthe tanned cast-off skin are a super luxury item.
It has long been thought that its crystalline\norbs are imbued with the power to control\nthe weather.
This Pokémon saved a shipwrecked man, taking\nhim to a remote island—a paradise occupied\nsolely by Dragonite.















They are timid and grow uneasy when not in a\nswarm with others of their kind. The pattern on\ntheir backs differs slightly from one to another.
While it’s believed that starlight provides it with\nenergy, this Pokémon also loves to eat berries.\nIn the daytime, it curls up in the grass to sleep.
It waits intently until its preferred prey, Cutiefly,\ngets caught in its web. In fact, it’s quite a\npatient Pokémon.
There are some areas where people use the\nstring Ariados spins for their own weaving.\nThe resulting cloth is popular for its strength.
Both its legs became wings, and as a result,\nit can’t move well on the ground. All it can do\nis crawl around.
Its two antennae were originally fins.\nIt discharges electricity to stun its prey\nbefore attacking.
Should you peer into the ocean at night and see\na light shining like the stars, that is Lanturn.
It is not yet skilled at controlling electricity.\nIf you take your eyes off it, it may shock itself.
On late nights illuminated by shooting stars,\nit gazes intently skyward, as if thinking of\nits home.
It likes to sing but is not yet good at it.\nWith praise and encouragement, it will get\nbetter little by little.










To avoid attack, it mimics a tree. It will run off\nif splashed with water, which it hates.
They gather on moonlit nights to form a large\nchorus. Their cries sound angry and not at all\npleasant, but they are certainly distinctive.









It can instantaneously sense its opponent’s\nmovements by feeling air currents with its\nfine fur.
When this Pokémon becomes angry, its pores\nsecrete a poisonous sweat, which it sprays at\nits opponent’s eyes.
They awaken at dusk and take wing in the\ntwilight, leading to the expression,\n“Get home before the Murkrow fly.”
A poisonous bite reacted with its system,\nblessing it with the enhanced intellect of a\ngenius. It has full control of its psychic powers.
It will use any means necessary to frighten\npeople and absorb their life energy. It practices\nconstantly to hone its skill in causing fear.








Despite its intimidating face, it’s quite cowardly.\nIts desperate attempts to appear threatening\nmake it popular with people.
Its well-developed lower jaw and heavy fangs\nare its weapons. As long as it’s not provoked,\nit rarely bites.

It uses its wings to adjust its body temperature.\nOtherwise, its metal body would become\ntoo hot and melt in the heat of battle.


It has a cunning yet savage disposition.\nIt waits for parents to leave their nests,\nand then it sneaks in to steal their eggs.






Coral branches grow from its head.\nThey break off quite easily, but they\ngrow back in about three days.


Although it naturally prefers colder locales,\nDelibird in Alola seem able to withstand the\nheat to a certain extent.

Its feathers, which fall off as it grows, are thin\nand sharp. In times long past, warriors used\nthem as swords.





For the purposes of planetary development,\nPorygon was updated with the most\ncutting-edge technology available.

It’s easy to catch, and it grows quickly, making\nit one of the top recommendations for novice\nPokémon Trainers.
Its shell is hard, but it’s still just a bug shell.\nIt’s been known to break, so intense battles\nwith it should be avoided.
When attacked by other Pokémon, it defends\nitself by scattering its poisonous scales and\nfluttering its wings.






With their strong capacity for survival, they can\nlive in dirty places without concern. Left\nunchecked, their numbers multiply rapidly.
Its disposition is far more violent than its looks\nwould suggest. Don’t let your hand get too close\nto its face, as it could bite your hand clean off.
Farmers whose fields are troubled by bug\nPokémon appreciate Spearow for its vigorous\nappetite and look after it.
Drawings of a Pokémon resembling Fearow can\nbe seen in murals from deep in ancient history.


It’s in its nature to store electricity. It feels\nstressed now and then if it’s unable to fully\ndischarge the electricity.
It becomes aggressive when it has electricity\nstored up. At such times, even its Trainer has to\ntake care to avoid being attacked.
It usually makes its home in deserts and arid\nzones, where rain does not fall. It digs holes to\ncatch Bug-type Pokémon.
It uses its claws to climb trees and then curls\nits body into a spiny ball, ready to drop onto\nany prey that appears.






On nights with a full moon, they gather together\nand dance. The surrounding area is enveloped\nin an abnormal magnetic field.
According to tradition, people who see a pair\nof Clefable skipping by can look forward to a\nhappy marriage.
From its mouth spew flames that seem to\nresemble the spirits of the deceased. Some\npeople mistakenly think this fire is a ghost.
Said to live for a thousand years, this Pokémon\nuses its supernatural abilities to manipulate fire.\nIt can burn its prey to a crisp as it pleases.
Jigglypuff possess a vocal range that exceeds\n12 octaves, but each individual’s singing skill\ndepends on its own effort.
As it inhales, it expands...and expands...and\nexpands. Wigglytuff compete to see which one\ncan inflate itself the most.
When exposed to sunlight, they suffer burns.\nThe frequency of their ultrasonic waves can\ndiffer slightly from colony to colony.
Sometimes they drink so much blood, they can’t\nfly anymore. Then they fall to the ground and\nbecome food for other Pokémon.



Mushrooms called tochukaso sprout from its\nback. They can be dried and powdered to make\na medicine used to extend life.
It scatters toxic spores from its mushroom cap.\nOnce harvested, these spores can be steeped\nand boiled down to prepare herbal medicines.


Many farmers cherish and nurture Diglett\nbecause its droppings enrich the soil it lives in.
Despite the closeness between this Pokémon\nand farmers and other people, no one has ever\nseen the parts of it concealed underground.
It loves shiny things. It often fights with\nMurkrow over prey they’re both trying to catch.
It has a high opinion of itself, although not to\nthe same extent as the Alolan Persian. It’s quite\ndifficult to make friends with this Pokémon.
This Pokémon is troubled by constant\nheadaches. The more pain it’s in, the more\npowerful its psychokinesis becomes.
It swims along the banks of lakes and catches\nfish Pokémon. It takes them to the shore and\nquietly eats them up.
Its raging tires it out and causes it to fall asleep,\nbut the anger resonating in its dreams causes it\nto wake up—which infuriates it all over again.
Some researchers theorize that Primeape\nremains angry even when inside a Poké Ball.
It looks cute, but when you approach another\nTrainer’s Growlithe, it will bark at you and bite.
The fire burning inside its body serves as the\nenergy to fuel it as it runs great distances.\nIt appears in many legends.
It’s still not very good at walking. Its Trainers\nshould train this Pokémon to walk every day.
It marches over the land in search of bug\nPokémon to eat. Then it takes them underwater\nso it can dine on them where it’s safe.
Its percentage of body fat is nearly zero. Its\nbody is entirely muscle, which makes it heavy\nand forces its swimming prowess to develop.
It can teleport itself to safety while it’s asleep,\nbut when it wakes, it doesn’t know where it is,\nso it panics.
Kadabra’s presence infests televisions and\nmonitors with creepy shadows that bring\nbad luck.
Its brain cells continue to increase in number\nuntil its death. The older the Alakazam, the\nlarger its head.
With its superhuman strength, it’s able to throw\na hundred people all at the same time. Its\nstrength comes from lifting Graveler every day.
It willingly assists with hard labor because it\nknows the work is good training for its muscles.
It can lift heavy loads with the greatest of ease.\nIt can even heft dump trucks. But its clumsy\nfingers prevent it from doing any precision work.



It drifts in shallow seas, such as the areas near\nbeaches. If you get bitten or stabbed by its\ntoxic tentacles, rush to the hospital.
Although these Pokémon are rare, when a large\noutbreak of them occurs, all fish Pokémon\ndisappear from the surrounding sea.
There are plenty of them to be found along any\nroad. A scholar with too much free time once\ncounted a hundred of them along a single route.
This slow-footed Pokémon moves by curling up\nand rolling instead of walking. With enough\nmomentum, its speed can exceed 60 mph.
Once a year, this Pokémon molts, and its shed\nshell returns to the soil. This process creates\nenriched soil, so farmers collect the shells.


Alolan home cooking involves drying Slowpoke\ntails and then simmering them into a salty stew.
Whenever Shellder bites down hard on its tail,\nit gives Slowbro a flash of inspiration...which it\nforgets a moment later.
It sends out electromagnetic waves, which let it\nfloat through the air. Touching it while it’s eating\nelectricity will give you a full-body shock.
It has about three times the electrical power of\nMagnemite. For some reason, outbreaks of this\nPokémon happen when lots of sunspots appear.





It was born from sludge transformed by\nexposure to X-rays from the moon. When its\ninternal load of germs decreases, it dies.
After recent environmental improvements, this\nPokémon is now hardly seen at all. People\nspeculate that it may go extinct at some point.
This Pokémon’s tongue is always hanging out.\nIt uses its tongue with great dexterity to dig up\nsand from the seabed in its search for food.
Excavation of the tombs of ancient hunting\ntribes has turned up many spears tipped with\nspikes that had fallen off this Pokémon’s shell.
Although Gastly is barely visible, when it’s near,\na faint sweet smell lingers.
It fears the light and revels in the dark. It may\nbe on the verge of extinction in cities that stay\nbrightly lit at night.
It apparently wishes for a traveling companion.\nSince it was once human itself, it tries to create\none by taking the lives of other humans.

It finds really fun dreams tasty. When it makes\nfriends with people, it may show them the most\ndelicious dreams it’s ever eaten.
As a matter of course, it makes anyone it meets\nfall asleep and has a taste of their dreams.\nAnyone having a good dream, it carries off.




Six of them together form a full-fledged\nPokémon. It’s often hunted by Crabrawler,\nbut uses psychokinesis to drive it off.
When the time comes, one of its three heads\nfalls off. Before long, the fallen head grows into\nan Exeggcute.
The skull it wears on its head is that of its dead\nmother. According to some, it will evolve when\nit comes to terms with the pain of her death.
This Pokémon is out for vengeance on its natural\nenemy, Mandibuzz. It throws bones like\nboomerangs to try to take it down.







Not only are these Pokémon fast runners,\nthey’re also few in number, so anyone who finds\none must be lucky indeed.

The child in its pouch leaves home after roughly\nthree years. That is the only time the mother is\nheard to cry wildly.


Spellbound by the length of its horn and the\nbeauty of its fins, many strange Trainers raise\nGoldeen and nothing but Goldeen.
Trainers who are crazy for Seaking are divided\ninto horn enthusiasts and fin enthusiasts.\nThe two groups do not get along well.
This Pokémon gets nibbled on by Lumineon and\nothers. Thanks to its red core, it regenerates\nfast, so it’s unconcerned by their snack attacks.
Its unusual body shape, reminiscent of abstract\nart, led local people to spread rumors that this\nPokémon may be an invader from outer space.

While young, they live together deep in the\nmountains, training themselves in how to fight\nwith their scythes and move at high speeds.

Electricity leaks from it in amounts far greater\nthan the amount of electricity it eats.
When angered, it spouts brilliant fire from all\nover its body. It doesn’t calm down until its\nopponent has burned to ash.
One solid blow from its horns is enough to split\napart a large tree. Its greatest rival in Alola\nis Vikavolt.
Although it’s known to be a fierce Pokémon,\nTauros in the Alola region are said to possess\na measure of calmness.
Its reckless leaps make it easy pickings for\npredators. On the bright side, many Pokémon\nenjoy longer life spans, thanks to Magikarp.
There are people who swear that any place\nGyarados appears is fated for destruction.
These Pokémon were once near extinction due\nto poaching. Following protective regulations,\nthere is now an overabundance of them.
With its astonishing capacity for\nmetamorphosis, it can get along with anything.\nIt does not get along well with its fellow Ditto.
Current studies show it can evolve into an\nincredible eight different species of Pokémon.
Blending in with the water and erasing all signs\nof its presence, it patiently waits for its prey,\nfish Pokémon.
When its fur stands on end, that’s a sign it’s\nabout to give off a jolt of electricity. Take care,\nas sometimes lightning strikes next to it, too.
Its average body temperature is between 1,300\nand 1,500 degrees Fahrenheit. In its internal\nflame sac, temperatures reach 3,000 degrees.
It can convert its body into digital data,\nwhich enables it to enter cyberspace.




In ancient times, it ruled the skies. A widely\naccepted theory is that it went extinct due to\na large meteor impact.
It eats nearly 900 pounds of food every day.\nIt starts nodding off while eating—and continues\nto eat even while it’s asleep.



After a 10-hour struggle, a fisherman was able\nto pull one up and confirm its existence.
From time immemorial, it has been venerated by\nagricultural peoples as an entity able to control\nthe weather.
Incur the wrath of this normally calm Pokémon\nat your peril, because it will smash everything\nto smithereens before it’s satisfied.















They communicate with one another using bodily\nfluids that give off odors. When they’re angry,\ntheir odor smells sour.
In battle, it throws punches with all four arms.\nThe power of each individual blow is piddly,\nso it aims to win by quantity rather than quality.
Some fishermen weave its sturdy thread into\nnets to catch fish Pokémon.
It spins thread from both its rear and its mouth.\nThen it wraps its prey up in thread and sips\ntheir bodily fluids at its leisure.
Silent and swift in its four-winged flight, it bites\ndown on its prey before they realize what’s\nhappening. In a heartbeat, it drains their blood.
It lives in the depths beyond the reach of\nsunlight. It flashes lights on its antennae\nto communicate with others of its kind.
This Pokémon flashes a bright light that blinds\nits prey. This creates an opening for it to deliver\nan electrical attack.
Despite this Pokémon’s cute appearance, those\nwho want to live with one should prepare to be\non the receiving end of its electric jolts.
Because of its silhouette, it’s believed to be a\nstar reborn. For some reason, it loves Minior.
It moves by bouncing along. As it moves a lot,\nit sweats, and its body gives off a sweet aroma.










Apparently, the larger the green parts of this\nPokémon, the more collectors value it. It’s a\nparticular favorite among elderly people.
It’s the leader of Poliwag and Poliwhirl.\nWhen Politoed roars, they all cower in fear.









It unleashes psychic power from the orb on its\nforehead. When its power is exhausted, the orb\ngrows dull and dark.
With its black fur, it blends into the darkness.\nIt bides its time, and when prey appears, this\nPokémon goes for its throat, and then eats it.
Seen as a symbol of bad luck, it’s generally\ndisliked. Yet it gives presents—objects that\nsparkle or shine—to Trainers it’s close to.
This Pokémon is so famed for its intellect that a\nproverb still persists in some regions: “When in\ndoubt, ask Slowking.”
If you hear a sobbing sound emanating from a\nvacant room, it’s undoubtedly a bit of mischief\nfrom Misdreavus.








Its growls make its opponents uneasy. This\nlaid-back Pokémon tends to sleep half the day.
More timid than Snubbull, this Pokémon is doted\non by young people amused at the contrast\nbetween its looks and its attitude.

Once it has identified an enemy, this Pokémon\nsmashes it mercilessly with pincers hard\nas steel.


It uses its claws to poke holes in eggs so it can\nslurp out the insides. Breeders consider it a\nscourge and will drive it away or eradicate it.






Pursued by Mareanie for the branches on its\nhead, this Pokémon will sometimes snap its own\nbranches off as a diversion while it escapes.


It has a generous habit of sharing its food with\npeople and Pokémon, so it’s always scrounging\naround for more food.

Its metal body is sturdy, but it does rust rather\neasily. So on rainy days, this Pokémon prefers\nto stay put in its nest.





Porygon was updated to a new version in\nreadiness for planetary development. But that\ndream remains unrealized as yet.

It draws symbols all over the place to mark its\nterritory. In towns with many Smeargle, the walls\nare covered in graffiti.



This Pokémon is constantly fighting with\nTogedemaru that try to steal its electricity.\nIt’s a pretty even match.
A famous potter lives with a Magby.\nApparently its soft flames produce fine works.
Most people raise it for its milk, but it’s quite\ntough and strong, so it’s also well suited\nfor battle.
Its fluffy fur coat acts as a sensor, enabling it to\nread the feelings of people and Pokémon.



































Fishermen keep an eye out for Wingull in the\nsky, because wherever they’re circling, the\nocean is sure to be teeming with fish Pokémon.
Gathering food is the work of young males.\nThey store food in their capacious beaks and\ncarry it back to others waiting in the nest.



When this Pokémon senses danger, a sweet\nfluid oozes from the tip of its head. The taste\nof it disgusts bird Pokémon.
Its wings and antennae don’t cope well with\nmoisture. After a rain, it faces sunward to\ndry off.











Their daily routine consists of training together\nfirst thing in the morning, eating and napping in\nthe afternoon, and then more training afterward.
They love to compare their freakish strength—\nstrength enough to send a truck flying with a\nsingle slap.

It uses powerful magnetism to drag its prey\ntoward it. It’s also been known to pull in metal,\nwhich it collects and uses to protect itself.


This Pokémon is feared. When its gemstone eyes\nbegin to glow with a sinister shine, it’s believed\nthat Sableye will steal people’s spirits away.















If they scent the faintest trace of blood, they\nrush to attack en masse. When alone, they’re\nrather cowardly.
It has a sad history. In the past, its dorsal fin\nwas a treasured foodstuff, so this Pokémon\nbecame a victim of overfishing.
It shows off by spraying jets of seawater from\nthe nostrils above its eyes. It eats a solid ton of\nWishiwashi every day.
Its immense size is the reason for its popularity.\nWailord watching is a favorite sightseeing\nactivity in various parts of the world.


If the fire burning within its shell goes out, it will\ndie. Those who wish to raise one in their home\nmust always keep something flammable at hand.


Each and every Spinda has a slightly different\nconfiguration of spots. There are collectors who\nenjoy the tiny differences in their spot patterns.
As it digs through the sand, its giant jaws\ncrush any rocks that obstruct its path. It builds\na funnel-shaped nest.
To help make its wings grow, it dissolves\nquantities of prey in its digestive juices and\nguzzles them down every day.
This Pokémon hides in the heart of sandstorms\nit creates and seldom appears where people\ncan see it.








Its slippery body is hard to grasp, so much so\nthat there are festivals where people compete\nto see how many they can catch barehanded.
Sighting Whiscash leaping from the water\nis believed to herald an earthquake.








Although unattractive and unpopular, this\nPokémon’s marvelous vitality has made it a\nsubject of research.
It lives at the bottom of clear lakes. In times of\nwar, it shows itself, which soothes people’s\nminds and hearts.
Its form changes on its own, due to its cells’\nsensitive reactions to temperature and humidity.







Although it’s said to bring disaster, in actuality,\nthis Pokémon possesses a calm disposition and\nwarns people of any crises that loom.

It can only survive in cold areas. It bounces\nhappily around, even in environments as cold as\n-150 degrees Fahrenheit.
Its prey is instantaneously frozen stiff by the\ncold air it exhales from its huge mouth. While\nthey’re in that frozen state, it gobbles them up.






It was fortuitously discovered during a deep sea\nexpedition. Its teeth have atrophied, so it now\nsurvives on microscopic organisms it sucks up.
Loving couples have a soft spot for this\nPokémon, so honeymoon hotels often release\nthis Pokémon into their pools.
With its steel-hard stone head, it headbutts\nindiscriminately. This is because of the stress\nit feels at being unable to fly.
They lurk deep within caves—motionless,\nneither eating nor drinking. Why they don’t die is\nnot known.
It flies around on its wings, which have grown in\nat last. In its happiness, it gushes hot flames,\nburning up the fields it passes over.
With magnetic traction, it pulls its opponents in\nclose. When they’re in range, it slashes them\nwith its rear claws.
It adores magnetic minerals, so it pursues\nNosepass at speeds exceeding 60 mph.
A linkage of two Metang, this Pokémon can\nperform any calculation in a flash by utilizing\nparallel processing in its four brains.































In rock layers where Cranidos fossils are found,\nthe fossilized trunks of trees snapped in two\nare also often found.
Records exist of a revived fossil that evolved\ninto Rampardos. It proceeded to escape and\nthen destroy a skyscraper with a headbutt.
This Pokémon lived in primeval jungles. Few\nenemies would have been willing to square off\nagainst its heavily armored face, so it’s thought.
It lived in the same environments as Rampardos.\nTheir fossils have been found together—\nseemingly from after they’d fought to the finish.










Purple mucus sticks to the hands of anyone\nwho touches it. Take care, as the substance is\ntroublesome to wash off. 
Plankton, invisible to the naked eye, is its main\nfood source. It comes onto the land periodically,\nbut the reason for this is not known.

If for some reason its body bursts, its soul spills\nout with a screaming sound.
Even while under careful observation, large\nflocks of Drifblim flying at dusk will inexplicably\ndisappear from view.


Mismagius have been known to cast spells to\nmake people fall in love, so some people search\nfor this Pokémon as if their life depended on it.
If its Murkrow cronies fail to catch food for it,\nor if it feels they have betrayed it, it will hunt\nthem down wherever they are and punish them.







From its eyes, it can expel excess moisture from\nits body. This liquid is similar in composition to\nhuman sweat.

It’s too small to lay eggs yet. As a surrogate,\nit searches out round white stones.


It skulks in caves, and when prey or an enemy\npasses by, it leaps out and chomps them. The\nforce of its attack sometimes chips its teeth.
Shiny objects are its passion. It can be found in\nits cave, scarcely moving, its gaze fixed on the\njewels it’s amassed or Carbink it has caught.
The protuberances on its head serve as\nsensors. It can even detect distant prey.
When it finds something that looks like it might\nbe edible, it goes right ahead and swallows it\nwhole. That’s why it gets fatter day by day.
It’s tough enough to run right through the night,\nand it’s also a hard worker, but it’s still just\na youngster.
They can detect the species of a living being—\nand its emotions—from over half a mile away.\nThey control auras and hunt their prey in packs.







Its double tail fins propel its energetic jumps.\nWhen it breaks the surface of the sea, Wingull\nswoop down to grab it on the fly.
This deep-sea Pokémon lives at the bottom of\nthe sea. Its fins haul it over the seabed in\nsearch of its favorite food—Starmie.



They dwell in cold places. This Pokémon’s main\nfood source in Alola is Vulpix and Sandshrew,\nwhich they carefully divide among their group.
As it zooms through the sky, this Pokémon\nseems to be receiving signals of unknown origin,\nwhile transmitting signals of unknown purpose.



When it gets excited, it thumps its chest. With\nevery thud, thunder roars and electric sparks\nshower all around.
From its arm, it launches fireballs hotter than\n3,500 degrees Fahrenheit. Its arm starts to\nmelt when it fires a whole barrage.


The younger they are, the more they smell like\nfresh grass. With age, their fragrance takes on\nthe odor of fallen leaves.
It freezes its fur into icicles, spiky and sharp,\nand tackles its prey.


Its program was modified to facilitate\nextra-dimensional activities, but that led to\nnoticeably strange behavior.

The main body controls three mobile units called\nMini-Noses, which it maneuvers to catch prey.

The soul of a woman lost on a snowy mountain\npossessed an icicle, becoming this Pokémon.\nThe food it most relishes is the souls of men.



























The long fur surrounding its face functions as\nradar, enabling it to probe the condition of its\nbattle opponents.
This Pokémon obeys its master’s orders\nfaithfully. However, it refuses to listen to\nanything said by a person it doesn’t respect.
With this wise Pokémon, there could be no\nconcern that it would ever attack people. Some\nparents even trust it to babysit.















The hexagonal cavity is its ear. It walks in the\ndirection of sounds it hears, but if the sounds\ncease, it panics and topples over.
It explores caves in search of underground\nwater. It’s not comfortable around water, so\nthis Pokémon takes great care in lapping it up.
Known for its hefty horsepower, this Pokémon\nis a popular partner for construction workers.



















Pillows and beds stuffed with cotton exhaled\nby Cottonee are soft and puffy, light and airy—\naltogether top quality.
This Pokémon appears, riding upon the wind.\nBut if the wind gusts up, it’ll blow the cotton on\nthis Pokémon’s head clean off.
By pruning the leaves on its head with\nregularity, this Pokémon can be grown into a\nfine plump shape.
As soon as it finds a male to be its partner,\nthe beautiful flower on its head darkens,\ndroops, and withers away.

It conceals itself in the sand and chomps down\non the legs of any prey that unwarily walk over\nit. Its favorite food is Trapinch.
Thanks to the special membrane covering its\neyes, it can see its surroundings clearly, even in\nthe middle of the night.
After clamping down with its powerful jaws,\nit twists its body around to rip its prey in half.










Reputed to be the ancestor of most turtle\nPokémon, it lived in warm seas approximately\na hundred million years ago.
Active both on land and in the sea, this\nPokémon drags its land-based prey into the\nwater to finish it off.
To all appearances flightless, it was able to\nglide down from tall treetops to snag its prey.
They hunted in flocks. When one Archeops had\nthe prey cornered, another would swoop on it.
It gorges on trash until its stomach is full. Then\nit belches toxic gas. An unlucky whiff of gas will\nput a person in the hospital.
For a time, their numbers increased explosively\nin Alola. Since the arrival of Grimer, their\npopulation has decreased dramatically.












It feels pleasantly cool when embraced. This\nPokémon is treasured by households in\nwarm regions.
This Pokémon has existed since the Ice Age. It\ncontrols particles of ice, freezes its opponents,\nand then shatters them with a headbutt.
Even if it loses one of its heads, it can live\nrelatively problem-free. It makes snow clouds\ninside its body.


It grills berries and bug Pokémon with electric\nshocks and makes a meal of them. It usually\nnests in the holes gouged in trees by Pikipek.






They float upon the open sea. Many water\nPokémon gather in the area around Alomomola.
































With its sharp claws, this Pokémon pierces its\nprey, and then it pecks at them. Although it also\nconsumes berries, it’s a carnivore at heart.
It’s thought that people disturbed their habitats\nin the past, so Braviary banded together to\nfight back.
It can’t fly yet and must wait until its wings have\ndeveloped more. Since it’s still at a playful age,\nit hops around friskily.
It circles in the sky, keeping a keen eye out for\nPokémon in a weakened state. Its choicest food\nis Cubone.






























When it’s excited, its temperature can double,\nspiking hormone production in its body.
It will not tolerate other Fletchinder entering its\nterritory, which has a radius of several miles.
It zooms directly at its prey at flight speeds of\nclose to 310 mph, while fiery embers scatter\nfrom gaps in its feathers.










There’s no point to the leaf in its mouth, aside\nfrom an effort to look cool. It’s mischievous,\nso it’s not well suited to inexperienced Trainers.
From the slight twitches of its bamboo leaf, it\ndeduces its opponent’s movements. It’s eager to\ntussle but kindhearted toward its companions.
























When this Pokémon sights its prey, it swirls its\nribbonlike feelers as a distraction. A moment\nlater, it pounces.


Although this Pokémon is not especially rare,\nits glittering, jewel-draped body draws\nattention from people.
Its source of protection is its slimy, germ-laden\nmucous membrane. Anyone who touches it\nneeds some thorough hand-washing.
This Pokémon’s mucous can dissolve anything.\nToothless, it sprays mucous on its prey. Once\nthey’re nicely dissolved, it slurps them up.
It gets picked on because it’s meek. But then,\nwhoever teased it gets to feel the full force of\nits horns and a good swatting from its thick tail.
It inserts its horn into chinks in metal, absorbing\nmetal ions. For some reason, it collects keys.
According to legend, medicine to cure any illness\ncan be made by plucking the green leaves on its\nhead, brewing them, and boiling down the liquid.
Through its roots, it exerts control over other\ntrees. A deadly curse falls upon anyone cutting\ndown trees in forests where Trevenant dwell.








It’s thought to be monitoring the ecosystem.\nThere are rumors that even greater power lies\nhidden within it.



Silently it glides, drawing near its targets. Before\nthey even notice it, it begins to pelt them with\nvicious kicks.
It throws sharp feathers called blade quills\nat enemies or prey. It seldom misses.
Although basically cool and cautious, when it’s\ncaught by surprise, it’s seized by panic.
It doesn’t allow its emotions to be easily seen.\nEarning its trust takes time. It prefers solitude.
It boasts powerful front legs. With a single\npunch, it can bend an iron bar right over.

Bulbasaur can be seen napping in bright sunlight.\nThere is a seed on its back. By soaking up the sun’s rays,\nthe seed grows progressively larger.
There is a bud on this Pokémon’s back. To support its weight,\nIvysaur’s legs and trunk grow thick and strong.\nIf it starts spending more time lying in the sunlight,\nit’s a sign that the bud will bloom into a large flower soon.
There is a large flower on Venusaur’s back. The flower is said\nto take on vivid colors if it gets plenty of nutrition and sunlight.\nThe flower’s aroma soothes the emotions of people.
The flame that burns at the tip of its tail is an indication\nof its emotions. The flame wavers when Charmander\nis enjoying itself. If the Pokémon becomes enraged,\nthe flame burns fiercely.
Charmeleon mercilessly destroys its foes using its sharp\nclaws. If it encounters a strong foe, it turns aggressive.\nIn this excited state, the flame at the tip of its tail flares with\na bluish white color.
Charizard flies around the sky in search of powerful opponents.\nIt breathes fire of such great heat that it melts anything.\nHowever, it never turns its fiery breath on any opponent\nweaker than itself.
Squirtle’s shell is not merely used for protection.\nThe shell’s rounded shape and the grooves on its\nsurface help minimize resistance in water,\nenabling this Pokémon to swim at high speeds.
Its tail is large and covered with a rich, thick fur. The tail\nbecomes increasingly deeper in color as Wartortle ages.\nThe scratches on its shell are evidence of this Pokémon’s\ntoughness as a battler.
Blastoise has water spouts that protrude from its shell.\nThe water spouts are very accurate.\nThey can shoot bullets of water with enough accuracy\nto strike empty cans from a distance of over 160 feet.
Caterpie has a voracious appetite. It can devour leaves\nbigger than its body right before your eyes. From its antenna,\nthis Pokémon releases a terrifically strong odor.
The shell covering this Pokémon’s body is as hard as an\niron slab. Metapod does not move very much.\nIt stays still because it is preparing its soft innards for\nevolution inside the hard shell.
Butterfree has a superior ability to search for delicious honey\nfrom flowers. It can even search out, extract, and carry honey\nfrom flowers that are blooming over six miles from its nest.
Weedle has an extremely acute sense of smell. It is capable\nof distinguishing its favorite kinds of leaves from those it\ndislikes just by sniffing with its big red proboscis (nose).
Kakuna remains virtually immobile as it clings to a tree.\nHowever, on the inside, it is extremely busy as it prepares\nfor its coming evolution.\nThis is evident from how hot the shell becomes to the touch.
Beedrill is extremely territorial. No one should ever approach\nits nest—this is for their own safety. If angered, they will attack\nin a furious swarm.

Smart enough to use tools in battle, these\nPokémon have been seen picking up rocks and\nflinging them or using ropes to wrap up enemies.

It secretly marks potential targets with a scent.\nBy following the scent, it stalks its targets\nand steals from them when they least expect it.
It anchors itself in the ground with its single leg,\nthen basks in the sun. After absorbing enough\nsunlight, its petals spread as it blooms brilliantly.
The seeds attached to its cotton fluff are full of\nnutrients. It spreads them on the wind so that\nplants and other Pokémon can benefit from them.
Its curly fleece is such an effective cushion that\nthis Pokémon could fall off a cliff and stand right\nback up at the bottom, unharmed.

It’s usually peaceful, but the vandalism of mines\nenrages it. Offenders will be incinerated with\nflames that reach 2,700 degrees Fahrenheit.
It spends its entire life inside an apple. It hides\nfrom its natural enemies, bird Pokémon, by\npretending it’s just an apple and nothing more.

As it digs, it swallows sand and stores it in its\nneck pouch. The pouch can hold more than\n17 pounds of sand.

It’s so strong that it can knock out some\nopponents in a single hit, but it also may\nforget what it’s battling midfight.
If it sees any movement around it, this Pokémon\ncharges for it straightaway, leading with its\nsharply pointed jaw. It’s very proud of that jaw.
This Pokémon has a jaw that’s as sharp as a spear\nand as strong as steel. Apparently Barraskewda’s\nflesh is surprisingly tasty, too.
It stores poison in an internal poison sac and\nsecretes that poison through its skin. If you touch\nthis Pokémon, a tingling sensation follows.

This species lives in antique teapots.\nMost pots are forgeries, but on rare occasions,\nan authentic work is found.

It emits psychic power strong enough to cause\nheadaches as a deterrent to the approach\nof others.
Through its nose, it sucks in the emanations\nproduced by people and Pokémon when they\nfeel annoyed. It thrives off this negative energy.
When it gets down on all fours as if to beg for\nforgiveness, it’s trying to lure opponents in so\nthat it can stab them with its spear-like hair.

In ancient times, it was unbeatable thanks to its\npowerful lower body, but it went extinct anyway\nafter it depleted all its plant-based food sources.
The shaking of its freezing upper half is what\ngenerates its electricity. It has a hard time\nwalking around.
Powerful legs and jaws made it the apex predator\nof its time. Its own overhunting of its prey was\nwhat drove it to extinction.
Though it’s able to capture prey by freezing its\nsurroundings, it has trouble eating the prey\nafterward because its mouth is on top of its head.
Its body resembles polished metal, and it’s both\nlightweight and strong. The only drawback is that\nit rusts easily.

A bizarre Pokémon with but a single eye embedded in an iron\nsphere. I suspect this creature levitates due to the magnetism it\nemits from its arms, which resemble horseshoe-shaped magnets.
Three Magnemite gathered to evolve into this Pokémon.\nThe source of much vexation on my part, as its powerful\nmagnetism destroys my research equipment.









Gaseous and completely impalpable. Also highly dangerous—\ninhaling part of its poisonous body will cause one to\nfaint instantly.
This frightful, malevolent spirit can glide through walls,\nappearing wherever it likes. According to rumor, victims of\na Haunter’s lick will wither to death day by day.
Possesses potential victims’ shadows in an effort to steal away\nthe victims’ lives. If your shadow begins to laugh, you must take\nhold of a protective charm posthaste!
This chain of immense stones resembles a giant serpent. Tremors\nshake the earth above as it burrows deep beneath the ground,\nfeeding on boulders as it goes.












Wields its long tongue deftly, as though it were an arm.\nThe Pokémon’s viscous saliva, once it has been collected and\nboiled down, yields a strong and highly useful adhesive.


Ludicrously strong—when it butts heads with a mountain, it is\nthe mountain that shatters. But its short legs struggle with turns,\nand it is incapable of stopping unless it collides with something.
Rapidly rotates its horn to bore through bedrock. It swaggers\naround volcanic regions, protected from the lava’s heat by its\ntough, armorlike hide.
This purehearted Pokémon shares its eggs with the injured.\nThese eggs are so nutritious that they’ve been nicknamed\n“doctors’ doubles.”
It is cloaked entirely in blue vines, preventing any glimpse of\nits true identity. The vines impart a refreshing sensation when\nchewed—they’re useful as a spice.







The behavior of this clown-like Pokémon reminds one of\npantomime. It creates invisible walls using a force emitted\nfrom its fingertips.
The large, wickedly sharp scythes on its forearms are truly\nfearsome weapons. Prey’s attempts to flee are unfailingly\nthwarted by this Pokémon’s nimble motions.

Feeds on electrical energy. During sudden showers beneath\nlooming thunderclouds, one can observe Electabuzz scaling tall\ntrees, where the Pokémon will then wait for lightning to strike.
Legend has it that this Pokémon was born from the crater of a\nvolcano. When wounded, it bathes in lava to heal its body, much\nas one would soak in a hot spring.


A feeble, pitiful imbecile of a Pokémon that is nonetheless very\nhardy. Unperturbed by turbid water, it can be found living in all\nsorts of places.
I suspect this Pokémon to be the true identity of a dragon\nwritten of in ancient texts, which claimed that it razed an entire\nvillage with white-hot beams from its maw.


Harbors the potential to evolve into manifold forms.\nWithin Eevee lies the key to the mysteries of Pokémon\nevolution—I’m certain of it.
Tests show that its cells closely resemble water molecules, which\nperhaps explains its ability to conceal its form while submerged.\nI believe the origins of mermaid folklore lie with this Pokémon.
Bristles its fur into sharp, needlelike points when enraged.\nOne can hear electricity crackle in its breath when it exhales.
Flames burn within a saclike organ inside this Pokémon.\nWhen Flareon inhales, these flames grow in intensity, reaching\na mighty 3,000 degrees Fahrenheit.
It has no discernible heartbeat and does not seem to draw\nbreath, and yet it appears to function without issue. I cannot\neven begin to explain this utterly bizarre anomaly.





This glutton appears in villages without warning and devours the\nentirety of their rice granaries—such occurrences have long been\ncounted among the gravest of disasters.











Hails from the Johto region. Though usually curled into a ball\ndue to its timid disposition, it harbors tremendous firepower.
This creature’s fur is most mysterious—it is wholly impervious to\nthe burning touch of flame. Should Quilava turn its back to you,\ntake heed! Such a posture indicates a forthcoming attack.












Its hind limbs have become another set of wings. Crobat\nexpertly maneuvers its four wings to dart in exquisite fashion\nthrough even the most confined caves without losing any speed.


Pichu stores electricity in the sacs on its cheeks but discharges it\ninadvertently when agitated or excited. Being yet immature,\nthe Pokémon’s handling of electricity is rather inept.
In silhouette, they resemble twinkling starlight. When shooting\nstars rain from the night sky, Cleffa gather in numbers and dance\nas though they are indeed incarnations of the stars.

This ovate creature is frequently mistaken for a moving egg\nwhen encountered out in the fields or in the mountains.\nIts guileless smile soothes the soul.
No records exist of Togetic being seen in the wilds. Rumors\nabound that it evolves under the loving care of a trusted human\ncompanion, upon whom the Pokémon then bestows great joy.








Though it pretends to be a tree, it fails to fool even children.\nTo the touch, its body feels more like rock than tree bark.\nSudowoodo’s extreme aversion to water merits special note.




This treetop dweller possesses a tail as dexterous as a hand.\nAncient writings describe this Pokémon as a one-armed oddity.


Its frail wings are so thin that one can see clear through them.\nHowever, during flight these wings exhibit the power to churn\nair with force enough to launch a house skyward.


Wields an arcane power with which it can predict the weather\nand even people’s thoughts. When bathed in sunshine, the\nscarlet orb on its brow glows and builds energy.
It is most active in the wee hours of the night, when moonlight\nbathes the land. Its large eyes can pierce the darkness and\nperceive prey with absolute clarity.
Widely shunned as a bearer of ill fortune. Upon crossing paths\nwith this creature, I’ve been told one must chant “Workrum,\nWorkrum—bad luck, don’t come” as a protective incantation.

It conceals itself in darkness, sending chills up travelers’ spines\nwith its childlike weeping. As it observes the frightened travelers\nwith glee, the red orbs upon its chest let off an eerie light.
It is hard to believe these strangely shaped Pokémon are truly\nliving creatures. I’ve pointed out that the species’ many forms\nresemble writing from other lands; no one will take me seriously.





Its tail is tipped by a thick, horrible stinger. To bring down prey,\nit will first obscure their vision by covering their faces with its\nbody, and then it will use the stinger to inject them with venom.
This Pokémon evolved through use of a strange item. Its body is\ncoated with steel powder and notably hard—not even diamond\ncan leave so much as a scratch.



Evolved by way of a curious item. The shell covering its body\nhas been shown to be stronger than forged steel.

This Pokémon has an unparalleled horn. Heracross itself\ndemonstrates tremendous power—it’s capable of throwing\nseveral people trained in the traditional arts of war at once.
This Pokémon shares roots with the Sneasel of Hisui, but unlike\nthat species, this one is spiteful in personality. I hypothesize\nthat water and earth can affect Sneasel’s mind and body.
It licks its paws because of the sweet honey that has soaked into\nthem. It is cunning, stealing into the nests of Combee and taking\nfor itself the honey that the Combee have amassed.
When the cold season arrives in Hisui, this Pokémon will wander\nfields and mountains alike in search of its favorite berries.\nUrsaring’s hunger during this time makes it a ferocious danger.


Swinub excels at sniffing out mushrooms buried beneath grass or\nsnow. Since ancient times, the people of Hisui have often relied\nupon this skill.
The long fur of this Pokémon covers its eyes, ears, and even\nlimbs, allowing Piloswine to resist harshly frigid conditions.\nThe Pokémon’s white tusks can be used to defeat its enemies.

Spits water from its mouth with incredible accuracy. It captures\nBurmy by shooting them down off the branches from which\nthey dangle.
While Octillery still shoots water from its mouth, the drastic\nanatomical difference between it and Remoraid meant that for\na long time, no one believed the former evolved from the latter.

This calm and gentle Pokémon swims gracefully through the sea.\nAfter building speed, it can leap out of the water. It is often\nmisidentified as a bird Pokémon due to this behavior.






A bizarre item caused this Pokémon to evolve. While it now\nexhibits many new gestures and expressions, its biology\nremains inscrutable.
Its strangely shaped antlers have the power to bewitch those\nwho see them. Medicine made by grinding up the black orbs\nfrom fallen antlers is an effective treatment for insomnia.




They generate electricity by spinning their arms. During a\nthunderstorm, if one hears the lively voices of children out in the\nwilderness, what one is actually hearing are the voices of Elekid.
This Pokémon lives in volcanic areas. With each breath, sparks\nspurt from its mouth and nose. When Magby is in good health,\nits flames gain a yellow tint.

A kindhearted Pokémon that will care for any sick person or\nPokémon until their health improves. The eggs it lays are\ndelicious and bring good fortune to those who eat them.






















Likes sap and is abundant in the wild. Why it evolves into\nvarious different forms is unknown. One cannot tell from a\nWurmple’s appearance which form it will take when it evolves.
Wraps itself in thin strings of silk while it stores energy for\nevolution. It can’t extend its limbs and its movement is slow,\nbut its eyes keep a sharp lookout—Silcoon is always on guard.
A colorful and incredibly beautiful but also greedy Pokémon.\nIn an effort to keep its favorite food all to itself, it will chase\naway Combee as they try to gather nectar.
The silk coating its body is thin but sufficiently strong. Cascoon’s\nsilk has a luster and texture superior to that of Silcoon’s, and\nclothes made using Cascoon silk are regarded as top-notch.
Tends to be drawn to bonfires on dark nights. Difficult to chase\naway from settlements because of the way it scatters highly\ntoxic scales.










Tends to prefer people with a chipper disposition to those who\nare gloomy, but it has shown no discrimination with regard to\nage or gender. Needs more research.
It resembles a maiden in appearance, but it wields strange\npowers to project visions of paradise. I suspect the crimson\nornaments on its head are the key to its abilities.
It will dedicate itself to defending a master it has come to\nadore. Its pure white dress, reminiscent of those worn by ladies\nof nobility, is the dress of one who is willing to risk their life.
















Once the people of Hisui discovered that its red nose always\npoints north, they grew to rely on it greatly when traveling afar.\nThe nose seems to work in a similar way to ancient compasses.















Though beautiful, it has highly poisonous thorns. There is an old\ntradition in my homeland wherein one would send these thorns\nto an opponent to challenge them to a duel.























Makes its home in swamps with murky water. The poor visibility\nhides this Pokémon from predators, and the slime on its body\nmakes grasping it difficult.
Strikes its caudal fin against the swamp bed to shake the ground\nand startle its prey. It will then swallow the fleeing prey whole.\nPeople mistook this behavior as the cause of earthquakes.














I’ve heard that the children of Hisui all begin to behave once\nthey’ve been told the story of how this Pokémon roams about\nbefore the witching hour to spirit away misbehaving children.
There are rumors that peeking inside its bandage-wrapped body\nwill cause one to get pulled in through the gaps between the\nbandages, never to return. I’ve been too scared to verify.

Can emit waves of air powerful enough to knock out prey taller\nthan itself. I hypothesize that it amplifies the faint sound of wind\nwithin its body.


Arrives alongside the first snow. It’s thought that homes Snorunt\nvisit will prosper for many generations. By tradition, one might\noffer a lump of ice made from pure water at one’s front door.
It covers its body with an armor of ice harder than steel. Uses its\nbreath to freeze prey, which it then devours as if they were\nfrozen desserts.
During the season when drift ice approaches the shore, Spheal\nprefers living on the ice—where fewer predators lurk—rather\nthan the land. Its fur retains heat superbly and resists harsh cold.
Its white whiskers are very sensitive. Sealeo will balance Spheal\non the tip of its nose, checking its scent and its feel to be sure\nthe Spheal is healthy.
Its thick tusks are strong enough to shatter drift ice. They have\nbeen known to break, but they will grow back by the next year.\nThe Hisui region is well known for these broken tusks.





















This Pokémon becomes more energetic the more sunlight there\nis. The part resembling a shell is similar to silt and is slightly\ndamp and warm to the touch.
Appears where there is clean spring water. The fruit that grows\non the shrubs on its shell is sweet, nutritious, and truly delicious.
This remarkable, large-bodied Pokémon would serve beautifully\nas borrowed scenery for a garden, and its strength is peerless.\nTorterra roams the wilderness in search of clean water.
Full of vigor and always in high spirits. It was once known by the\nname “Lantern-Tail” and feared as some kind of apparition.
The deeper the blue on its face, the more powerful it will grow\nto become. It leaps about every which way and lands powerful\nblows against its opponents with the flame on its tail.
A tall, hardy Pokémon with a dazzling appearance. It shrouds\nitself in flame and battles as if engaged in dance—truly a sight\nto behold.
Prefers cold climes and appears along coasts. It’s an adorable\nlittle thing—as cute as any child—but it’s also prideful, unwilling\nto accept handouts from people.
It swims gracefully through the frigid sea and sings with a voice\nlike the roaring tide. It has powerful, sturdy wings and dignity\nto match.
Since ancient times, it has been revered by the people of Hisui,\nwho call it the Master of the Waves. Its wings are a match for\neven master-crafted blades.
They live in the fields and mountains, gathering in large flocks.\nTheir cries are quite obnoxious. Though small, their wings are\nstrong—a strike from them leaves pain that persists for a week.
They form remarkably large flocks and are constantly fighting\namongst themselves. I suspect that those with magnificent\nplumes on their heads are the strong ones.
It has left the flock, having gained strength enough to survive on\nits own. The astounding force with which Staraptor flies through\nthe air allows it to carry away large, burly targets.
Bidoof has an unsophisticated face and is rarely flustered by\nanything. There have been incidents involving Bidoof sauntering\ninto villages and gnawing on the houses without a single care.
Bibarel fur repels water and is also a fantastic material for heat\nretention. These Pokémon create dams on rivers to live in.
When the trees take on new hues, more of these Pokémon\nappear. The tone they create by striking their antennae together\nresembles that of the marimba, an instrument of foreign lands.
It uses its cutlass-like arms to produce sound, the melody of\nwhich varies from individual to individual. It is a worthwhile\nendeavor to seek out one’s favorite tunes.
Shakes its body to generate electricity. Its stature belies its\naggression—one must be patient to tame this Pokémon.
Proudly uses its electrified claws as weapons. It seems to be a\ngracious Pokémon, evenly sharing the spoils of the hunt with\nothers of its kind.
They form packs, each having one male as leader. Legends say\nthat when Luxray’s two eyes shimmer with gold, the Pokémon\ncan see through anything.
When the sun’s light strengthens, the bud atop this Pokémon’s\nhead opens. This is a sign to the people that the harsh winter is\nover, and the season of budding has begun.
Hidden within the bouquet on each hand are thorned whips\nloaded with virulent poison. Roserade moves gracefully as it\ncorners its prey and mercilessly lashes them with its whips.
An incredibly rare sight. They duel each other by ramming their\nheads together, and the resulting sound echoes throughout the\narea like the pealing of a bell.
Very little is known about its biology. Can knock down massive\ntrees by smashing its beautiful, pearl-like crown against them.
Much remains unknown about this Pokémon, as few have ever\nseen it. However, we know that it is calm and dislikes conflict,\nand it enjoys polishing its face against trees and rocks.
Its face is sturdy—as strong as diamond—and this hardness\noffers a very stable defense. Much about this species is still\nunknown, such as its natural habitat.
If its cloak is even slightly damaged, Burmy will immediately\nrepair it with whatever is close at hand. The Pokémon within the\ncloak is scrawny and vulnerable to the cold.
The cloak—fashioned from plant matter—has merged with the\nPokémon and is now part of the body, like fur or skin. I suspect\nthis fusion is an effect of the energy involved in evolution.
Scatters steel-colored scales as it flaps its wings. Despite\nbeing observed feeding primarily on the nectar of flowers,\nMothim is not often seen around flower gardens.
They swear fealty to a queen Pokémon and work diligently to\ngather nectar. Each swarm produces a different flavor of honey.
Commands its subjects to build its hive. It will dispatch any\ninterlopers who dare sneak into its nest and use them as\nnourishment for itself.
A species related to the Pikachu line. Though Pachirisu is a calm\nPokémon, it still presents a danger should one touch its\nelectrified tail or cheeks.
It moves freely in the water by spinning its forked tail for\npropulsion. The resemblance to the screw of a steamboat\nis coincidental.
Has a long, rather splendid flotation sac, which prevents\nFloatzel from drowning even in stormy seas. One might glimpse\nthis species around fishing hamlets from time to time.
Once the fruit growing alongside the main body is large and\nplump, Cherubi will use the nutrients within to evolve. The fruit\nthen detaches, becoming nourishment for other creatures.
Motionless, save for the occasional quiver. A rich array of\nPokémon can be found gathered around it, drawn by the\nscent exuded from Cherrim’s folded petals.
Found in abundance on seashores bordering warm waters.\nShellos are unexpectedly friendly and will crawl toward any\nperson they see. Take care not to get coated in mucus!
Eats beach sand for nourishment. Should one Gastrodon\nencounter another of a different color, a fierce battle will\ninevitably ensue.
To affirm their kinship, members of this species will form a ring\nby linking their newly doubled tails together. On rare occasions,\nhumans have been accepted into such rings.
Said to lure away young children and carry them off to the\nafterlife. Some whisper that Drifloon are formed of reincarnated\nhuman souls, but these rumors are as yet unconfirmed.
It drifts along at dusk, perfectly silent. Its transient, melancholy\naspect touches some people deeply—every so often, one will\ncome upon a song or poem devoted to Drifblim.
My hypothesis as to why Buneary rolls up its ears is that its\nhearing is far too keen. I surmise that the Pokémon protects its\nhearing by limiting the sound that may enter its ears.
Its fur is warm and yet remarkably light. This Pokémon kicks as\nthough it were a master of karate, driving back its opponents\nwith ease.
The incantations Mismagius chants can ward against misfortune,\nso a custom exists of inviting it into one’s home. Incur the\nPokémon’s displeasure, however, and disaster will surely ensue.
One cry from this Pokémon, and a murder of Murkrow come\nflying. At such times, one would think the curtain of night had\nfallen, plunging the world into jet-black darkness.
Bewitches humans with its helical tail and piercing gaze.\nIts hidden claws are quite sharp as well, making this Pokémon\nan exceedingly tricky opponent if antagonized.
Though impudent and difficult to tame, Purugly enjoys great\npopularity due to its fur, the beauty of which surpasses\neven velveteen.
This Pokémon gave me an excruciating headache when it\nseemingly cried out without making a sound. Perhaps there are\nsome sounds that the human ear is simply incapable of hearing.
The poison that gushes from its aft end is accompanied by an\nutterly evil-smelling odor with such potency that one whiff can\ninduce memory loss.
Sprays a poisonous fluid to take down prey. Sometimes, unable\nto stomach the stench of its own fluid, it leaves the bested\nprey uneaten.
Floats using a mysterious energy. The pattern engraved upon its\nback is held as sacred and can sometimes be found in imagery\nfrom ancient cemeteries and other such timeworn places.
Some believe that its bell-like cry opens holes to another world.\nIt has been revered as a deity since ancient times.
Its tears elicit sympathy from those who see them, but do\nnot be deceived! This expulsion of body water is merely a\nphysiological mechanism for keeping itself in good health.
Known to turn up in bustling marketplaces now and again.\nIt mimics people much as a child would, then watches how they\nreact, eyes sparkling.
In imitation of Chansey, it keeps a round stone tucked into its\nbelly pouch and cherishes it dearly. It gets along well with\nchildren and will sometimes play house with them for fun.
A versatile performer skilled in the imitation of human speech.\nIt is said that older, more experienced Chatot can even\nunderstand the meaning of the words they mimic.
It lays curses by thinking wicked thoughts. Writings tell that this\nPokémon was born out of the assembly of five score and eight\nmalevolent spirits.
It nests in caves untouched by sunlight. Its sharp teeth may fall\nout when worn away or after an impact, but they regrow within\na few days.
Though Gabite are usually of a violent disposition, when I gave\none a glass bead it had been eyeing covetously, it suddenly\nbecame quite docile.
Soars across the heavens at blinding speed—a magnificent sight!\nIt has a feral disposition. Utmost caution is required if one\nmeets a Garchomp out in the wilds.
Its robust stomach allows it to nonchalantly devour even rotted\nmatter. It pays frequent visits to villages, seeking out food\nscraps intended for compost.
Though infantile in appearance, it has the mysterious ability to\nread the minds of humans. The pure of heart are met with\nRiolu’s approval, while those of ill nature earn only its loathing.
A most gallant-looking creature. It emits energy waves and\ncontrols them with precision, using them to sense even faraway\nbeings. I have given the name “aura” to this power.
Though large and languid, Hippopotas is difficult to detect\ndue to its tendency to burrow into and lurk beneath the soil.\nWhen agitated or excited, it expels sand from its nostrils.
Short-tempered and easily moved to violence. It whips up\nwhirlwinds of sand to crush its foes’ spirits, then goes in for\nthe attack.
Its claws are not only razor-sharp but poisonous, making Skorupi\na highly dangerous Pokémon. It seems to be weakened by cold\ntemperatures, however.
Has a brutish, ferocious temperament. With immense strength\nand a sturdy shell off which swords will bounce, it rampages\nabout and wreaks havoc.
A poison wielder with a dastardly personality. Despite such\nqualities, this species is afforded a measure of popularity due\nto its peculiar cry and comical features.
Its crimson claws contain a virulent toxin. This toxin can be made\ninto a tonic by diluting it, mixing it with several types of wild\ngrass, and boiling it down over two days.
Though this is a plant Pokémon, it has a gluttonous and unruly\ntemperament. Carnivine attacks its prey with its cavernous maw\nwide open.
What a gorgeous sight this Pokémon is as it swims with its long,\npink-painted caudal fins fluttering behind it. Finneon’s beautiful\nappearance has led to its nickname: “finery fish.”
Uses its gleaming fins to hunt its prey. The view of Lumineon\nschooling near the surface of the sea at night is breathtaking—\nit’s as though there were shining stars right there.
Though ball-like in shape, this Pokémon is a proficient swimmer.\nI have discovered that if a Mantyke spends much time with\nschools of Remoraid, it will eventually achieve evolution.
One is likely to encounter this Pokémon while out in the snow.\nThere are stories of Snover appearing in human settlements but\ndoing no harm—rather, they bond with the children.
A powerful Pokémon that can split huge boulders with ease.\nDislikes associating with others and chooses to live quietly deep\nwithin the mountains, playing with the snow.
This species corners prey as a pack, under the guidance of\na leader. Weavile displays increased cunning, leading me to\nspeculate that its evolution caused further brain development.
I theorize that a special magnetic field influenced this Pokémon,\nchanging its molecular structure and causing it to evolve. It emits\nstrange radio waves toward space from its antenna.
Its tongue can extend and contract freely, and it is capable of\nreaching lengths over 10 times Lickilicky’s height. Beware of the\nsaliva, as it contains corrosive elements.
This Pokémon evolved through use of a curious item. Its rocklike\nhide is composed of a mysterious substance and can withstand a\nblow from a masterwork sword with nary a scratch.
Draped with long vines, it resembles a shrub in appearance.\nIt swings bundles of vines as though they were arms, wrapping\nthem around prey to ensnare them.
Its evolution was induced by an unusual item, and its electrical\noutput rises along with its heart rate. From its tails, it can\nunleash an electric current measuring 20,000 volts.
Use of a strange item caused this Pokémon to evolve. Fireballs\nlaunched from the ends of its tubelike arms are hot enough to\nmelt an iron pot in an instant.
Scant few have ever sighted this Pokémon. After studying what\nliterature remains, I am certain Togekiss will reveal itself when\npeace reigns in the land.
Extremely violent. When hunting, it wastes none of its energy,\naiming only for prey’s most vulnerable spots. Any who manage\nto tame this Pokémon must be of incredible bravery.
Cells similar to those of plants have been found in its fur.\nIts hard tail can fell a large tree with one stroke, and the tail’s\nsharpness exceeds even that of a sword crafted by a master.
Glaceon is able to lower its body temperature very quickly.\nIt freezes the atmosphere, creating diamond dust that glitters\nlike gems while it flutters and dances around.
It glides soundlessly on pitch-black wings and sinks sharp fangs\ninto the throat of its prey. It takes on a look of satisfaction once\nit has entirely drained its prey of blood.
This species reached its zenith during the period known as the\nice age. I suspect that Hisui’s frigid climate is in harmony with\nMamoswine’s constitution, thus awakening hidden potential.
A curious item induced this evolution. The Pokémon’s offensive\ncapabilities have greatly increased, but the strangeness of its\nbehavior has magnified in equal measure. This worries me.
The blades extending from its elbows are sharper than the\nfinest swords. Its swordsmanship, albeit self-taught, is\nastonishingly impressive.
It is able to emit powerful magnetism, allowing it control over\nthe iron sand that forms its luscious mustache. Using this iron\nsand, Probopass forms hard stones with which it smites its prey.
Comes to those whose lives have come to an end and escorts\ntheir souls to the afterlife. Known to mistakenly take the souls of\nthose who yet have life left in them, albeit rarely.
A Pokémon inhabited by the soul of a woman who died bearing\na grudge in the snowy mountains. Legends of Froslass placing\ndeathly curses on misbehaving men send shivers down my spine.
This bizarre Pokémon appears to be a will-o’-the-wisp powered\nby electricity. Be wary, as Rotom is both smart and mischievous.
A Pokémon feared but also respected for stealing away the\nmemories of evildoers. I have found records that suggest Uxie\nholds dominion over knowledge.
Known as the Being of Emotion. In legend, this Pokémon was\nfeared, as any who showed disrespect would have their\nemotions thrown into disarray.
The dreaded Being of Willpower. Legends tell of this Pokémon\nmanipulating the will of its adversaries and turning them into\npuppets of its own.
This Pokémon is revered as a deity in Hisuian legend. The birth\nof Dialga was what caused the vast river of time to begin\nflowing in our world.
This Pokémon is feared as a deity in Hisuian legend. The birth\nof Palkia was what caused the walls of our world to disappear,\ncreating a sky that spans for infinity.
Stories tell of this Pokémon being birthed from the boiling\nmagma within Mount Coronet. Its molten-steel body holds\nmany mysteries.
According to legend, Regigigas pulled landmasses together and\nbound them with rope to create the continent of Hisui. Though I\nhave my doubts, the story could well contain a shred of truth.
There is one Hisuian verse that tells of a powerful light creating\na deep shadow. I imagine that this deep shadow is Giratina.
Cresselia is reminiscent of the crescent moon. It leaves a brilliant\nline of light in its wake as it flies across the night sky. I daresay\nit resembles the heavenly maiden who created the Milky Way.
Can be seen floating offshore during seasons when the seas are\nwarm. Its azure body blends in with the ocean waters—logic\nsuggests this is a defense mechanism against natural predators.
Rumored to migrate across the oceans and visit Hisui’s coastal\nwaters only rarely. Although Manaphy resembles Phione, it is\nalso quite different. The relation between the two is unclear.
On a moonless night, a strange incident occurred in which every\none of a village’s inhabitants suffered nightmares. The villagers\nattested that Darkrai appeared before them in these nightmares.
When the turning of seasons brings the cruel winter to its end\nand the joyous people give thanks to the heavens, Shaymin\nappears and covers the withered land with flowers.
It is the heavenly fount from which pours the light that shines\nacross Hisui. Its luminance guides and protects all Pokémon.\nHisuian mythology states that Arceus is the creator of all things.







This Pokémon from the Unova region uses the shell on its belly\nas a weapon to cut down its foes. Thus, I’ve conferred upon this\nshell the name “scalchop.”
Its exquisite double-scalchop technique is likely the result of\ndaily training, and it can send even masters of the blade fleeing\nin defeat.













































The leaves on its head are highly valued for medicinal purposes.\nDry the leaves in the sun, boil them, and then drink the bitter\ndecoction for remarkably effective relief from fatigue.














































































Its chick-like looks belie its hotheadedness. It challenges its\nparents at every opportunity, desperate to prove its strength.













This storm-stirring Pokémon is said to cause the seasons to\nturn by whipping up the air. I suspect its humanlike form to be\na false one.
They say this wielder of electricity has waged war with its\nnemesis, Tornadus, since time immemorial. The lightning bolts\nit hurls pierce the very earth and enrich the soil.


When the incarnations of wind and of lightning clash, Landorus\narrives to quell the conflict. After the tempests and thunderbolts\nabate, the land is sure to be blessed with bountiful harvests.






















































It emits a soothing aura from its ribbon-shaped organs. It wraps\nthese appendages around quarrelers to instantly restore calm to\nthe situation.



Goomy hides away in the shade of trees, where it’s nice and\nhumid. If the slime coating its body dries out, the Pokémon\ninstantly becomes lethargic.







Lives on mountains blanketed in perennial snow. It freezes water\nvapor in the air to make the ice helmet that it dons for defense.









Flies noiselessly on delicate wings. It has mastered the art of\ndeftly launching dagger-sharp feathers from those same wings.
Regularly basks in sunlight to gather power—presumably due to\nthe frigid climate. Nonetheless, the edges of the blade quills set\ninto its wings are keen as ever.







































































































































































The black orbs shine with an uncanny light when the Pokémon is\nerecting invisible barriers. The fur shed from its beard retains\nheat well and is a highly useful material for winter clothing.
A violent creature that fells towering trees with its crude axes\nand shields itself with hard stone. If one should chance upon\nthis Pokémon in the wilds, one’s only recourse is to flee.
I believe it was Hisui’s swampy terrain that gave Ursaluna its\nburly physique and newfound capacity to manipulate peat\nat will.
Clads itself in the souls of comrades that perished before\nfulfilling their goals of journeying upstream. No other species\nthroughout all Hisui’s rivers is Basculegion’s equal.
Because of Sneasler’s virulent poison and daunting physical\nprowess, no other species could hope to best it on the frozen\nhighlands. Preferring solitude, this species does not form packs.
Its lancelike spikes and savage temperament have earned it the\nnickname “sea fiend.” It slurps up poison to nourish itself.
When it flies to this land from across the sea, the bitter winter\ncomes to an end. According to legend, this Pokémon’s love\ngives rise to the budding of fresh life across Hisui.























These Pokémon live in packs in the snowy mountains and defend\nthemselves with icy breath. I suspect this species changed its\nform to adapt to the frigid climate.
Dwells on sacred peaks perpetually covered in snow. Said to\nappear to virtuous people who have lost their way on mountain\npaths—it then guides them back down to the mountain’s base.






They patrol their territory in pairs. I believe the igneous\nrock components in the fur of this species are the result of\nvolcanic activity in its habitat.
Snaps at its foes with fangs cloaked in blazing flame. Despite its\nbulk, it deftly feints every which way, leading opponents on a\ndeceptively merry chase as it all but dances around them.















An enigmatic Pokémon that happens to bear a resemblance to a\nPoké Ball. When excited, it discharges the electric current it has\nstored in its belly, then lets out a great, uproarious laugh.
The tissue on the surface of its body is curiously similar in\ncomposition to an Apricorn. When irritated, this Pokémon lets\nloose an electric current equal to 20 lightning bolts.
















Said to purify lost, forsaken souls with its flames and guide them\nto the afterlife. I believe its form has been influenced by the\nenergy of the sacred mountain towering at Hisui’s center.

It is hard to believe these strangely shaped Pokémon are truly\nliving creatures. I’ve pointed out that the species’ many forms\nresemble writing from other lands; no one will take me seriously.

Fishers detest this troublesome Pokémon because it sprays\npoison from its spines, getting it everywhere. A different form\nof Qwilfish lives in other regions.


Its sturdy, curved claws are ideal for traversing precipitous cliffs.\nFrom the tips of these claws drips a venom that infiltrates the\nnerves of any prey caught in Sneasel’s grasp.

































It creates a cloak by weaving together sand, mud, and silk it\nhas spat out. This earthen cloak is ruined by wind and rain,\nso the Pokémon hides away in caves and other such places.
When confronted by a lack of other materials, Burmy will create\nits cloak using dust and refuse. The cloak seems to be more\ncomfortable than one would think.
Its earthen skin is reasonably hard—it has no problem repelling\na Starly’s pecking, at least.
Its body, composed of refuse, blends in to the scenery so much\nas to be inconspicuous. This seems to be the perfect way for the\nPokémon to evade the detection of predators.


Cheerfully active on sunny days. Immediately closes its petals\nand becomes immobile once the sun becomes hidden, however.
Found in abundance on seashores bordering cold waters.\nWhen pressed upon, the Pokémon will secrete from its body’s\nsurface a purple fluid that will stain one’s clothes.
Found more often on the land than in the sea. More active\nwhen it’s cloudy or rainy out than when the weather is fair.





A form in which Rotom lurks within a strange cauldron.\nThe cauldron’s origin is unknown. A bothersome Pokémon,\ncausing trouble with the flames it spits.

A form in which Rotom lurks within a mysterious contraption.\nThe contraption’s purpose is unknown. A bothersome Pokémon,\ncausing trouble by stirring up powerful winds.
A form in which Rotom lurks within a misshapen wheelbarrow.\nThe wheelbarrow’s mechanisms are bizarre. It’s a bothersome\nPokémon, causing trouble by mowing down grass and trees.
Radiant light caused Dialga to take on a form bearing a striking\nresemblance to the creator Pokémon. Dialga now wields such\ncolossal strength that one must conclude this is its true form.
It soars across the sky in a form that greatly resembles the\ncreator of all things. Perhaps this imitation of appearance is\nPalkia’s strategy for gaining Arceus’s powers.
Giratina loses its legs upon changing into this form. I believe this\nPokémon must hail from a world where the heavens and the\nearth are as one, though I have no way of proving it.
Upon taking in the scent of a particular rare flower, Shaymin is\nenveloped in light, and its tiny body transforms. I took a whiff\nof the flower myself, but alas, my body remained unchanged.
It is the heavenly fount from which pours the light that shines\nacross Hisui. Its luminance guides and protects all Pokémon.\nHisuian mythology states that Arceus is the creator of all things.

Hard of heart and deft of blade, this rare form of Samurott is\na product of the Pokémon’s evolution in the region of Hisui. Its\nturbulent blows crash into foes like ceaseless pounding waves.


I suspect that its well-developed legs are the result of a life\nspent on mountains covered in deep snow. The scent it exudes\nfrom its flower crown heartens those in proximity.


Though it differs from other Basculin in several respects,\nincluding demeanor—this one is gentle—I have categorized\nit as a regional form given the vast array of shared qualities.






A once-departed soul, returned to life in Hisui. Derives power\nfrom resentment, which rises as energy atop its head and takes\non the forms of foes. In this way, Zorua vents lingering malice.
With its disheveled white fur, it looks like an embodiment of\ndeath. Heedless of its own safety, Zoroark attacks its nemeses\nwith a bitter energy so intense, it lacerates Zoroark’s own body.









Screaming a bloodcurdling battle cry, this huge and ferocious\nbird Pokémon goes out on the hunt. It blasts lakes with shock\nwaves, then scoops up any prey that float to the water’s surface.
An example of what is known as a “form change,” though I\nsuspect this strange avian guise to be Tornadus’s true form.\nTornadus has been sighted crossing the ocean while in this form.
Quick as a flash, it materializes out of nowhere. It pulverizes\nfoes into nothingness with showers of devastatingly powerful\nlightning bolts launched from the string of orbs on its tail.
Landorus soars through the sky in this form, bestowing plentiful\nharvests upon the land and earning the people’s reverence.\nIt can traverse the whole of Hisui in a mere couple of hours.



























































































A creature given to melancholy. I suspect its metallic shell\ndeveloped as a result of the mucus on its skin reacting with\nthe iron in Hisui’s water.
Able to freely control the hardness of its metallic shell.\nIt loathes solitude and is extremely clingy—it will fume and\nrun riot if those dearest to it ever leave its side.






The armor of ice covering its lower jaw puts steel to shame and\ncan shatter rocks with ease. This Pokémon barrels along steep\nmountain paths, cleaving through the deep snow.








The air stored inside the rachises of Decidueye’s feathers\ninsulates the Pokémon against Hisui’s extreme cold. This is\nfirm proof that evolution can be influenced by environment.
























































































Clads itself in the souls of comrades that perished before\nfulfilling their goals of journeying upstream. No other species\nthroughout all Hisui’s rivers is Basculegion’s equal.
A different guise from its feminine humanoid form. From the\nclouds, it descends upon those who treat any form of life with\ndisrespect and metes out wrathful, ruthless punishment.
This Pokémon is being investigated in Pokémon Legends: Arceus.\nComplete research tasks to fill in this Pokémon’s entry!

Perhaps because it would like to grow up\nquickly, it has a voracious appetite, eating\na hundred leaves a day.
Its shell is filled with a thick liquid. All of the\ncells throughout its body are being rebuilt in\npreparation for evolution.
Its wings are covered in toxic scales. If it finds\nbird Pokémon going after Caterpie, Butterfree\nsprinkles its scales on them to drive them off.






Its incisors grow continuously throughout its life.\nIf its incisors get too long, this Pokémon\nbecomes unable to eat, and it starves to death.
People say that it fled from its enemies by\nusing its small webbed hind feet to swim\nfrom island to island in Alola.
Its reckless nature leads it to stand up to\nothers—even large Pokémon—if it has to protect\nits territory.
Carrying food through Fearow’s territory is\ndangerous. It will snatch the food away from\nyou in a flash!
By dislocating its jaw, it can swallow prey larger\nthan itself. After a meal, it curls up and rests.
The latest research has determined that there\nare over 20 possible arrangements of the\npatterns on its stomach.
Its nature is to store up electricity. Forests\nwhere nests of Pikachu live are dangerous,\nsince the trees are so often struck by lightning.
As electricity builds up inside its body, it\nbecomes more aggressive. One theory is that\nthe electricity buildup is actually causing stress.
It lives in areas of limited rainfall. When danger\napproaches, it curls up into a ball to protect its\nsoft stomach.
Its claws and horns often break off. The broken\nclaws and horns can be used to carve plows for\ntilling farm fields.






They’re popular, but they’re rare. Trainers who\nshow them off recklessly may be targeted\nby thieves.
It can’t help but hear a pin drop from over half\na mile away, so it lives deep in the mountains\nwhere there aren’t many people or Pokémon.
Its beautiful tails have made it very popular.\nHowever, if it’s not brushed diligently, it will\nbe a mass of tangles before you know it.
It is vindictive and relentless by nature.\nThose who cross it even once will be cursed for\na thousand years, along with their descendants.
Recordings of Jigglypuff’s strange lullabies can\nbe purchased from department stores. These\nCDs can be found near the bedding area.
Thanks to its bouncy body and fine fur,\nthis Pokémon is sought after. Holding one\nin your arms while you sleep feels great.
It has no eyeballs, so it can’t see. It checks its\nsurroundings via the ultrasonic waves it emits\nfrom its mouth.
Every once in a while, you’ll see a Golbat that’s\nmissing some fangs. This happens when hunger\ndrives it to try biting a Steel-type Pokémon.



Whether it’s due to a lack of moisture or a lack\nof nutrients, in Alola the mushrooms on Paras\ndon’t grow up quite right.
The bug is mostly dead, with the mushroom on\nits back having become the main body. If the\nmushroom comes off, the bug stops moving.


It travels through tunnels that it digs\nunderground. It hates sunlight, so it comes\nout only after the sun goes down.
While the three of them normally get along\nsplendidly, on rare occasions a huge fight will\nbreak out over which head gets to eat first.
When visiting a junkyard, you may catch sight\nof it having an intense fight with Murkrow over\nshiny objects.
Although the jewel on its forehead appears to\nbe a different color than those of Alolan\nPersian, it’s mostly made of the same material.
Using psychokinesis gives it a headache, so it\nnormally passes the time spacing out and doing\nas little as possible.
Even fast-swimming fish Pokémon can be\ndisabled by Golduck. It brings them to a\nstandstill and seizes them.
The smallest of things could cause it to lose its\ntemper. Because it doesn’t hold in its stress,\nthis Pokémon can live a long time.
It will never forgive opponents who have\nangered it. Even after it has beaten them down\nuntil they can’t move, it never ever forgives.
While it’s quite friendly toward humans once it’s\ngrown used to them, in the wild it must be quite\nfierce to defend its territory from Rockruff.
Legends tell of its fighting alongside a general\nand conquering a whole country.
Despite the danger, it wants to come up on land.\nSo it does its best to waddle along, but when\nan enemy finds it, it rushes back to the water.
Although it has become capable of living on\nland, it spends its time in the water, where\nits prey, fish Pokémon, are plentiful.
It’s quite a gifted swimmer, even among\nWater-type Pokémon, but it normally spends its\ntime on land.
It uses various psychic powers even while it’s\nsleeping, so you can’t tell whether or not\nit’s awake.
It stares at a silver spoon to amplify its psychic\npowers before it lets loose. Apparently, gold\nspoons are no good.
Alakazam uses its psychic powers to make the\nspoons it carries. Each spoon is an original that\nthere’s only one of in the whole world.
Once this Pokémon has gained enough\nconfidence and muscle from training with its\nfriends, it challenges Makuhita to a battle.
When it encounters an enemy that’s truly\nmighty, this Pokémon removes the power-save\nbelt from its waist and unleashes its full power.
It grasps its opponents with its four arms and\ntwists them up in an intricate hold. People call\nit “the Machamp special.”



It drifts through the sea searching for prey.\nIts poisonous tentacles break off sometimes,\nbut after a while, they grow back.
It fires off ultrasonic waves from its red orbs\nto weaken its prey, and then it wraps them up\nin its 80 tentacles.
Geodude that have lived a long life have had all\ntheir edges smoothed out until they’re totally\nround. They also have a calm, quiet disposition.
It climbs up cliffs as it heads toward the peak\nof a mountain. As soon as it reaches the summit,\nit rolls back down the way it came.
When Golem grow old, they stop shedding their\nshells. Those that have lived a long, long time\nhave shells green with moss.


There are some places where Slowpoke is\nworshiped because of a long-standing belief\nthat whenever Slowpoke yawns, it rains.
Spacing out is basically all it does. It turns back\ninto Slowpoke if its tail, along with Shellder,\nbreaks off.
It’s frequently the cause of power outages,\nwhich is why some power plants send out\nelectrical signals that it can’t stand.
Delicate equipment can malfunction in areas\ninhabited by Magneton, which send out\nmysterious electrical signals.



It has always been supposed that Seel live only\nin cold seas. Their having shown up in Alola is\na mystery.
It swims through the ocean at a speed of eight\nknots, searching for Pokémon that will become\nits prey. It’s especially fond of Wishiwashi.
It was born from sludge on the ocean floor. In a\nsterile environment, the germs within its body\ncan’t multiply, and it dies.
Their food sources have decreased, and their\nnumbers have declined sharply. Sludge ponds\nare being built to prevent their extinction.
The sand that accumulates inside its shell\neventually becomes a pearl. But the pearl gets\nin the way, so it spits it out and discards it.
If areas of Cloyster’s very hard shell get\ndamaged, those areas swell, gradually growing\ninto large sharp spikes.
It’s said that gas emanating from a graveyard\nwas possessed by the grievances of the\ndeceased and thus became a Pokémon.
On moonless nights, Haunter searches for\nsomeone to curse, so it’s best not to go out\nwalking around.
You can hear tales told all over the world about\nhow Gengar will pay a visit to children who\nare naughty.

It can be spotted near recreational facilities,\nintending to eat the pleasant dreams of children\nwho enjoyed themselves there that day.
In Alola, Komala is Hypno’s main target. It rarely\nharms people.




Six of them form a single Pokémon. Should one\nof the six be lost, the next morning there will\nonce more be six.
It engages its enemies using psychic powers.\nEach of its three heads fires off psychokinetic\nenergy, tripling its power.
At night, it weeps loudly for its dead mother,\nbut those cries only attract its natural\nenemy—Mandibuzz.
It throws bones at Mandibuzz to knock it down.\nIt’s thought that Marowak is trying to avenge\nits parent.


It checks out whatever’s around it by licking\neverything. If you don’t clean off a spot where\nit’s licked you, you’ll break out in a rash!




It seems that other Pokémon’s efforts to take\nits delicious, nutritious egg away from it caused\nChansey to get faster at fleeing.

Kangaskhan protects its child by keeping it in\nits pouch. It has zero forgiveness for those\nwho harm its child and will beat them down.


Although known for their splendid tail fins,\nGoldeen apparently compete among themselves\nto see whose horn is thickest and sharpest.
Its horn spins like a drill to steadily hollow out\nrocks—even harder ones. The coloration of the\nmale is more vivid.
In many places, there are folktales of stardust\nfalling into the ocean and becoming Staryu.
Its sparkling core is called “the gem of the sea.”\nThis core can be made into high-priced\naccessories that are traded in secret.
Its pantomime skills are wonderful. You may\nbecome enraptured while watching it, but next\nthing you know, Mr. Mime has made a real wall.
Its two sharp scythes are more than just\nweapons. It uses them with dexterity to dress\nits prey before eating.
It sways its hips to a rhythm all its own. The\nprecise movements of Jynx living in Alola are\ntruly wonderful.
Electricity permeates its body. It swings\nits arms round and round to charge up\nelectricity before unleashing a punch.
Its entire body is burning. When it breathes,\nthe temperature rises. When it sneezes, flames\nshoot out!
It gets into territorial disputes with Vikavolt.\nFor some reason, it apparently gets along well\nwith Heracross in Alola.
They live in groups. The one with the longest,\nthickest, and most-scarred horns is the boss\nof the herd.
In the distant past, they were fairly strong, but\nthey have become gradually weaker over time.
It fires hyper beams in all directions, burning the\nsurrounding area to ash. There are some regions\nwhere it’s called “the deity of destruction.”
It likes swimming around with people on its\nback. In the Alola region, it’s an important means\nof transportation over water.
While it can transform into anything, each Ditto\napparently has its own strengths and\nweaknesses when it comes to transformations.
The question of why only Eevee has such\nunstable genes has still not been solved.
Clean, clear waters are its usual habitat. When\nit’s about to be attacked by an invading enemy,\nit dives into the water to hide.
Its lungs contain an organ that creates\nelectricity. The crackling sound of electricity\ncan be heard when it exhales.
If it inhales deeply, that’s a sign it’s about to\nattack. Prepare to be hit by flames of over\n3,000 degrees Fahrenheit!
This Pokémon was created using the\ncutting-edge science of 20 years ago, so\nmany parts of it have since become obsolete.
Omanyte lived in the seas of antiquity. Its\nfossils have been found bearing bite marks from\nArcheops, so apparently Archeops preyed on it.
Its heavy shell is thought to be the reason this\nancient Pokémon died out. It’s apparently a\ndistant ancestor of Octillery.
This Pokémon thrived 300 million years ago. It’s\nsaid that living specimens can still be seen\nin a certain region—a rare sight.
Its body had begun to change so it could\nfunction on land. But it didn’t adapt in time and\nwent extinct.
Restored from DNA found in amber, this\nPokémon exhibited ferocity that was greater\nthan expected. Some casualties resulted.
It doesn’t do anything other than eat and sleep.\nWhen prompted to make a serious effort,\nthough, it apparently displays awesome power.



It’s still weak, so it lurks on the floor of bodies\nof water, eating whatever food sinks down and\nliving a quiet life.
Lakes where Dragonair live are filled with\nofferings from people, because they believe this\nPokémon is able to control the weather.
It flies over raging seas as if they were nothing.\nObserving this, a ship’s captain dubbed this\nPokémon “the sea incarnate.”













Every day, it tilts its head in the same rhythm.\nA long time ago, people raised these Pokémon\nto serve as clocks.
With eyes that can see in pitch-darkness, it\nnever lets its prey escape. Some even call it\n“the emperor of dark nights.”
This Pokémon is very sensitive to cold. In the\nwarmth of Alola, it appears quite lively.
It’s said that the patterns on its back are\nrelated to the stars in the night sky, but the\ndetails of that relationship remain unclear.
With threads from its mouth, it fashions sturdy\nwebs that won’t break even if you set a rock\non them.
Every night, it wanders around in search of\nprey, whose movements it restrains by spewing\nthreads before it bites into them with its fangs.
Its fangs are so sharp, if it bites you in the dark\nand sucks your blood, you won’t notice any pain\nor realize you’ve been bitten.
Its two antennae glow softly to lure in prey,\nmaking it a useful Pokémon for night fishing.
When the bacteria living inside its antennae\nabsorb Lanturn’s bodily fluids, a strong\nluminescent effect is produced.
It still can’t use electricity well. When it’s\nsurprised or excited, it discharges\nelectricity unintentionally.
On nights with many shooting stars,\nthey gather in packs and dance in circles. If you\nshould see them, something good will happen!
It’s always practicing its singing because it\nwants to improve. Even when it’s asleep,\nit keeps singing in its dreams!


Although it still can’t fly, its jumping power is\noutstanding. It jumps way up into trees and\nplucks the buds from the branches.
It’s said that while this Pokémon has the power\nto predict the future, it’s not powerful enough\nto change the future it sees.
Clothing made from Mareep’s fleece is easily\ncharged with static electricity, so a special\nprocess is used on it.
In the places on its body where fleece doesn’t\ngrow, its skin is rubbery and doesn’t conduct\nelectricity. Those spots are safe to touch.
The light from its tail can be seen from space.\nThis is why you can always tell exactly where it\nis, which is why it usually keeps the light off.



It’s so popular with the elderly that there’s a\nmagazine devoted to this Pokémon. Fans obsess\nover the particular length and angle of its arms.
Although its cries sound like screams, a\ncomposer created a beautiful ballad that was\ninfluenced by the sounds.



As it did more and more with its tail, its hands\nbecame clumsy. It makes its nest high in\nthe treetops.





Although it originally had no powers at all,\npeople say its precognitive faculties were\nawakened by its need to protect itself.
This Pokémon is nocturnal. Even in total\ndarkness, its large eyes can spot its\nprey clearly!
It has a weakness for shiny things. It’s been\nknown to sneak into the nests of Gabite—noted\ncollectors of jewels—in search of treasure.
It’s constantly coming up with new ideas that\nwould change the world, but as soon as it\nhits upon a new idea, it forgets it.
What gives meaning to its life is surprising\nothers. If you set your ear against the red orbs\naround its neck, you can hear shrieking.



Motionless, it hangs from trees, waiting for\nits bug Pokémon prey to come to it. Its favorite\nin Alola is Cutiefly.
When something approaches it, it fires off\nfragments of its steel shell in attack. This is not\na conscious action but a conditioned reflex.
It travels by digging through the ground.\nDiglett and Dunsparce share one another’s\ntunnels happily.


It grows close to others easily and is also easily\nspoiled. The disparity between its face and its\nactions makes many young people wild about it.
While it has powerful jaws, it doesn’t care for\ndisputes, so it rarely has a chance to display\ntheir might.

Its body is like steel. Its tough, heavy pincers\nare more suited to smashing enemies than\ngrabbing them.

It’s proud of its thick horn. In Alola, its biggest\nrival is Vikavolt, which it’s always fighting with.
They will cooperate to steal eggs from the nests\nof bird Pokémon, but fights break out to\ndetermine which one gets to eat the eggs.






The pink of Corsola that live in Alola is deep\nand vibrant, thanks to seas filled with nutrition.
This Pokémon clings to Mantine and shares in\nits prosperity. When its Mantine is attacked,\nRemoraid will fight alongside it!
The ink it spits when escaping is special.\nIt contains a substance that dulls the sense of\nsmell, so Pokémon with keen noses get lost.
It shares its food with people who are stranded.\nBecause Delibird is omnivorous, sometimes\nit gives those people bug Pokémon.
Postcards and posters featuring Mantine\nleaping elegantly above the waves are popular\nsouvenirs of Alola.
The wing feathers it sheds can be processed\nand made into knives whose sharpness is\nrecognized by the finest chefs.
It cooperates with others skillfully. When it\nbecomes your partner, it’s very loyal to you as\nits Trainer and will obey your orders.
They spew flames mixed with poison to finish\noff their opponents. They divvy up their prey\nevenly among the members of their pack.



AI has been installed in it. It learns various\nthings all on its own, but it even remembers\nthings it doesn’t need to know.

The fluid of Smeargle’s tail secretions changes\nin the intensity of its hue as the Pokémon’s\nemotions change.


When it examines things, before touching them\nwith its hands, it makes lip contact and then\ndiligently licks all the dirt off its lips.
When it hears the crash of thunder, Elekid’s\nmood improves. It can be useful to record that\nsound and play it when Elekid’s feeling down.
When flames drip from its nose, that means it\nhas a cold. Have it lie down for a nice rest in\nsome magma.
It produces over five gallons of milk a day. The\nhigher the quality of the pastures it lives in,\nthe richer and tastier its milk becomes.
Their eggs are such a delicacy that some say\neating one will bring you happiness. These eggs\nfetch the highest prices on the market.



Born underground, it eats its way through dirt to\nthe surface, where its parents are. It doesn’t\ndeal well with the bright light it finds there.
This troublesome Pokémon can’t wait to evolve,\nso it relieves its stress by wildly propelling itself\naround using compressed gas.
It wanders through the mountains seeking\nopponents to fight. If it finds an opponent that’s\nnot worthy, Tyranitar ignores it and wanders on.





























With its long, thin wings, it catches updrafts\nand flies like a glider high up into the sky.
It places small Pokémon into its spacious beak\nand carries them around. No one knows where\nit’s taking them.



If it’s in a pinch, it will secrete a sweet liquid\nfrom the tip of its head. Syrup made from\ngathering that liquid is tasty on bread.
Masquerain intimidates enemies with the eyelike\npatterns of its eyespots. If that doesn’t work, it\ndeftly makes its escape on its set of four wings.











It practices its slaps by repeatedly slapping\ntree trunks. It has been known to slap an\nExeggutor and get flung away.
Although they enjoy comparing their strength,\nthey’re also kind. They value etiquette, praising\nopponents they battle.

It moves less than an inch a year, but when\nit’s in a jam, it will spin and drill down into the\nground in a split second.


It digs through the ground with its hard claws\nand crunches down gems with its thick pointy\nteeth. Carbink is its favorite food.
A cunning and terrifying Pokémon, its cuteness\nmakes opponents let down their guard—and\nthen it swallows them whole with its huge jaws.





Friction between the air and its fur produces\nstatic electricity. When Electrike runs, it makes\na crackling sound.
Manectric can be found beneath unnatural\nthunderclouds. People say it can run at the\nsame speed as lightning striking.







They’re such cowards that they won’t hunt\nalone. When five or so of them get together,\nthey suddenly turn ferocious!
People believe that carrying one of its\ndiscarded fangs will prevent mishaps at sea,\nso the fangs are made into accessories.
It swims along with its mouth open and\nswallows down seawater along with its food.\nIt sprays excess water out of its nostrils.
They eat so many fish Pokémon that when\nWailord become too numerous, fishermen have\nto chase them off.


You can tell how it’s feeling by the smoke\nspouting from its shell. Tremendous velocity\nis a sign of good health.


Its steps are shaky and stumbling. Walking for a\nlong time makes it feel sick.
Its jaws are strong enough to crush rocks but\nso heavy that it can’t get up if it flips over.\nSandile seize those moments as their chance.
It vibrates its wings to generate ultrasonic\nwaves, causing its prey to faint. Then it buries\nthe prey alive in the sand to preserve it.
By flapping their wings, Flygon cause\nsandstorms that conceal Krookodile.\nThe team then splits the prey they catch.








Its entire body is gooey. When pecked at by\nbird Pokémon, it slips and slides its way\nto freedom.
Whiscash shakes the ground at high intensities\nto intimidate its opponents. It swallows its prey\nwhole—along with mud from the swamp floor.
Individuals that have been set free by Trainers\nwho could no longer raise them have become\ncommon, and they can now be found in Alola.
Its temperament is rough and it loves to fight,\nbut as soon as its pincers break off, it turns\ncowardly. It stays timid until they grow back.
Depictions of Pokémon similar to Baltoy have\nbeen found on the walls of caves where\nprimitive humans lived.
If it gets wet, its body melts. When rain starts\nto fall, it wraps its whole body up with its\npsychic powers to protect itself.
In ancient times, it lived in warm seas. It\ndisguised itself as seaweed to ambush its prey\nand devoured them whole when they got close.
Normally, it lived on shallow sea shoals. When\nthe tide went out, this Pokémon came up on\nland to search for prey.
When restored Anorith are released into the\nocean, they don’t thrive, because the water\ncomposition has changed since their era.
It lived on land and went out into the sea to\nhunt for prey. Its sharp claws were its\ngreatest weapon.
They look ragged, so no one catches them. They\nlook like they’d taste bad, so predators won’t\neat them. And their numbers continue to grow.
While Milotic is said to be the most beautiful\nPokémon, Trainers who like Feebas and have\nraised it are seemingly disappointed by Milotic.
Although its form changes with the weather,\nthat is apparently the result of a chemical\nreaction and not the result of its own free will.
It changes its hue to blend into its surroundings.\nIf no one takes notice of it for too long, it will\npout and never reveal itself.
It eats up emotions like malice, jealousy, and\nresentment, so some people are grateful for\nits presence.
It’s a stuffed toy that was thrown away and\nbecame possessed, ever searching for the one\nwho threw it away so it can exact its revenge.


The bunches of fruit growing around the necks\nof Tropius in Alola are especially sweet\ncompared to those in other regions.

The only thing unlucky about Absol is its\nappearance. It protects fields and warns people\nof disaster, so one ought to be grateful for it.

It feeds mainly on ice and snow. It’s only able to\nsurvive in a limited number of places in the\nwarm Alola region.
It freezes its prey and chews them whole.\nHowever, it prefers to eat Pokémon like Vanillite\nthat are already frozen.



Despite its appearance, it’s carnivorous. It\nclamps down on its prey with both sides of its\nshell and doesn’t let go until they stop moving.
It’s not the strongest swimmer. It wags its tail to\nlure in its prey and then gulps them down as\nsoon as they get close.
The color of its body changes with the water\ntemperature. The coloration of Gorebyss in Alola\nis almost blindingly vivid.
Thought to have gone extinct, Relicanth was\ngiven a name that is a variation of the name of\nthe person who discovered it.
There was an era when it was overfished due to\nthe rumor that having one of its heart-shaped\nscales would enable you to find a sweetheart.
Whenever it sees bird Pokémon flying through\nthe sky, it becomes envious and smashes its\nsurroundings to bits with headbutts.
The cells within its body are changing at a\nbewildering pace. Its hard shell is made from\nthe same substance as bone.
Overjoyed at finally being able to fly, it flies all\nover the place and usually doesn’t land until it’s\ncompletely exhausted and needs to sleep.
Instead of blood, magnetism flows through its\nbody. When it’s feeling bad, try giving it\na magnet.
With its two brains, it fires powerful psychic\nenergy to stop its prey in their tracks.
It boasts not only psychic powers but also\nfantastic strength. It grabs its prey with its four\nlegs and holds them in place with its claws.































A primeval Pokémon, it possesses a hard and\nsturdy skull, lacking any intelligence within.
In ancient times, people would dig up fossils of\nthis Pokémon and use its skull, which is harder\nthan steel, to make helmets.
A mild-mannered, herbivorous Pokémon, it used\nits face to dig up tree roots to eat. The skin on\nits face was plenty tough.
The bones of its face are huge and hard, so\nthey were mistaken for its spine until after this\nPokémon was successfully restored.










While they normally live in the sea, they can\nfunction on land, too, until their skin dries out.
Long ago, it had a shell on its back. There’s now\na vestigial plate on its back that’s hard but thin.
In their search for comfortable trees, they get\ninto territorial disputes with groups of\nPassimian. They win about half the time.
Its round body is stuffed with souls and\nexpands each time it leads someone away.
There’s a rumor that if you catch a Drifblim\nfloating on the wind at dusk, you’ll be carried\naway to the afterlife.
Its arms and legs are weak, but when it rolls its\nears up tight and then unleashes them with its\nfull force, it can smash boulders to dust.
Lopunny regrows its coat twice a year. Mufflers\nand hats made from its fur are really warm.
Feared for its wrath and the curses it spreads,\nthis Pokémon will also, on a whim, cast spells\nthat help people.
It will absolutely not forgive failure from or\nbetrayal by its goons. It has no choice in this\nif it wants to maintain the order of the flock.







It discharges moisture from its eyes, making it\nlook like it’s crying—apparently an effective way\nof getting enemies to let down their guard.
It does its absolute best to mimic the\nmovements and expressions of its opponents,\nbut it’s still not very good at it.
Usually it’s a well-behaved Pokémon, but if you\ntake its round rock away, it will cry and fuss\nand throw a big old tantrum.


It reacts to anything that moves—flies right at it\nand bites it. Sometimes it injures itself, but it\ndoesn’t care too much.
It loves shiny things. When it finds a Sableye\ntrying to catch a Carbink, Gabite becomes\nfuriously angry and attacks the Sableye.

It hides food under its long fur, but it\nsometimes forgets about it and causes\na stinky disturbance.
It knows how people and Pokémon feel by\nlooking at their auras. It doesn’t approach\ndangerous opponents.
It concentrates its mental energy and fires off\nmysterious waves called auras, which can crush\nboulders of large size to dust.







When night falls, their pink patterns begin to\nshine. They’re popular with divers, so there are\nresorts that feed them to keep them close.
Deep down at the bottom of the ocean, prey is\nscarce. Lumineon get into fierce disputes with\nLanturn over food.
It’s highly friendly and easily tamed. Tours that\ntake people swimming with Mantyke are a\nsuper-popular beach activity.


One Weavile will trip a Sandshrew and flip it\nover, and then another Weavile will deal the\nfinishing blow with its sharp claws.
It uses radar to monitor its territory. Intruders\nare quickly disposed of with a hyper beam.

It protects itself by freezing its fur into sharp\nneedles. It can drop its body temperature below\n–75 degrees Fahrenheit.


Its behavior is noticeably unstable, which is\napparently due to the incompetence of the\nengineer who updated its programming.

Although it can control its units known as\nMini-Noses, they sometimes get lost and don’t\ncome back.

It freezes hikers who have come to climb snowy\nmountains and carries them back to its home. It\nonly goes after men it thinks are handsome.



























This Pokémon has excellent judgment.\nIf it decides it can’t defeat an opponent,\nit immediately turns tail and vamooses.
The longer its black fur grows, the harder and\nmore impervious it gets. Claws and fangs can’t\neasily penetrate it.
It pays no mind to the cold, thanks to its long\nwarm coat. Stoutland in Alola look a\nlittle uncomfortable.















The hexagonal hole is its ear. Deep in that ear is\nan energy core, so if you stick your hand in\nthere, Roggenrola will be very angry!
The energy overflowing from its body has\nturned into orange crystals that are hard\nenough to smash diamonds.
When it fires off energy with all its might, the\npower creates countless fissures on its body.



















To protect itself, it shoots cotton from its body.\nWhen it gets wet in the rain, its cotton grows\nmoist and heavy, and it can’t move as well.
This nuisance sneaks into people’s homes,\nwhere it hides important things and scatters\ncotton all over the place.
Some say if you dry the leaves on its head, boil\nthem down, and drink the infusion, your vigor\nwill return, so Petilil is popular with the elderly.

Alola, where it’s warm all year round, is a\ncomfortable environment for this Pokémon.\nSometimes you’ll even see it outside of deserts.

When it spots prey, even at a distance of over\n30 miles, it swims through the desert as if it\nwere water, then jumps out and chomps them.





They move in small groups, walking around lazily.\nAnyone who makes eye contact gets smacked\nwith a headbutt.
This Pokémon may be rude, but it takes very\ngood care of its family, its friends, and its turf.



It was restored from an ancient fossil. Tirtouga\nlived in the sea but came up onto the land to\nsearch for prey.

This ancient Pokémon’s plumage is delicate,\nso if anyone other than an experienced\nprofessional tries to restore it, they will fail.

A clean freak that will not allow even the\nslightest mess, it uses its tail like a mop to\nthoroughly clean any and all filth.

Jellicent is always hanging around fancy cruise\nships and tankers, hoping to drag away its prey.
Fishermen take them along on long voyages,\nbecause if you have an Alomomola with you,\nthere’ll be no need for a doctor or medicine.










It controls tremendous psychic power. Most\nreports of alien sightings are actually just\npeople mistaking Elgyem for an alien.

Some say that ancient people invented Golurk\nto serve as a laborer. It follows its master’s\norders faithfully.

With its powerful legs and sturdy claws, it can\ncrack even the hard shells of Shellder and pluck\nout their insides.
The more scars it has on its front, the more\nheroic it’s considered to be. Those with many\nscars on their back are mocked by the flock.
Mandibuzz gives it the bones it wears. Vullaby’s\nwings are short, so it can’t fly yet, but it jumps\naround, dreaming of wide open skies.
It skillfully arranges the bones of its prey to\nconstruct its nest. Most of the bones\nare Cubone.





When battling opponents, it sprays fire from its\nfive horns. The max temperature of the flames\ncan reach nearly 5,500 degrees Fahrenheit.
As it flies, it scatters its flaming scales. It was\nfeared by ancient people, who referred to it as\n“the rage of the sun.”























While it’s an amiable Pokémon, if you touch it\nunexpectedly, it will heat up its body in an\ninstant, and you’ll be burned.
It scatters embers in the tall grass. Then bug\nPokémon, frightened by the flames, come\nflying out, and Fletchinder gobbles them up.
Its tough wings don’t allow fire to pass through\nthem. A long time ago, firefighters’ outfits were\nmade from Talonflame wings.



When they’re young, they live with a pride. Once\nthey’re able to hunt prey on their own, they’re\nkicked out and have to make their own way.
The males are usually lazy, but when attacked\nby a strong foe, a male will protect its friends\nwith no regard for its own safety.

Complete restoration is impossible, allowing\nroom for theories that its entire body was\nonce covered in a feather-like coat.
It lived in cold areas in ancient times. It’s said\nthat when Amaura whinnies, auroras appear in\nthe night sky.

It uses its horns to check out its surroundings.\nThey’re very sensitive, so if you grab them, it\nwill feel a strong shock and be unable to move.
It crawls along sluggishly. The swirly protrusion\non its back is filled with its brain and\nother organs.

By imitating the voice of a child, it causes\npeople to get hopelessly lost deep in the forest.\nIt’s trying to make friends with them.

Its body is soft and weak. In nature, its\nperpetual fate is to be seen by others as food.
Its hard shell doesn’t crack a bit even if Pikipek\npecks at it, but it will tip over, spilling out\nits insides.
Nectar from pretty flowers is its favorite food.\nIn fields of flowers, it has heated battles with\nCutiefly for territory.






This Pokémon is common but hazardous. Its\nsharp incisors can easily cut right through\nhard wood.
Its whiskers are essential for maintaining its\nbalance. No matter how friendly you are, it will\nget angry and bite you if you touch its whiskers.
Due to its short wings, it can’t fly long\ndistances. It wanders about restlessly and\npecks at bug Pokémon.
In Alola, fish Pokémon are its prey. It can be\nseen circling above the ocean searching\nfor food.
The eggs of bird Pokémon are its favorite food.\nIt swallows eggs whole, so sometimes an egg\ngets stuck, and Ekans faints.
After stunning its opponents with the pattern\non its stomach, it quickly wraps them up in its\nbody and waits for them to stop moving.
While sleeping, it generates electricity in the\nsacs in its cheeks. If it’s not getting enough\nsleep, it will be able to use only weak electricity.
Because so many Trainers like the way Pikachu\nlooks, you don’t see this Pokémon very often.
When its skin gets wrinkled from moisture, it\nheads for a volcano. It lies flat on a spot with a\nlot of geothermal heat and dries itself out.
