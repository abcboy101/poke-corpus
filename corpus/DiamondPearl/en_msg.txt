By the way, have you visited the\nTrainers' School?\cNot yet, right?\nYou really must visit there!\c
                                          
By the way, have you participated\nin the Pokétch campaign?\cNot yet, right?\nYou really must try!\c
Hello! Yes, you!\nYou with that cool scarf!\cYou should have seen the boy that\ncame running by earlier.\cHe ran past me so quickly, I couldn't\neven manage a hello.
Jubilife City is a big place.\nTake your time sightseeing.
Jubilife City is the love of my life\nWords can't do it justice.

Oh, oh, oh?\cYou call yourself a Pokémon Trainer?\nAnd yet you have no Pokétch?\cThat is, Pokémon Watch, or Pokétch\nfor short!\cOh my, you are a rare case\nindeed!\c
You see, I invented, and now\nmanufacture, Pokétches.\cNot only that, I'm now conducting\nthe Pokétch promotional campaign!\cAll you have to do is find three\nclowns in Jubilife City.\cIf you can find them...\nI will gift you with a Pokétch!

Hi! I'm a Pokétch campaign clown!\nLet's roll out my question!\cDoes a Pokémon grow by defeating\nothers and gaining Exp. Points?
Ding-ding!\nYou're absolutely correct!\c
Bzzzzt!\nThat's the wrong answer...
Pokémon grow stronger by defeating\nother Pokémon in battle.\cSome Pokémon even grow into an\nentirely different form in a process\rknown as evolution.\c

Hi! I'm a Pokétch campaign clown!\nLet's roll out my question!\cJust like Pokémon types, the moves\nof Pokémon also have types?
Ding-ding!\nYou're absolutely correct!\c
Bzzzzt!\nThat's the wrong answer...
If the Pokémon's type matches its\nmove's type, that move is made much\rmore powerful!\c

Hi! I'm a Pokétch campaign clown!\nLet's roll out my question!\cCan a Pokémon hold an item?
Ding-ding!\nYou're absolutely correct!\c
Bzzzzt!\nThat's the wrong answer...
A Pokémon may hold a single item.\cSome items become effective as soon\nas they are held by a Pokémon.\cBerries are eaten by Pokémon as\nnecessary during battle.\c
Here you go!\nYour Pokétch Coupon!\c
Hi, there. You should stick around.\nWe're doing a Pokétch campaign soon.\cBefore it starts, I think you should\nbrush up at the Trainers' School.

Rowan: That lot...\nThey called themselves Team Galactic.\cWhen Pokémon evolve, they seem to\nrelease some type of energy...\cHowever, I believe that it's a mystic\npower far beyond our control.\cBut Team Galactic seems to be trying\nto use that power for something...\cAnyway, [VAR 0103(0000)], well done!\nYou battle quite capably.\cThe sight of you Trainers and Pokémon\nbattling together...\cI made the right decision in\nentrusting you with a Pokédex!\c

Lucas: [VAR 0103(0001)], did you know\nabout this?\cThe professor studies about the\nevolution of Pokémon, too.\cAccording to his research, 90% of\nall Pokémon are somehow tied\rto evolution!\cI guess that means some Pokémon\nmust undergo weird evolutions.\cSo, [VAR 0103(0001)]...\nLet's keep working on our Pokédex\rproject for the prof!\c

The way you look...\nYou're obviously a Trainer!\cCan you tell me what type of Pokémon\nyou like?
The Fire type?\nYou must have a fiery personality.
A person that likes the Water type\nmust be somewhat cool.
You chose the Grass type?\nNo wonder you look so calm.
Did you see me on TV?\nI was in an interview!
When you walk with your Pokémon,\nthey gradually grow friendlier.
OK, set six Poké Balls in my\nbelt...\cYeah, that'll do it. At most, you\ncan have six Pokémon with you.
                                                         
Hiya, where'd you come from?\c...\cTwinleaf Town, huh...\nIt's a nice place. Quiet and all.\cJubilife City is a big place, so it\nmight be a bit of a shock to you.
Hello, Trainer!\nDo you know much about Pokémon?
Ah, I see!\nYou are knowledgeable!\cI imagine you wouldn't see the need\nto visit the Trainers' School, then.\cBut do visit if you have the time.\nYou may discover something new!
Oh, you're not knowledgeable...\nBut not to worry!\rThere's the Trainers' School.\cThe school will teach you the\nbasics of Pokémon.
Past here is the GTS, which stands\nfor Global Trade Station.\cOh, I'm sorry, you don't have\nany Gym Badges.\cThe GTS is off-limits if you don't\nhave a Gym Badge. Sorry!\c

A Pokémon holding that Quick Claw can\nsometimes attack first, even if it\ris normally a little bit slow.\cThere are other items that are only\nuseful when given to a Pokémon.\cTry finding other items that you can\nmake your Pokémon hold.\c...I sound like I'm a teacher or\nsomething.

That's a big globe, eh?\cWhere do I live on it now?\nLet's see if I can point it out...
They say if you communicate with\nsomeone, their location is\rrecorded on this giant globe.
All I need to do is leave a Pokémon\nhere to trade.\cWho knows, it might be traded while\nI'm asleep tonight.
You can easily trade Pokémon with\nPokémon fans around the world.\cIsn't that something?
You can register where you live on\nthis giant globe.\cOnce you do, your location will\nbe displayed to anyone you\rcommunicate with.

[VAR 0103(0001)]: Hey, [VAR 0103(0000)]!\nDid you come to study, too?\cI went ahead and memorized everything\nthat was up on the blackboard.\cAfter all, it's the Trainer's job to\navoid having their precious Pokémon\rhurt in battle, right?\cSo, [VAR 0103(0000)], what brings you?\nHuh?\rYou've got something for me?\c
[VAR 0103(0000)] delivered the Parcel.
[VAR 0103(0001)]: So, what is this...?\cScore!\nIt's a Town Map!\cHuh?!\nWhy are there two in here?\cI like it a lot, but I don't need two.\nHere, [VAR 0103(0000)], you take one!\c
[VAR 0103(0001)]: Hmm...\cWell, according to the Town Map,\nI guess Oreburgh City is where\rI should be going next.\cThere's a Gym, so it'd be perfect for\nraising the Pokémon I just caught.\cWell, I'm on the road to becoming\nthe greatest Trainer of all time!\cSee you around!\c
You just became a Trainer, did you?\cYou should look up topics that you're\nnot familiar with.
                             
We learned about Pokémon types\ntoday. Umm...\cGrass is weak to Fire,\nFire is weak to Water, and\rWater is weak to Grass!\cI think that's how it goes!
Pokémon are smart enough to use\nitems they're holding.\cBut they won't know what to do with\nman-made items like Potions and\rAntidotes.
I wrote an essay in my notebook on \nwhat makes a true Pokémon Trainer.
Doing it is the best way to learn!\nCan we get a battle with you?
Go!\nMy Pokémon, go!\c
Aww! But battling is the best way\nto learn about Pokémon!
It's hard to win if you don't have\nsome Pokémon to choose from.
Whew! You're really good!\cWe've been studying every day, but\nwe were no match at all!\cYou'd be able to use this Technical\nMachine properly. Here you go!\c
A Technical Machine, or TM for short,\ncontains a Pokémon move.\cUsing a TM, you can instantly teach\nits move to a Pokémon.\cBut remember--a TM is good for one\nuse only. Don't waste it!
I just became friends with my\nPokémon.\cI'm not sure if we can do this\nproperly, but may we battle?
I need to try the things I learned\nbefore I forget them!\c
Boo!\nWhere's your sense of adventure?\cDon't be shy about talking to people\nand getting into battles!
Do you think we would have done\nbetter if I used Potions?
We were actually confident that we\nwould do pretty good.\cBut I'm completely impressed by how\ntough you are.\cIf you'd like, talk to my friend and\nget a Technical Machine from him.
The blackboard lists status changes\nthat may affect Pokémon in battle.\c
Which would you like to read about?
If a Pokémon is poisoned, it will\nsteadily lose HP.\cThe effects of poison remain after\na battle.\cA poisoned Pokémon's HP will drop\nwhile it is traveling.\cHeal a poisoning using an Antidote.\c
If a Pokémon becomes paralyzed,\nits Speed stat drops.\cIn addition, it may not be able to\nmove while it is in battle.\cParalysis remains after battle.\nCure it using a Parlyz Heal.\c
If a Pokémon falls asleep, it will be\nunable to attack.\cThe Pokémon may wake up on its own,\nbut if a battle ends while it is\rsleeping, it will stay asleep.\cWake it up using an Awakening.\c
A burn reduces the Attack stat and\nsteadily reduces the victim's HP.\cA burn lingers after battle.\nCure a burn using a Burn Heal.\c
If a Pokémon is frozen, it becomes\ncompletely helpless.\cThe Pokémon may thaw out on its own,\nbut if a battle ends while it is\rfrozen, it will stay frozen.\cThaw it out using an Ice Heal.\c
It's a notebook filled with writing.\nLet's see...\cPokémon are to be caught using\nPoké Balls.\cUp to six Pokémon can accompany\na Trainer.\cA Trainer is someone who catches\nPokémon, raises them, and battles\rwith them.\cA Trainer's mission is to defeat the\nstrong Trainers who await challengers\rin Pokémon Gyms.

You were strong enough to take down\nmy prized team of Pokémon.\cIn recognition of that power,\nI give you this: the Mine Badge!\c
[VAR 0103(0000)] received\nthe Mine Badge from Byron!
Having the Mine Badge enables you to\nuse the hidden move Strength anytime\routside of battle.\cAnd you now have six Gym Badges.\cThat means all Pokémon up to Lv. 70\nwill obey you without question.\cHere!\nTake this, too!\c
That [VAR 0108(0000)] contains the move\n[VAR 0106(0001)].\cIf it hits, it may also lower the\ntarget's Special Defense.

Hey, there!\nChamp-to-be!\cThe Gym Leader here uses Steel-type\nPokémon.\cSteel-type Pokémon have high Defense,\nso you'd have to hit them hard!
Oh! [VAR 0103(0000)]!\nYou've beaten the Gym Leader!\cGood going!\nThat makes it six Gym Badges!\cI tell you what, you're really turning\ninto one fine Trainer.\cIf you were to say you're going to\ntry to become the Pokémon Champ...\cNo one'd laugh at you now!\nI'm in your corner, kiddo!

[VAR 0103(0000)]: I told you, the Gym\nLeader isn't here.\cIf you want to take the Gym\nchallenge, you'd better go down to\rthe mine and ask him.\cBut, boy, a Gym Leader is in a\ndifferent class of toughness.\cEven I'm feeling run down.
[VAR FF01(00C8)]Thud!![VAR FF01(0064)]\c
[VAR 0103(0000)]: Whoops! [VAR 0103(0001)]!\nYou got the Gym Badge, huh?\cEterna City is the next place with\na Gym that gives away Badges, right?\c
So, yeah, I went to Route 207, but\nyou can't go there without a Bicycle.\cI made my team battle and toughened\nthem up, so it wasn't a waste.\c
So, I'm going back to Jubilife City.\nNext stop, the Eterna Gym Badge!\cTen seconds before I dash!\cNine...\cBah! Who's got time to count?!\c
Howdy, Trainer!\cIf you don't have a single Gym Badge,\nother Trainers will look down on\ryou like you're a total noob, right?\cSo, I'll show you where the town's\nPokémon Gym is.\c
Huh?\nThere's someone there.
Is that guy in front of the Gym\nyour friend?\cHe's sort of twitchy and impatient.
Oh, hi, you're back!\nThe Gym Leader's waiting for you.
Can I see your Trainer Case?\cIt's got the Gym Badge you just\nwon, right?
                                                                                                                               
                               
                                                                                                                                           
The Gym Leader went off to work in\nthe mine.
The Gym Leader is young, but he's\nthe mine's safety supervisor.\cHe's an expert in more than just one\nfield!
Everyone's proud of the mine.\cThey're digging for coal under the\nsea as we speak...\cIt's amazing how they do it!
Up ahead there's a huge mountain\nthat towers above everything.\cIt divides Sinnoh into two distinct\nhalves.
Have you seen the vents?\nThey release steam from down below.
                              
These vents exchange the hot air\ndown below with the fresh air outside.\cLooking down them gives me the urge\nto start yelling into 'em! Hello!
There's no question. This is hard,\nhard work.\cBut working alongside Pokémon...\nIt gives me a boost somehow.\cHere, take one of these.\c
Feeling hale and hearty puts a smile\non my face. And that makes me happy.
This pile of dirty sand is called\na slag heap.\cIt's the waste from sorting coal.
Chop, chop, MACHOP!\nChop, chop away on rocks! ~♪
TMs are single use only, but HMs\ncan be used over and over.\cIt's tricky trying to decide which\nPokémon should learn what moves.
When I run around with my Running\nShoes on, it feels like I'm the center\rof attention!
MACHOP: Macho! Chopo!

Welcome!\nThis is the Oreburgh Pokémon Gym!\cI'm Roark, the Gym Leader!\cI'm but one Trainer who decided to\nwalk proudly with Rock-type Pokémon!\cAs the Gym Leader, I need to see\nyour potential as a Trainer.\cAnd, I'll need to see the toughness\nof the Pokémon that battle with you!\c
This is embarrassing...\cI went and lost to a Trainer who\ndidn't have a single Gym Badge...\cBut that's tough. You were strong,\nand I was weak. That's all there is.\cAccording to Pokémon League rules,\nI have to give you our Gym Badge\rsince you've beaten me, the Leader.\cHere's your official Pokémon League\nCoal Badge.\c
[VAR 0103(0000)] received\nthe Coal Badge from Roark!
Having that Coal Badge means your\nPokémon can now use the hidden move\rRock Smash outside of battle.\cYou should also take this, too.\c
That [VAR 0108(0000)] contains\nthe move Stealth Rock.\cIt's a move that inflicts damage on\nfoes that switch into battle.\cIncidentally, a TM will teach its move\nto a Pokémon instantly.\cBut a TM will break when you use it,\nso make certain you want a Pokémon\rto learn that move.
In this region of Sinnoh, there are\nseven other Gym Leaders.\cI should warn you--they're a lot\ntougher than I am!
Howdy!\nHow's it going, Champ-to-be?\cThat's what I said to a really\nimpatient boy earlier, too.\cThe Gym Leader is a user of\nRock-type Pokémon.\cWell, listen. Rock-type Pokémon\nreally hate water, all right?\cThey're also weak to Grass-type\nmoves.\cGee, they sure have weaknesses!\cBut don't think it will be easy.\cYou don't get to be a Gym Leader\nwithout covering for weaknesses.\cGoing after a Rock-type Pokémon\nwith a Fire-type Pokémon won't be\reasy, either.\cThat's all the advice I can give.\nThanks for listening!
Oh! [VAR 0103(0000)]!\nYou've taken care of the Gym Leader!\cSo, did my advice come in handy\nor what?\cIf my advice was useful, it'd be\ngreat if you'd become my fan!

Hmmm...\cWhat is your favorite kind of\nTrainer? Can you tell me?\c
Which kind of Trainer would you like\nto be?
[VAR 010E(0000)] is the kind of\nTrainer you want to be?
I see! So [VAR 010E(0000)] is the\nkind of Trainer you like.\cIf that's the case, others may come\nto see you in the same way.\c
OK, then I'll just talk to you later!
Hello! You've been mistaken for\n[VAR 010E(0000)], haven't you?\cBut I think you can also pass for\na different kind of Trainer.\cSo, how about telling me what kind of\nTrainer that you like?\c

There are eight Gym Leaders in\nthe Sinnoh region.\cThe objective for Trainers is\nto get Gym Badges from them all.
A Gym Leader isn't just like any\nTrainer you meet.\cI'd take as many Pokémon as possible\nif I were you.

Giving nicknames to Pokémon is\nthe way to go.\cIt makes you feel as if they're your\nvery own.
But he named our PSYDUCK “Yellow”\njust because of its color...\cI don't understand the logic behind\nthat at all.
Are you catching Pokémon?\nHere, take this if you'd like.\c
The Dusk Ball is a Poké Ball designed\nfor use in darkness.\cIt works better if you use it at\nnight or in a cave.
Yellow: Duuuck?

Do you make your Pokémon hold items?\cIf you'd like, let one hold this\n[VAR 0108(0000)].\c

Listen, listen. Do you have a Pokémon\ncalled MACHOP?\cWould you be willing to trade your\nMACHOP for my ABRA?
Be nice to my ABRA!\cI'll be sure to look after your\nMACHOP in return!
What I asked for was a MACHOP...
Oh, OK...\nWell, I can't make you trade me.\cBut if you change your mind,\nI'll be right here waiting!
Thanks to Pokémon, I got to be\nfriends with you!
A Pokémon obtained in a trade\ngrows quickly.\cBut if a Pokémon grows too much,\nit will often ignore the Trainer.\cOf course, it won't matter if you\nhave lots of Gym Badges.

Hello! Welcome to the Oreburgh\nMining Museum!
Hello, hello!\nHow are you?\cI study Pokémon Fossils!\nMe! Right here and now!\c
You have a Fossil for me, yes?\nShall I turn it into a Pokémon?
Which Fossil should I turn back\ninto a Pokémon? Choose! Now!
OK, I will do that! Turn that Fossil\nback into a Pokémon, surely I will!
You don't wish that I extract any\nPokémon from a Fossil. Fine, then!
I am in the process of extracting\nyour Pokémon from a Fossil.\cYou go outside, yes, please. Now!\nTime alone is what I now need. NOW!!!
You were gone too long!\nYou kept us waiting! Unacceptable!\cThis is your [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nYou be good to it, OK!\c
[VAR 0103(0000)] received\nthe [VAR 0100(0001)]!\c
Give a nickname to the [VAR 0100(0001)]\nyou received?
But, no, I cannot do this!\nYou have too many Pokémon with you!\cI must hold it for you, so come back,\nyou, and take it away, please.
If it is a Fossil that you obtain,\nbring it to me if you must.
On the verge of a breakthrough,\nI am, to achieve extraction from\rFossils.\cFrom Fossils I can extract Pokémon,\nbut not yet, not yet.
Whoa! So this is coal?\nI never expected something this big!
Wow! The Pokémon that carried this\nmust be terribly strong!
Well, how about that!\cThe Oreburgh Mine extends\nunder the seafloor!
How Coal Is Made   1\c“In a time long before history,\nvegetative matter was swept along\cby rain and rivers. It came to be\nburied under the ground.”
How Coal Is Made   2\c“The buried plant matter was\nforced ever deeper under the ground\cdue to tremors and fissures caused\nby the shifting landmasses.”
How Coal Is Made   3\c“Deep under the ground, the\nplant matter was subjected to heavy\cpressure and the heat of magma.\nIt gradually turned into coal.”
Samples of coal from different regions\nare displayed.
The box contains categorized samples\nof coal.
Different kinds of lamps are\ndisplayed.\cThey appear to have been worn\non someone's head while underground.
Badly scarred wooden tools are\ndisplayed.\cThey apparently dug out coal using\nthese tools in the olden days.

Oh, is that a Pokédex?\nYou must be helping Professor Rowan?\cWhat's your name?\c...\cOK, hello, [VAR 0103(0000)].\nI'll be sure to remember that name!\cMy name is Cynthia.\nI'm a Trainer just like you.\cI've been studying Pokémon mythology\nlately, just out of curiosity.\c
Here in Eterna City, there is a\nstatue of an ancient Pokémon.\cAccording to myth, it was an\nextremely powerful Pokémon.\cWho knows? You may encounter\nsomething like it while you're\rtraveling with your Pokédex.\cTry using this.\nIt should help you on your way.\c
Cynthia: Remember, the hidden move\nCut can be used in the field.\cIt will let you go places that were\npreviously inaccessible to you.\cThat's important for filling up your\nPokédex, right?\cThen luck be with you, young Trainer!\c
Hey! You there, kid!\nStay away from that Pokémon statue!\cTeam Galactic is conducting an\nofficial investigation here!
Hey, you! Yeah, you, Trainer!\cErrr...\nIt's OK. Never mind. You look tough.\cI won't take... Um, I'll just let you\nkeep your Pokémon. Carry on!

Since that Team Galactic building went\nup, the city's atmosphere has gotten\rall creepy and tense.\cI don't know what those people are\ndoing up in that place...
With Team Galactic gone, what's going\nto happen to their building?
My friend said Team Galactic took his\nfavorite Pokémon away.\cI don't think he's telling the truth.\nTeam Galactic looks so cool.\rThey don't look like common thugs.
Do you use Bike stands?\cIt looks so cool to hop off your Bike\nand then lean on it. It looks so smooth!
If you're visiting Eterna, you need to\nget yourself a Bicycle and take a\rride down the Cycling Road.

Eterna City's not anything like it\nwas before, way back in the day.

Eh? Did you want something?\cHow silly of me to even ask.\nYou want to free the Pokémon.\rYeah, that's gonna happen!\c
Well, aren't you tough...?\cIt's OK, though. Our official Pokémon-\nstatue investigation is finished.\cMars has collected energy from\nthe Valley Windworks.\cWe're pretty much finished here.\nI'll let you in on one little thing.\cOur boss is researching the myths\nof ancient Pokémon.\cWith the power of mythical Pokémon,\nhe will become the ruler of Sinnoh...\cI suggest you keep out of Team\nGalactic's affairs from now on.\cThis is your last warning!\c
CLEFAIRY: Pi...
What is it with this Team Galactic?\cWhy did they take our Pokémon?\nWhat are they trying to accomplish?
I got my CLEFAIRY back, and it's all\nthanks to you!\cBut that Team Galactic...\cThey said, “Clefairy came from\nspace. Hand it over!”\cTheir logic baffles me still.\nIt's like they are from space!\cAnyway, they're gone now.\nThank you very much!\cI can't thank you enough right now,\nbut cruise by my Cycle Shop, OK?\c

Hello, hello!\nI am the official Name Rater!\cWant me to rate the nicknames of\nyour Pokémon?
Which Pokémon's nickname should\nI critique?
[VAR 0101(0000)], is it?\nThat's a decent nickname!\cBut would you like to give it\nan even better name?\cHow about it?
Ah, good. Then, what shall the new\nnickname be?
Done! From now on, this Pokémon\nshall be known as [VAR 0101(0000)]!\cIt is a better name than before!\nHow fortunate for you!
I see.\nPlease come visit again.
Done! From now on, this Pokémon\nshall be known as [VAR 0101(0000)]!\cIt looks no different from before,\nand yet, this is vastly superior!\cHow fortunate for you!
[VAR 0101(0000)], is it?\nThat is a truly impeccable name!\cTake good care of [VAR 0101(0000)]!
Now, now. That is merely an Egg!\nAn Egg can go by no other name!\n
Excuse me, but do you got that\nPokémon named BUIZEL?\cWanna trade it for my CHATOT?
Yes! So awesome! A BUIZEL!\nI so promise I'll be good to it!\cOh yeah, CHATOT can learn some human\nspeech pretty quickly.\cTry out its move Chatter.\nYou'll totally see what I mean.
What I totally want is a BUIZEL...
Oh, OK. Totally got it.\nIt's all right if you don't want to.\cBut if you change your mind,\nlet's totally trade some Pokémon.
Did that CHATOT I traded you totally\nlearn that Chatter move?\cIt will mimic your speech if you use\nthat move outside of battle.
Hi! I'm the building superintendent.\nI maintain a vigilant 24-hour watch!
I'm...building...superintendent...\n...maintain...24-hour watch... Zzz...

Oh, my!\nYou've met [VAR 0134(0001)] Pokémon!\cWonderful! Yes, bravo!\nProfessor Rowan should be delighted!\cHere is something for you!\c
A Pokémon holding an Exp. Share\nwill be given some of the Exp. Points\rfrom battle.\cIt will get Exp. Points even if it\ndidn't actually battle.\cI would say an Exp. Share is quite\nuseful for raising weak Pokémon.\cAlso, a Pokémon you get in a trade\nmay disobey you if it is too high\rin level.\cDon't worry, though. It will obey if\nyou have enough Gym Badges.
You've met only [VAR 0134(0001)] Pokémon?\cHmm...\nYou've got to find at least 35.\cIf you can't, it will be tough to\ncomplete the Sinnoh Pokédex.

I am! I am the first to have gone\nunderground and dug some tunnels.\cYou can call me the Underground Man.\nEveryone else does.\cI'll make a gift of this to you.\nYou hold up your end of the deal\rand put it to good use!\c
My gift to you, the Explorer Kit,\nwill instantly take you underground!\cYou need only to use it, and you\nwill be down in the tunnels!\cThe Underground is a different world\nwhere you can do this, that,\rand the other thing, too!\cLet me mentor you into becoming\na full-fledged spelunker!\cWill you take on that challenge?
Let me mentor you as you become\na full-fledged spelunker!\cWill you take on that challenge?
I had hoped to teach a youngster\nlike you about the many charms of\rthe underground tunnels...\cBut I can't force you to accept my\nproposal if you're not inclined.\cSigh...\nI get so lonely sometimes...
Hm!\nWell said, my young friend!\cI will teach you by assigning missions.\nFirst, go underground!\cGoing underground is quite easy.\nSimply use your Explorer Kit.\cIf you accomplish that, I will give\nyou your next test.
You've not gone underground yet?\cTo get down to the underground\ntunnels, you need only to use your\rExplorer Kit.\cBut you need to be outside. It can't\nbe used indoors or in a cave.\cNow, off you go!
Hm! I see that you've gone down to\nthe underground tunnels!\cWell done!\nTake these as rewards!\c
Those are called Traps.\nThey're triggered when stepped on.\cThe Underground is a place where\nyou can go with your friends.\cYou might try setting those Traps\nwhen you're down there with others.\cNow, what should I assign you next...
How was it in the underground\ntunnels?\cBig and empty, I would think.\cBut that's only because you are\na novice spelunker!\cThere are many hidden things down there\nthat are not visible to the eye.\cFor my next test, I want you to dig\nup some Treasure or Spheres for me.\cWhile underground, check the Radar\nfor yellow spots.\cGo to such a location and search\nfor Treasure using the Touch Screen.
You've not located any Treasure \nor Spheres yet?\cListen. Check the Radar and go to\nany yellow spot that's shown.\cNext, use the Touch Screen to\nidentify places to dig.\cTry to get right on top of a yellow\nspot on the Radar, OK?\cOnce you are right in front of it,\npress the A Button!\cNow, off you go on your search!
Ah! You dug up what I was looking for!\nGood job on finding it!\cWell done, indeed!\nTake these as your reward!\c
Dig in the walls of the underground\ntunnels to unearth hidden stuff.\cFossils and Stones can be dug up and\nbrought out from down under.\cSpheres, which are gems, cannot be\nbrought out, but they can be\rexchanged for goods down there.\cNow, what should I assign you\nnext...?
My tests aren't over yet!\nNext, let's use some Spheres!\cThe Spheres one can find underground\nare very peculiar.\cWhen buried in the ground, they grow\ndaily, a little bit at a time.\cI want you to go bury these strange\nSpheres in the underground tunnels.\cThat is my latest test!
You've not buried the Spheres yet?\nYou're afraid of losing them?\cHave no fear! Spheres are easily\nburied and just as easily dug up.\cDon't be afraid. Go bury those\nSpheres like I've said.\cJust don't forget where you've buried\nthem--the Underground is huge!
Good, good!\nYou've buried your Spheres!\cThe next time you go underground,\nthey should have grown bigger!\cJust don't forget where you've buried\nyour Spheres!\cAnyway, well done!\nThis is your reward!\c
You may have seen them already, but\nthere are Sphere collectors.\cThey wander about in the underground\ntunnels seeking Spheres.\cThey'll happily trade you items for\nbig Spheres.\cNow, what shall I assign you next...?
Have you grown weary of repeatedly\ngoing back to the Underground?\cWell, it's not over yet!\nNext up is your Secret Base!\cThat's right, I will teach you how to\nmake your own Secret Base!\cAll you need is the Digger Drill\nI gave you earlier.\cSimply go underground and use the\nDigger Drill wherever you like.\cThat will instantly make you your\nvery own Secret Base!\cSo, your next assignment is: go make\nyour own Secret Base!
Hm? You don't know how to use\nthe Digger Drill?\cOK, I'll admit this test may have\nbeen a little tricky for you.\cAll you need to do is find the\nDigger Drill among your Traps.\cThen, face a wall and use the Digger\nDrill. That's all it takes.\cDo that and you'll have your Secret\nBase before you can say...\c[VAR FF01(00C8)]Boo![VAR FF01(0064)]\cNo, seriously though!
Ah, you've made your Secret Base!\nExcellent!\cI thought I might have been asking\ntoo much of you, but you did it!\cWell done!\nTake these as your reward!\c
Incidentally, a Digger Drill can\nbe used only once.\cIf you wish to move your Secret\nBase, you will need to obtain another\rDigger Drill.\cYou can trade a Sphere for one\nunderground.\cWhat should I make you do next...
Hm! You've stuck it out to the end!\nThis is my final test.\cYou've made yourself a Secret Base,\nbut it's totally empty, is it not?\cNot to worry! You can decorate your\nown Secret Base as you see fit!\cSo! For my final test, I want you to\ndecorate your Secret Base.\cUse furniture and interior goods\nto give your Secret Base character!
Ah, have I finally managed to stump\nyou?\cPerhaps you've left your Secret\nBase's door open?\cYou see, the underground tunnels are\nvisited by many Trainers.\cIt wouldn't do to have someone\nbarge in on you while you're working\ron your Secret Base.\cDon't forget to close the door while\nyou're redecorating!
Ah! You've even managed to decorate\nyour Secret Base!\cI knew I recognized a spelunker\nin you!\cDon't forget to close the door when\nyou're decorating!\cWe don't want any visitors getting\nhurt by walking in on you!\cAlso, if you want to place goods\nyou've received, store them in the\rPC first.\cAnyways, well done!\nThis is your reward!\c
There are ways of collecting more\ndecoration goods.\cYou can grow Spheres you've found\nand trade them for goods.\cIt's also possible to obtain goods\nfrom friends.
I've taught you all I know, but if\nyou insist, there is one more thing\rI should tell you.\cThe Secret Base you've made has Big\nBoulders that get in the way, yes?\cThere is actually a way of moving\nthose boulders aside...\cHowever, the task may be dangerous\nfor you now.\cI suppose I could tell you how when\nyou get better as a spelunker...\c
...Hm! However, you are someone I'd\nrecognized as a born spelunker...\cFine! I will tell you, but only\nbecause you're exceptional!\cYou know that you may go underground\nwith your friends, correct?\cThat means your friends are certain\nto have Secret Bases of their own.\cNow, this is what you must do:\nFirst, find a friend's Secret Base.\cNext, go to the PC and steal your\nfriend's Flag.\cThen, run back to your Secret Base\nand take the Flag to your PC!\cIf you can do that, I will permit\nyou to move boulders.
Ah! My spelunker!\nAre you spelunking with your friends?\cIt's a hundred times more fun to play\nwith friends underground!\cIf you manage to steal a Flag from\na friend's Secret Base, you be sure\rto come show me!
Wait! Don't tell me!\nYou've captured a Flag?\cExcellent! You should already be\ncapable of moving Big Boulders\rinside your Secret Base!\cYou can shunt aside a boulder by\nstoring it like furniture.\cAnyways, well done!\nThis is your reward!\c
There really is nothing else that\nI can teach you.\cIf you wish to put away more Big\nBoulders or put out more goods,\rkeep capturing more Flags.\cBecome the spelunking master for me!
So, my spelunker, are you going\nunderground with your friends?\cThe underground tunnels are vast.\nThey can be a place where you meet\cmany others like you.
Ah, you've captured three Flags!\cWell done!\nTake this as your reward!\c
Ah, you've captured ten Flags!\cWell done!\nTake this as your reward!\c
Oh! Oh! My goodness!\nYou've captured fifty Flags!\cFantastic!\nTake this as your reward!\c
You have been outstanding! There\nreally is nothing left to teach you.\cFrom now on, you are the spelunking\nmaster!
Oh? Your underground PC appears\nto be full.\cDiscard a decorative item or two,\nthen come see me again.
Hm!\nThis belongs to you!\c
The underground tunnels go\neverywhere!\cGrab your friends and let's play\ntogether using DS Wireless\rCommunications!
Let's dig up some Treasure!\cI'm from Oreburgh.\nI work at the mining museum there.\cI got advice from the Underground\nMan on digging up Treasure and Spheres.\cBefore I get digging, let me share\nhis advice with you.\cWhile you're digging, you may uncover\ndark rocks.\cThey are very hard! If you keep\nhitting them, the wall will collapse.\cDon't forget that, and you'll be\ndigging up Treasure in no time!
Oh, you'd like more advice on digging\nup Treasure and Spheres?\cWell, your Explorer Kit contains\na sledgehammer and a pickax.\cChoose either of these tools and\ntouch the lower screen to dig.\cYou get to keep the stuff you fully\nuncover before the wall collapses.\cDon't forget, the dark rocks are\nimpossible to break.\cIf you hit them too often, the wall\nwill collapse.\cDon't forget that, and you'll be\ndigging up Treasure in no time!
New and on sale!\nUnderground Radar!\cThe upper radar screen indicates\npossible Treasure locations.\cThe lower Touch Radar indicates\nprecise locations!
There is a book titled “Shortcut\nto the Underground.”\c
Which page would you like to read?
Flags: A Flag can be found in every\nSecret Base.\cCapture a friend's Flag and take it\nto your own Secret Base to make\rimprovements to it!\cFind your friends' Secret Bases and\ncapture their Flags!\c
Spheres: In the underground tunnels,\nyou can dig up pretty stones that\rare called Spheres.\cThere are people underground that\ntreat Spheres like money.\cTrade them your Spheres in exchange\nfor decoration goods and other items.\cThese Spheres also have the strange\nproperty of growing if they are\rburied in the ground.\c
Traps: There are Traps that can be\nput down in the underground tunnels.\cThere are many kinds of Traps for\nunwary Trainers under the ground.\cSome Traps need to be blown away.\nSome need to be removed by touch.\c
Goods: These are furniture and\ndecorative items for Secret Bases.\cCollect goods by exchanging Spheres for\nthem, or by getting gifts from friends!\c
Treasure: These are rare items that\nappear while digging underground.\cThey can be taken out of the\nUnderground if placed in your Bag\rwhile in the tunnels.\cDig around all over and find\nTreasure!\c

But that Team Galactic...\cI thought they were just an\neccentric bunch of freaks...\cYou know, talking about how they're\ngoing to make a new universe and all.\cAnd that weird way they dress, too.\nI thought they were harmless.\cIt appears as if they're a lot more\ntrouble than I thought...\cI mean, stealing and hoarding\nPokémon... That's just plain wrong.\c
By the way, did you find the ruins\ninteresting at all?\cIf you did, you may want to visit the\nlibrary in Canalave City.\cThey have some ancient books that\nyou might find interesting.\cIt may also be of help to the\ncompletion of your Pokédex.\cI think you ought to go there.\nOK, bye-bye for now!\c

Hello, hello!\nHow, I say, do you do?\cI am the Pokémon Fan Club Chairman!\nIndeed, yes I am!\cWhen you wish to treat your Pokémon\nto a treat, what, I say, do you do?\cIf I may say so, and I will, I feed\nPoffins to my Pokémon!\cAnd why, I say, would I do that?\cBecause the giving of Poffins is\na way of expressing your love!\cFor example! If I were to give a\nSweet Poffin, the Pokémon eating it\rwould become more cute!\cFor example! A Spicy Poffin will add\nto the coolness of a Pokémon!\cIn such ways I say that Poffins have\nnothing but goodness for Pokémon!\cTherefore!\cI declare this Poffin Case to be\na gift from me to you!\c
I urge you to fill it with Poffins\nand be generous in dispensing them\rto your Pokémon!
Nationwide, there are other fan\nclubs, but we are number one!\cAnd why are we number one?\nBecause I brag more than anyone!\cBut now I can't brag as much...\cPeople started complaining, so\nI've had to curtail my bragging...

Hi!\nLet's get cooking!\cHere's my advice on cooking tasty\nPoffins for your Pokémon crew!\cIn the beginning, while it's still\na batter, swirl it gently and avoid\rspillage.\cWhen it starts to harden, churn it\nfast in big circles!\cAt the end, make a wish for it to\nturn scrumptious and whirl it!
Have you got some Berries?\cTo make delicious Poffins, the key\ningredient is a rare Berry.\cAnd, the more cooks you have,\nthe more delicious the Poffin!
Eating good food makes people and\nPokémon more energetic and happy.\cIn that sense, we're exactly alike.

Hello.\nI'm pleased to meet you.\cI'm Maylene, and I'm the Gym\nLeader.\cI don't really know what it means to\nbe strong, or how I got to be the\rGym Leader.\cBut I will do the best I can as the\nGym Leader.\cI take battling very seriously.\nWhenever you're ready!\c
...OK.\nYou win.\cThat was a tough loss.\nI learned a lot from it.\cPlease, accept this Gym Badge.\c
[VAR 0103(0000)] received\nthe Cobble Badge from Maylene.
Um...\nI should explain about that Badge.\cIf you have that official Pokémon\nLeague Badge, you can use the hidden\rmove Fly outside of battle.\cOh, and please take this as well.\c
That [VAR 0108(0000)] contains\nthe move [VAR 0106(0001)].\cUm... That move inflicts damage,\nand it robs the target's HP.
Gee, I'm hungry...\cOh, sorry, it's nothing.\nI didn't say anything.\c[VAR 0103(0000)], I can't explain what\nit means to be strong.\cI don't know how much effort goes\ninto being strong...\cBut being with Pokémon lets us\nkeep making the effort, doesn't it?
Hey, there!\nHow's it going, Champ-to-be?\cThe Gym Leader is a user of\nFighting-type Pokémon.\cShe'd be a terror against Normal-type\nPokémon.\cBut! And it's a big but!\nJust between you and me...\cMaylene, the Gym Leader, said Flying-\nand Psychic-type Pokémon could be\rreal trouble for her!

Welcome to the Veilstone Game Corner!\c
Did you want some Coins for the\nslots?\cOh, I'm sorry, you don't have\na Coin Case to hold your Coins.
Did you want some game Coins?\cIt's $1000 for 50 Coins.\nWould you like some?
Thank you very much!\nHere are your Coins!
Um... You don't appear to have\nenough money...
Oh?\nYour Coin Case is full.
Oh... You don't need Coins, then?\nPlease come again!
Ten straight bonus rounds on\nthe slots! That's amazing!\cI would say you had an explosion\nof good luck!\cSo, please take this Technical Machine\nas a memento!\c
Please keep playing the slots for\nanother explosion of good luck!
Oh, your Bag is full...\nWe will hold the TM for you.
You can't play if you don't have\na Coin Case.
I'll explain how the slot machines\nwork at this Game Corner.\cDuring regular play, you should\nstop the reels from the left.\cDuring the bonus round, watch\nwhere CLEFAIRY points and stop\rthe reels in that order.
Hey, kid, if you want to play here,\nyou need a Coin Case.\cI think the young man next door\nhad one.
I've been winning a ton today.\nHere, take some Coins!\c[VAR 0103(0000)] received 20 Coins\nfrom the man.\c[VAR 0103(0000)] put the Coins away in\nthe Coin Case.
Listen, when CLEFAIRY appears, that's\nyour chance to line up sevens.\cLine those babies up and you're into\nthe bonus round!
Woohoo! CLEFAIRY! Look at it!\nIt's driving me bananas!\cOh, if only you had a Coin Case!\nThen you'd know what fun this is!
Woohoo! CLEFAIRY! Look!\nYeahah! It's a carnival!\cLet me share some of my joy with\nyou!\c[VAR 0103(0000)] received 50 Coins\nfrom the man.\c[VAR 0103(0000)] put the Coins away in\nthe Coin Case.
Woohoo! CLEFAIRY! It's adorable!\nJust seeing it gets my pulse racing!\cOh, let me impart a piece of advice\nto you!\cIf the moon turns red, you don't\nwant to get a replay because it\rmakes CLEFAIRY tired!
I want Coins, of course, but\nsetting records is hot, too!
When a Poké Ball appears, it's a\nchance to line up slot marks.\cReplays and PIKACHU line up even if\nyou don't make an effort.\cBut you need to aim for better marks,\nlike Poké Balls and Moon Stones.
A friend in my group scored a ton\nof Coins here.\cI'm going to challenge him!
Sigh...\nNothing's going my way today...\cAre you a Trainer?\nDid you battle the Gym Leader?\cShe happens to be my daughter.\nShe's some kind of tough!
Shoot for 10!\nLine up those bonus rounds!\cIf you accomplish the feat of completing\n10 uninterrupted bonus rounds,\rplease go to the counter.\cYou will be presented with a fabulous\nprize!\cThe current record sits at\n[VAR 0134(0000)] straight bonus rounds!

Cynthia: One look at you tells\nme many things about you.\cTogether, you and your Pokémon\novercame all the challenges you\rfaced, however difficult.\cIt means that you've triumphed over\nany personal weaknesses, too.\cThe power you learned...\nI can feel it from you.\cThat's enough talking.\nLet's get on with why you're here.\cI, Cynthia, accept your challenge as\nthe Pokémon League Champion!\cThere won't be any letup from me!\c

[VAR 0103(0000)]: Oh, hey, [VAR 0103(0001)]!\nWhat took you so long?\rI'm fining you $100 million!\cListen up. I'm going to become\nthe greatest Trainer ever.\cThat's why I'm here--to toughen\nup myself and my Pokémon!\c
Hehehe! Sorry!\nI couldn't help overhearing that.\cBut the greatest Trainer ever?!\nThat's going to be really tough.\rBecause you're talking about me!\cTo prove that, I'm going to the\nvolcano right now.\cYou look puzzled. You really don't\nknow anything, do you?\cAll right, I'll tell you.\nThis is the Battle Zone, OK?\cAt the far end, there's a volcano.\cAnd deep inside the volcano, there's\nsupposed to be a treasure.\c
[VAR 0103(0000)]: So?\nWhat's the big deal?\cIf I find that treasure first, that'll\nmake me the greatest Trainer ever?\cThat's what I'll do, [VAR 0103(0001)]!\nAnd you too, stranger!\rI'm gonna get the treasure first!\cBut before that, I'm going to the\nBattle Tower! See ya!\c
That guy...\nHe can't stay still, can he?\c
Anyways, howdy, I'm Buck.\nSheesh, that punk can't beat me.\cSo, do you know that zippity-doodah\nof a Trainer?\cYou should chase after that guy\nand tell him not to underestimate\rthe volcano.\cOh, but you know what?\cYou'd better shape up at the\nBattle Tower first, too.\cI don't like your chances of getting\nto the volcano, otherwise.\cBe seeing you!\c
Howdy, Trainer!\nYou have a Pokédex, do you?\cI bet the person who gave you that\nis waiting for you to fill that\rPokédex completely.
Howdy, Trainer!\nYou have a Pokédex, do you?\cHere's my advice: go out and\nchallenge other Trainers!\cThey'll often have different Pokémon,\nso your Pokédex should fill up fast!
The way the Battle Tower looms...\cIt really is a wall that stands\nbefore every Trainer.
I've battled many Trainers over\nthe years.\cI've gained some confidence in my\nskill levels, too.\cBut the world is still a huge place.\nIt's not easy to win in life!
Because of the volcano, the land\naround here is craggy.\cThe rough terrain and all the ups\nand downs make it hard to hike.
The Pokémon League's Elite Four\ncome here sometimes!
Your Pokémon are from Sinnoh,\naren't they?\cThey're not what we're used to\nseeing around here.
There's no end to becoming tough!\cI just made that up, but it sounds\nkind of cool, huh?
What's up? Do you want to sail to\nSnowpoint City?
Aye, right!\nIt's anchors aweigh, then!\c
Oh, right. You'd rather just fly\neverywhere in some big hurry.
Whenever I go to a new place, I get\nexcited over what I might discover.\cBut places I've visited before...\cEven those places thrill me with\nnew discoveries!
Hmm!\nA Super Rod is really good!\cWouldn't you agree?
Hmm!\nWe're of identical minds!\cHmm!\nTake this [VAR 0108(0000)]!\c
Wherever there's water, try your\nluck at fishing.
Don't you like to fish?
What's that?\nAny advice for fishing?\cWell, I'll tell you.\nIt's all about the rod and technique!

[VAR 0103(0000)]: ...!\nIt's OK, though.\c[VAR 0103(0001)], the tougher you get,\nthe tougher we can get, too.\cThere's no end to Pokémon.\nThat's what I'm saying, [VAR 0103(0001)].

Welcome to the Battle Park!\cIt's your first time, isn't it?\nPlease step this way.\c
Since this is your first visit, you\nneed to be given a Point Card.\cPoint Cards are used only in\nthe Battle Park.\cHere you go.\c
If you need information on the Point\nCard, please ask the receptionist\rnext to me.\cI'm the one to ask if you need any\ninformation on the facilities here\rin the Battle Park.\cFor information on the battle rules\nused at the Battle Park, please ask\rthe receptionist across from me.\c
Welcome to the Battle Park!\cIf you need any information on the\nfacilities, I'm the one to ask.\c
What would you like me to explain?
The Battle Park is a place where\nTrainers may enjoy battles.\cThere are two facilities in\nthe Battle Park: the Exchange Service\rCorner and the Battle Tower.\c
The Exchange Service Corner is the\nbuilding that looks like a castle.\cThere, you may exchange the BP\n(Battle Points) you've earned for\ritems.\cFabulous prizes are offered, so\nplease do visit the Exchange Service\rCorner when you save up BP.\c
The Battle Tower is the building\nat the back of the Battle Park.\cThe tower has four sets of Battle\nRooms for different kinds of battles.\cThe Single Battle Rooms are for\nconducting one-on-one battles.\cThe Double Battle Rooms are for\ntwo-on-two battles.\cThe Multi Battle Rooms are for\ntag team battles with a partner.\cThe Wi-Fi Battle Rooms are for\nbattling other Trainers from around\rthe world.\c
Welcome to the Battle Park!\cI can explain how the Point Card and\nthe BP (Battle Points) work.\c
What would you like me to explain?
Every Trainer visiting the Battle Park\nis provided with a Point Card that\rconfirms their challenger status.\cThe Point Card stores BP (Battle\nPoints) that you earn from battling\rin the Battle Tower.\c
BP, short for Battle Points, are used\nonly in the Battle Park.\cYou will earn BP by hitting certain\nperformance targets battling at\rthe Battle Tower.\cThe BP can be traded for prizes at\nthe Exchange Service Corner.\c
Welcome to the Battle Park!\cI can give you a rundown of the\nbattle rules that are used at\rthe Battle Tower.\c
What would you like me to explain?
In the Battle Tower, you may enter\nPokémon in battles that are capped\rat Lv. 50.\cPokémon up to Lv. 50 may be entered\nwith a few exceptions.\cPokémon above Lv. 50 may also be\nentered, but their level will be\rcut to Lv. 50 in the Battle Tower.\cThe reduced level will be restored\nwhen you leave the Battle Tower.\cPlease keep in mind that your\nopponents will not use Pokémon below\rLv. 50.\c
Excluding Eggs and certain exotic\nPokémon, virtually every species of\rPokémon may enter the Battle Tower.\cPlease be aware that the number of\nPokémon you may enter will depend\ron the course you challenge.\cYou are also permitted to take only\none of each kind of Pokémon into\rthe Battle Tower.\c
Your Pokémon may not be holding the\nsame kind of item in the Battle\rTower.\cPlease be sure the Pokémon entering\nthe Battle Tower are all holding\rdifferent items.\c
Good luck!

The Battle Zone used to attract only\nthe hardiest of the Trainers.\cThey were considered eccentric for\ngathering at a place like this.\cIt's hard to believe how much it's\nchanged since then.\cPlaces like the Fight Area and the\nSurvival Area just seemed to spring\rup overnight.

What?! No way!\nYou have the key?\cLocking the door was meaningless!\nI am the loser in this after all!\cThis is no time for self-pity!\nI've got to alert the Commander!\c
My Pokémon can't battle anymore.\cThey're gonna take away my Pokémon\nfor messing this one up...\cHumph! Just you wait!\nOur Commander will smoosh you!
I'm one of Team Galactic's three\nCommanders.\cWe've been trying to create a new\nworld that's better than this one...\cBut people have shown little\nunderstanding about what we do.\cYou don't understand either, do you?\nIt's a little saddening...\cSo, let's have a battle to decide\nwhat we should do next.\cIf I win, you leave.\cIf you win, we, Team Galactic, will\nleave!\c
Oops!\nI messed that one up!\cThat's all right, though.\nI quite enjoyed our battle.\cI guess it's time to say good-bye\nand leave for the time being!\c
Team Galactic...\cThey were saying they had to gather\nPokémon and energy no matter what.\cIt was for creating a new universe,\nor so they claimed.\cNothing they said made any sort\nof sense to me.\cI can't tell you how grateful\nI am for saving me.\cI can finally see my little daughter\nagain!\c
Little girl: Papa!\cYuck! Papa, you're stinky!\nGo shower now, stinky!\c
Papa: Oh, sorry! Ahaha!\nThey had me working nonstop!\c
Little girl: Thank you, Trainer!\nYou made those bad people go away!\cI think the balloon Pokémon will\ncome visiting again!
Papa: Oh, yes, a balloon Pokémon\nappears in front of the windworks.\cIt's always a certain day of the\nweek, but I'm not sure which day.\cCould its appearance have something\nto do with this windworks\rusing wind-generated energy?
The Valley Windworks uses turbines\nto capture energy from winds driven\rfrom the mountains in this canyon.\cWe produce energy from the power of\nnature itself. It's quite wonderful.
If the balloon Pokémon came,\nthe wind would blow it away!

Some say the universe originated\nfrom a massive explosion.\cSimilarly, Sinnoh is thought to have\nbeen formed by an explosion in\rancient times.\cNeedless to say, the explosion came\nfrom the power of a Pokémon.\cThe Pokémon must have been the\nmythical creature considered\ra deity by the ancients.\cOur aim is not to capture the\nmythical Pokémon, but to obtain its\rpower...\cThe PC entry ends there...\c
The mythical Pokémon...\cAccording to myths, the Pokémon\ncreated Sinnoh with its power.\cHowever, capturing the Pokémon with\na Poké Ball prevents it from using\rits full power...\cBut with the Red Chain, the Pokémon\ncan be shackled, and its power can\rbe used without restraint...\cThe PC entry ends there...\c
The Red Chain...\cThe Pokémon of the three lakes and\nMt. Coronet are somehow connected.\cCapturing the Pokémon of the lakes\nwill free the Pokémon of Mt. Coronet.\cFrom the Pokémon of the lakes,\ncrystals can be extracted to create\ra Red Chain.\cUsing that Red Chain, the mythical\nPokémon can be summoned and shackled\rto do as we command...\cThe PC entry ends there...\c

Rowan: Ah, [VAR 0103(0000)]!\nWhat timing!\cThose Team Galactic scoundrels are\nafter the legendary Pokémon!\c[VAR 0103(0000)], help us!\nYou've got to help Lucas!
Rowan: How dare you!\nYou misguided thugs!\c
[VAR 0103(0000)]!\nDawn needs your help!
Rowan: How dare you!\nYou misguided thugs!\c
[VAR 0103(0000)]!\nLucas needs your help!
Ow! Ouch!\nWhat's with this old-timer?
Dawn: [VAR 0103(0000)]!\nIt's T-Team Galactic!\rOh no! The Pokémon of the lake...
Lucas: It's Team Galactic!\nThey took the Pokémon of the lake...
Mars: That face...!\nIt brings back bad memories!\cI'm talking about the windworks!\cI caught a whole lot of trouble\nfor that little incident.\cWhat's with that look on your face?\nYou do remember me, don't you?\cFine, whatever.\nI'll tell you who I am again!\cI'm Mars, one of Team Galactic's\nCommanders.\cSo, what is it? Are you some\nlovey-dovey couple to the rescue?\cNot a chance! Not even a teeny one!\nYou're all going down!\c
I lost again...\cSo, first the windworks, and now\nLake Verity that I owe you for!\cThis shouldn't be happening to Team\nGalactic's Commander...\c...Calm down, Mars...\nI've done my part in all of this...\cMy mission was to transport the\nlake's Pokémon to our HQ...\c...That's right! I accomplished my\nmission without a problem!\c
Team! We're pulling out!\nThe boss is waiting at the HQ!\c
The Pokémon of the three lakes are\nconnected somehow.\cThanks to Saturn's grandstanding at\nLake Valor, a cavern appeared here.\cIt was the cavern where the Pokémon\nMESPRIT slept.\cMESPRIT appeared, too, probably to\ngo help its friends.\cThat worked out well for us.\nIt was super easy to catch.\cSo, now we've got them all:\nMESPRIT, “the Being of Emotion.”\rAZELF, “the Being of Willpower.”\rUXIE, “the Being of Intelligence.”\cNow that we have them all...\cYou can look forward to what plans\nTeam Galactic has for them!\c
Rowan: I see...\nThis also occurred at Lake Valor...\cAnother legendary Pokémon was taken\naway by Team Galactic...\cBoth of you went up against\nfull-fledged criminals...\cThe fact that you're unharmed is\nreason enough to celebrate.\c...But what about Lake Acuity?\nIs [VAR 0103(0000)] safe?
Rowan: [VAR 0103(0000)], I need you to\ngo to Lake Acuity right away.\cI'm worried about [VAR 0103(0001)].
Dawn: [VAR 0103(0000)], what is Team\nGalactic up to?\cAre the abducted Pokémon of the\nlakes going to be OK?
Lucas: [VAR 0103(0000)], what's Team\nGalactic up to?\cThey'd better not harm the Pokémon\nthey took from the lakes...

Kyauun.\c
MESPRIT flew off somewhere...\c
Rowan: ...\n...\c[VAR 0103(0000)], that was MESPRIT,\nwasn't it?\cYou've accomplished what I'd asked\nyou to do at the Canalave Library...\cI asked you to get data on the\nPokémon of the lake, and you did.\cBut it didn't provide any answers\nabout the mysteries of evolution.\cI still don't know why some Pokémon\nevolve and others don't.\cUltimately, it only deepened the\nmystery.\cBut having mysteries to solve...\nThat adds to my enjoyment!\c
[VAR 0103(0000)], why don't you chase\nafter MESPRIT?\cTo me, it seemed as if it wanted to\nplay with you.\cIf you were to use the Pokétch app\nMarking Map, you'd be able to\rtrack the movements of Pokémon.\c
What?\nYou don't have the Marking Map?\c...You should occasionally pay visits\nto the Pokétch Company, you know.\c
Go on, [VAR 0103(0000)].\cI'm sure that you will keep meeting\ncountless Pokémon and people.\cThose encounters will keep thrilling\nyou in their own special ways.\cI hope you'll enjoy that experience!\nTake care, [VAR 0103(0000)].\c

That's a big globe, eh?\cWhere do I live on it now?\nLet's see if I can point it out...

All I need to do is leave a Pokémon\nhere to trade.\cWho knows, it might be traded while\nI'm asleep tonight.
You can easily trade Pokémon with\nPokémon fans from around the world.\cIsn't that something?
You can register where you live on\nthis giant globe.\cOnce you do, your location will\nbe displayed to anyone you\rcommunicate with.

Rowan: Ah, [VAR 0103(0000)]!\cYou've come to show me the progress\nyou've made on your Pokédex?
Hmm...\cYou've spotted [VAR 0134(0000)] Pokémon in\nSinnoh...\c
What's wrong?\cYou're not suggesting you've seen so\nfew that you're afraid to show me?
Rowan: You're working hard on your\nNational Pokédex I see.\cI expect big things from you!
I see!\cYou've met all the Pokémon there\nare in Sinnoh!\c[VAR 0103(0000)], I need to see you\nat my lab. I'll be waiting!
I see!\cYou've met all the Pokémon there\nare in Sinnoh!
Look harder for wild Pokémon.\cDon't be afraid of going into tall\ngrass.
Your pace is picking up.\nThings can only get better!
Be persistent when you're searching\nfor Pokémon that appear only in\rcertain places.
Pokémon aren't hiding only in\ntall grass.\cYou can find many others in caves\nand seas.
Your Pokédex is looking more and more\nrespectable!
Are you fishing with rods?\cPokémon that live underwater need\nto be caught by fishing.
The Trainers that challenge you to\nbattle have Pokémon, obviously.\cThey may have rare ones with them,\nand that can add to your Pokédex.
Your Pokédex is well on the way to\nbeing filled up.\cThis Pokédex can be considered\na journal of your adventure.
You're not far from seeing every\nPokémon there is to see in Sinnoh!
Oak: Ah, [VAR 0103(0000)]!\cYou've come to show me how\nyour Pokédex is coming along?
Oak: Ah, [VAR 0103(0000)]!\cYou've come to show me how\nyour Pokédex is coming along?
Hmhm...\nYou've caught [VAR 0134(0000)] so far...\c
I see...\cCome see me if you'd like me to have\na look at your Pokédex.
They say there are at least 400\nspecies of Pokémon nationwide.\cIf you're planning to catch them all,\nyou'd better be a committed Trainer.
Hm! Little by little, you're filling\nthe Pokédex with complete\rdata on Pokémon you've gotten.\cKeep up the good work!
Here's a tip on catching Pokémon\nin the wild.\cMinimize their HP before you throw\nout your Poké Ball to catch 'em.
Remember: If you can't catch them,\nyou can always trade for them.\cAs soon as you trade, the Pokémon's\ndata is added to the Pokédex.\cThat's why you should seek out\nas many trades as possible.
Have you visited the Great Marsh?\cSome Pokémon only appear in places\nsuch as that.
As you know, there are Pokémon\nthat eventually evolve.\cThat's an important thing to consider\nwhen you're filling your Pokédex.
You've proven yourself capable.\nThere's nothing to worry about.\cKeep catching Pokémon the way you've\nbeen doing so far.
Are you aware that there is more\nthan one style of evolution?\cThere are some Pokémon that evolve\nby becoming friends with the Trainer.
Apparently, there are some Pokémon\nthat appear in swarms on occasion.\cDon't miss out on these massive\noutbreaks of Pokémon!
Amazing! You've already gotten over\n300 Pokémon!\cThat's already a major achievement,\nbut I know you're capable of more!
Some wild Pokémon only appear during\ncertain times of the day.\cYou'll need to look for Pokémon\naround the clock.
I've been getting reports of\ndifferent Pokémon sightings.\cBy different, I mean Pokémon that\naren't native to the Sinnoh region.\cYou should perhaps go back to\nareas you've already scoured.\cYou may end up seeing Pokémon\nthat weren't there before.
[VAR 0103(0000)], have you visited\nthe Pal Park recently?\cThere still may be Pokémon that are\nrarely seen in Sinnoh.
[VAR 0103(0000)], have you visited\nthe Pal Park recently?\cThere still may be Pokémon that are\nrarely seen in Sinnoh.
Hm! Your Pokédex is getting closer\nto completion.\cHave you ever considered a career\nas a Pokémon professor?
Hmm... You've caught quite the\nimpressive collection of Pokémon.\cYou've obviously had to employ many\nmeans to seek them all out.\cKeep an eye out for rustling tall\ngrass and search it thoroughly.
I can only marvel at the diversity\nof Pokémon.\cI'm still very much in awe of\nthem.
Good, good, you're getting close to\ncompleting the Pokédex.\cI'm looking forward to seeing its\ncompletion.\cWhen that happens, your views about\nPokémon will likely have changed!
Hmm... You are so very close to\ncompleting your Pokédex.\cThink about what's missing.\nRecall what you've overlooked.\cYou're so close--please finish\nthe Pokédex!
[VAR 0103(0000)]!\nYou've finally done it!\cYou've finally completed\nthe National Pokédex!\cThis is better than meeting any\nexotic Pokémon for the first time!\cI feel blessed to have become friends\nwith a Trainer like you!\cSincerely, I thank you from the\nbottom of my heart!

...Pant...pant...\c...Why am I running like this\nanyway?!\cThat new universe that the boss\nwas talking about...\cIt's giving me goose bumps thinking\nabout it... So, we use this...\c
Gweh! You were eavesdropping!\nI was only talking to myself!\cYou're persistent, too...\nI'm pooped out from all the running...\cBut, I'm not...\nGoing to battle you...\c
Aww, no...\nYou're still on my tail...?\rThe lake's within sight...\cYou leave me no choice...\nMy Pokémon will KO you...\c
I can't battle anymore...\nI'm running on fumes...\cI'll have to give this to the\nCommander...\cI wish...\nI got to use it at the lake...\c
Cynthia: Oh, hello, long time no see!\nHow is your Pokédex filling up?\cI came to research the folklore\nabout the lake, but...\cWell, it doesn't appear as if the\nlake is open to the public now.\cHave you heard the folklore about it?\cThey say there is an island inside\nthe lake.\cAnd inside that island is a mirage\nof a Pokémon.\cNo one must enter the chamber\nof that Pokémon...\cSorry to change the subject, but\nhave you seen the group of PSYDUCK\ron Route 210?
Cynthia: Yes, that's right.\nBy the cafe on Route 210.\cYou've seen that group of PSYDUCK\nhuddled with their heads in their,\ruh, hands...?\c
Cynthia: You haven't seen them?\nBy the cafe on Route 210.\cThere's a group of PSYDUCK huddled\nwith their heads in their, uh,\rhands...?\c
Anyway, what you should do is use\nthis medicine on the PSYDUCK.\cYou're working on a Pokédex, so it\nwould be worthwhile for you.\c
Cynthia: I went on a big adventure\nwith a Pokédex when I was younger.\cI hope you get to meet every kind\nof Pokémon there is to see.\cIt may help you with the secret of\nthe mirage Pokémon.\cSee you later!\c
We've been asked to keep everyone\nout of the lake area.\cReason? I'm not too sure, but\napparently to protect the lake.
To protect the lake...\cIt's nice to know there are still\npeople worth admiring like that.\cI believe his name was Cyrus?
Stop, stop!\nYes, you!\cSunyshore City, which is down this\nroad, had a major blackout!\cCrews are working on restoring\npower, but the road's closed now.\c

Seven Stars Restaurant\nMore Flavor Than You Can Wish For
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Text File : 355
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
At our restaurant, you can enjoy\nmore than just exquisite dining.\cYou may also partake in battles.\nBon appetit!
I am so sorry.\nWe are now closed.\rPlease do visit while we are open.\c
Before we make our toast, I'd hoped\nfor a battle...\cHowever, you seem to be short\na Pokémon for that.
If you want to have a battle with us,\nyou'll need to bring more Pokémon.
With someone as beautiful as you for\nmy model, I am sure to paint\ra masterpiece!\c
What is it?\nDo you wish for a battle?\c
                                               
Though we lost our battle...\nA toast to your beauty, that no\rpainting could ever hope to capture!
He said he'd treat me to a dinner\nhere if I agreed to model for him.\cSo, I came along, but I haven't\nmade up my mind yet.\c
When I can't decide, I battle\nto make the decision!\c
                                                           
I've decided to model for him.\nThat's given me an appetite!
There is no price too high for the\nsake of my art...\cThat said, my oh my, these meals\nlook awfully pricey...\c
What is it?\nAre you feeling hungry, too?\cOh, I see, that's not it!\nYou wanted a battle!\c
                                           
My hors d'oeuvres have gone cold...
I have to slow down on eating these\ndelicious hors d'oeuvres.\cI don't want to be all bloated by\nthe time the main dish comes.\c
I'd like a light battle to work up\nmy appetite.\cWould you care to join us?\c
                                                                  
The hors d'oeuvres haven't grown\ncold...\cThese are supposed to be served\nchilled!
The worth of a meal isn't determined\nmerely by its flavor.\cPresentation, that is, color and\nplacement, is vital.\cIn other words, a fine meal can be\nlikened to the finest work of art...\c
And in Pokémon battles, I also hope\nto see beauty.\cYou do agree with me, yes?\c
                                                                                                 
The meals prepared here are not\nmerely tasty, they are also healthy.\cDiners need not worry about ruining\ntheir figures eating here.
Today's main dish is scrumptiously\ndelicious!\cIf I can keep eating this food,\nI'll model anytime I can!\c
I feel guilty just eating all\nthis delicious food like this.\cI'll join in the battle, too!\c
                                                              
The models of great paintings were\noften rather plump.\cThat means I can keep eating without\nobsessing over my figure!
If you want to challenge us, bring\nsome more Pokémon.
If you want to battle us, you have\nto have at least two Pokémon!
Actually, my father happens to be\nthe chef here.\c
What is it? A battle?\nBahaha... You think you can beat me?\c
                           
We've lost, but let's make a toast\nto our future together anyway!
Oh, my!\nYour father is the chef here?\cHow wonderful!\c
I haven't told him, but my father\nowns the hotel and restaurant...\cOh, but that's beside the point.\nWould you care for a battle?\c
                                           
Let's make a toast to the prosperity\nof the restaurant!
I have to hand it to my father--\nthese hors d'oeuvres are delicious!\c
...Are you maybe asking me for\na battle?\cWell, certainly!\nI never back down from a challenge!\c
                            
Finally. Now we can go about enjoying\nour meal without disruption.
Yes! This meal is good enough to\nserve at the hotel.\c
Please don't tell my date that my\nfather owns the restaurant.\cI'll have a battle with you if you\nkeep your mouth shut.
                            
My date did his best, but you were\nbetter than the both of us.
Fufufu, my date's really enjoying\nmy dad's cooking.\cShe has a dreamy expression after\nevery bite!\c
I'm feeling great!\nSure, I'll have a battle with you.\cThat's why you approached us, right?\c
                                 
My prowess as a Trainer isn't up to\nsnuff...\cIt's not like my father's scrumptious\ncooking...
This succulent flavor!\nIt reminds me of a world trip I took.\cMy father and I traveled everywhere\ndining at only the best restaurants.\c
Eating this fabulous meal has\nreally lifted my spirits.\cJoin us for a battle?\c
                                                        
Your father's cooking has a very\nmagical quality to it.\cIt seems to perk people up with\nenergy.
If your intention is to test your\nskill on us, I daresay you ought to\rbring at least another Pokémon.
Oh, you're offering to do battle\nwith us? How nice of you.\cUnfortunately, you simply cannot\nbattle us both with just one Pokémon.
Let me propose a toast to many\nmore happy years together.\c
Since I took my retirement, I've been\ntraveling with my wife.\cWe both enjoy searching for delicious\ndining experiences.\cYou seem to enjoy battling with\nPokémon. Am I right?\c
                               
Well, so much for that. Let's try to\nenjoy the rest of our meal.
To our health, welfare, and to fine\ndining! Cheers!\c
A toast before a meal helps stimulate\nthe appetite, I find.\cBut that's neither here nor there.\nYou wanted a battle, surely?
                        
Gourmet dining in restaurants and\nexhilarating Pokémon battles...\cThere is so much contentment in my\nlife!
Hmm!\nNow, this is special!\cIt appears as if it were only grazed\nwith fire, but in reality, much\rcare has gone into its preparation!\c
When you get to be an accomplished\ngourmet like myself, one can tell at\ra glance if a dish is delicious or not.\cYou would battle against such\na discerning gourmet?\c
                                                    
Well, so much for that.\cWe'll keep a stiff upper lip and look\nforward to enjoying the main course.
These hors d'oeuvres are simply\ndivine!\cThey tell me that I can expect the\nmain course to be fantastic!\c
I thought the main course arrived\nalready...\cYou're a Trainer seeking battle?\c
                                                
The hors d'oeuvres were most\nexcellent!
Hmm!\nThe chef flambeed this to perfection!\cThe rich aromas and flavors fill my\nmouth with joy!\c
You're throwing down a challenge\nin the middle of our meal?\cI would say you're a very dedicated\nTrainer, especially for one so young!\c
                                                      
Ah... I'm very satisfied with our\nmeal and our battle.
...!\nThis sauce!\cIt's a spicy sauce in Hoenn style\nmade from grated Cheri Berries!\c
Would you like to sample a bite?\c...\nOh, right. Pokémon?\c
                                              
Battling is fine, of course.\cBut for me, I would rather be out\nenjoying good meals.
If you want to battle us, you\nhave to have two Pokémon.
Don't you have two Pokémon?\nWe'll have to battle another time!
Alison, um, I, er...\nThank you for coming today...\cShould we make a toast?\c
She's the girl from the Pokémon-\ngoods shop I go to all the time.\cWe're incredibly happy together.\nWould you like to battle us?\c
                                                   
Oh, no, I'm sorry we lost.\nAlison, you're not upset?
Fufu... Eugene, you act so different\nfrom the way you do at the shop.\cYou're surprisingly shy.\c
I work at a Pokémon-goods shop\nbecause I love Pokémon.\cThe job lets me be with Pokémon\nall day long.\cIt naturally made me pretty decent\nat battling. Want to try me?\c
                                             
I don't worry much about winning\nor losing.\cI keep my Pokémon with me because\nI love them!
If my Pokémon buddies hear I went\non a date with you, Alison...\cThey're probably going to hate me\nfor it...\c
Are you Alison's fan, too?
                                             
Alison, seeing your smiling face...\cI can't tell if these appetizers\nare delicious or not!
Sorry? What? Date?\cUm... Eugene...\nYou are a valued customer and all...\c
...Even though I said that, I admit\nthe invitation was flattering.\cSo I accepted his invitation.\cI'll let my Pokémon decide for my\nfickle heart. Let's battle?\c
                                            
You know, it is true what they say.\nThere is no evil among Pokémon fans!\cThat goes for you and Eugene!
Looks like our main course is here.\nPlease, enjoy yourself.\cI've got the bill covered today!\c
I'll defeat you and collect the\nprize money!\c
                                                         
My wallet's empty after paying the\nprize money...\cOh, no, it's OK! No need to worry!\nI still have my secret stash of cash!
Eugene, I think you're a little\nawkward, but you're very earnest.\c
If I team up with my date, it could\nbe an interesting combination.\cI think we could battle in an\nintriguing manner. Do you?\c
                                 
The meal was delicious, and our battle\nwas so much fun.\cI really insist that we split the bill.
If you have two Pokémon, I'll take\nyou on with my mom.
I'm willing to have a battle with\nmy son, my pride and joy.\cBut you must bring more Pokémon\nthan that.
What should I have today?\nJuice, ice cream, cake, and, and...\c
Oh, hi, Trainer!\cWant to battle Pokémon with us\nbefore we have a yummy dinner?\c
                                         
I don't get it. Grown-ups always have\na toast before eating.\cWhat's that for?\nAnd I don't see any bread?
My dear, Mommy is so proud of you\nfor doing so well on your test.\cYou may order anything you like.\nIt's your reward, dearest!\c
Did you know? My boy is not only a\ngenius at school, but he's also\ra Pokémon prodigy!\cWould you like to challenge us and\nsee?\c
                                               
I wish to propose a toast.\cMay my darling Esteban get another\n100% on a test!
Wow, they bring out things one dish\nat a time!\cIt's not like how it is at home!\c
I do my homework while eating.\nI can battle anytime!\c
                                               
We're going to eat this delicious\nstuff now. Bye-bye!
This restaurant is the talk of the\ntown for the delicious food.\c
I beg your pardon?\nYou want a battle now?\cWell, that's all right.\nIt's not as if I dislike it.\c
                                 
Thank you for letting my dear son\nexperience an invaluable lesson.
Do mothers and fathers go off to\neat like this?\cI mean without taking their kids\nalong.\c
But that's OK.\cIt's way more fun for me to battle\nthan go eat fancy dinners!\c
                                                  
Mom, you gotta make me this at home!
This is a special occasion, Esteban.\cThis is to celebrate your great\ngrades!\c
Oh? A battle, you say?\nWell, certainly. Why not?\c
                                               
Is the dessert coming soon?
My daughter and I always battle\ntogether, none of that one-on-one.
I can go against you with Papa.\nPlease bring more Pokémon.
Here's a toast for Mom.\nMay she always be healthy!\c
My wife's in the hospital waiting for\nthe baby to arrive.\cSince I can't cook, I came here with\nmy daughter.\cHow would you like a battle with\nus before we eat?\c
                         
The house will be a lot noisier when\nthe baby comes home with Mommy.
I wonder what Mommy will bring home?\nA baby boy? A baby girl?\c
A boy will be a brother, and a girl\nwill be a sister.\cI'm going to be the older sister,\nso I should get better at Pokémon!\c
                            
Little babies cry like Pokémon!\nPiyaaaah!
Wow... Look at these appetizers.\nThis is just so extravagant.\c
I'm no cook, I'll admit that freely.\cBut battling Pokémon... There's\nsomething I'm comfortable with.\c
                            
Let's get over the sting of this loss\nby enjoying this delicious meal!
Wow!\nThis food looks really fancy!\c
Papa is a rotten cook, so we can\ngo out and eat good food like this!\cDid you come to this restaurant to\nbattle Pokémon?\c
               
I've never eaten anything like this\nbefore.
Here's the main dish!\c
What is it?\nDid you want to battle with us?\c
              
Jocelyn, I hope the new baby will be\nas kindhearted as you.
I wish Mommy were here to eat with\nus...\c
Mommy gave me my Pokémon.\nWant to see how tough they are?\c
                            
Next time, let's come with everyone.\nThe baby, too!
Yeah? What's up?\nDid you want to be on TV, too?\cOh, right, sorry!\nYou wanted to battle!\cYou'll be battling the two of us.\nYou need at least two Pokémon.
If you want an autograph, you'll\nhave to wait till we finish filming.\cOh, and if you want to battle,\nbring two Pokémon, OK?
Let's start with a shot of the\ndrinks as a camera test.\c
Hunh? You're inviting us to battle at\na time like this?\c
                                          
Oh, man...\nOur drinks are lukewarm now.
Today's featured drink is freshly\nsqueezed juice made from ripened\rPecha Berries picked this morning!\c
Pardon?\nPokémon?\cOK, a quick one before we do any\nfilming for the show.\c
                                             
Do you think we should rehearse this\none more time?\cToday's featured drink is freshly\nsqueezed...
Hey, these appetizers sure do look\ndelicious.\cWill someone bring me a mist spray\nso they look even fresher?\c
Thanks, that was quick!\c...Wait, where's the mist spray?\nOh, you want a battle?\cWhatever, then.\nI'm up for your challenge!\c
                                                             
Photographing food isn't easy.\nIt's actually very technical.
These look fabulous, too.\nWe need the camera to zoom in more!\c
Please don't talk to me while we're\nfilming!\cOh, actually, hold on.\cA Trainer barges in on our fine\ndining experience...\cI like that!\nIt adds drama to our story!\c
                               
Darling Darryl, are you ready?\cWhen I take a bite, I want\na close-up of my lips, all right?
Whoa...\nSo this is the main dish? Yowza!\cLet's get this filming done quick\nso I can chow down, too!\c
You've been sniffing around a lot...\nAre you messing with our filming?\c
                                          
Oh, no... Everything's gone cold while\nwe were battling...
Chomp!\cMmm... This is...\nLight, and yet rich flavored...\rIt delectably melts away...\rA hint of an aftertaste, yet crisp...\rNeither too sweet nor too bitter...\rMy words can't do this justice!\c
It's not easy trying to describe\nfood while you're eating.\cBut I can battle anytime during\nfilming!\c
                                                                                                   
Do you know what the most important\nthing is for gourmet reporting?\cIt's a...thesauruslike vocabulary!
I'll only say this once, so listen\nclosely. I'll even say it slowly.\cTo battle against two Trainers, you\nneed two or more Pokémon.\cNow if you were to bring more\nPokémon, I could consider a battle...
Oh, you'll have to bring more Pokémon\nthan that to battle us!
And another brilliant day on the\nmarkets! A toast to my Lady Luck!\c
Since I've been with her, I've been\nriding a hot streak on the markets.\cI'm surfing on a wave of good luck!\nYou're sure you want to battle us?\c
                            
This is just a minor setback.\nI can easily make up for this!
Ooh! All your stocks went up again?\nYou haven't guessed wrong yet!\c
My boyfriend's a stock market\nwizard!\cDid you know? Someone that lucky also\nhappens to make a tough Trainer.\cAre you willing to try your luck\nagainst that?\c
                          
It's just one loss. We can make that\nback with a big win next time!
There's no need for technique.\cYou just have to read what's in your\nopponent's heart.\c
When I say “heart,” I don't mean\nwhat that person's thinking. It's\rabout how they want to be perceived.\cDo you... Would you like me to think\nof you as a tough Trainer?\c
                               
I had a bad feeling about this\nTrainer...
No, really? Ooeeeh! That is so neat!\nHow can you tell these things?\c
My boyfriend could tell that deep\ndown, I'm actually a frightened and\rlonely child!\cI don't think I could ever lose with\nhim. Want to try?\c
                            
It's amazing that you predicted you\nwould lose!
Let's savor this extravagant meal\nand think of what it represents.\cWe can use that as motivation to\nkeep winning at life!\c
Personally, I think there are two\nkinds of people.\cThose who face up to challenges\nand those who duck and cover.\cYou're the type who accepts\nchallenges, am I right?\c
                                        
If I had the power of premonition,\nI'd be a terror on the markets.\cBut you know that's not really\npossible.
How can you guess right about\neverything all the time?\cDo you really have the power of\npremonition?\c
I'm convinced that he has some\nextrasensory power or something.\cI'm teaming up with a guy like that.\nAre you sure you want to do this?\c
                                         
If it's not premonition, did you...\nMaybe come from the future?
One Pokémon is insufficient if you\nwant to battle against us.
If you'd bring two or more Pokémon,\nwe could have a battle with you.
Hmm... This beverage's coloration\nborders on the positively toxic...\cHowever, my analysis indicates that it\nis composed of natural ingredients.\c
What is it?\nYou are?\c...\n...Oh, yes, a Trainer.\c
                                                               
The results of that battle are\ninsignificant. Let's drink up.
Oh, dear!\nI wish you wouldn't!\cWe're at a fancy restaurant, and you\nwant to analyze what's served?\c
Oh, you're a Trainer?\c
                                                        
Cheers, dear!\cPlease don't start analyzing what\nwe just drank!
Interesting...\nThese hors d'oeuvres are fascinating.\cPlant fiber 20%, iron 5%, protein 35%.\nCurious and curiouser...\c
What is it now? Do you want me to\nanalyze your skill level?\c
                                                             
I feel compelled to analyze that\nwhich is unknown to me.\cBy defining its composition, I feel\nreassured in my knowledge.
Oh, dear, must you go on that way?\nIt takes the magic out of a meal.\cI wish you wouldn't think about your\nresearch while we're out eating!\c
My husband never ceases to amaze\nme with his dedication to research.\cWould you care to have a battle\nwith us?\c
                                                      
If you were to ask me, I would\nrather not know about what I don't\runderstand. It's simpler that way.
By my calculations, the main dish\nshould have arrived by now.\cPerhaps the thermal setting is too\nlow to prepare the food efficiently?\c
You there!\nLet's battle to consume time!\c
                                                            
They brought the main course while\nwe were battling...\cThe calorie content appears to be\nalarmingly high.
There isn't any point getting\nimpatient over the food, dear.\cIsn't this the sort of situation\nthat you brought your Pokémon for?\c
Oh, what good timing!\cWould you join us for a quick\nbattle?\c
                                                       
Oh, dear, if we take in too many\ncalories, we can always work them off\rby battling!

You haven't caught all your\nPokémon yet, but...\cWould you like to retire from your\nCatching Show?
I see...\cI'm disappointed that you dropped\nout. Make up for it next time!\c
That's the spirit, [VAR 0103(0000)]!\nI like how you don't give up!
That's the spirit, [VAR 0103(0000)]!\nI like how you don't give up!
                                    
Ding-dong!\nCongratulations!\c[VAR 0103(0000)] has successfully\ncaught the stocked Pokémon!\c
                                    
                                      
Would you like to retire?
Let the countdown begin!

[VAR 0103(0000)]: Hey, if we run into a\nPokémon, I'm gonna catch it somehow.\cBecause I'm gonna be a Pokémon\nTrainer.\cYou know what a Trainer does, right?\nMakes Pokémon battle and all that?
[VAR 0103(0000)]: Pokémon all have\ndifferent moves, huh?\cA Trainer makes his Pokémon battle\nby ordering them to use moves.\cThat's so awesomely cool.
[VAR 0103(0000)]: I want Pokémon of my\nown, and not too soon, either.\cI'd be able to go everywhere with my\nPokémon that way.
[VAR 0103(0000)]: That lake has a mirage\nPokémon living in it.\cEveryone says nothing lives there,\nbut I know I'm right.
[VAR 0103(0000)]: I'm gonna become\na Pokémon Trainer for sure.\cNot just any Trainer either.\nI'm going to be the greatest ever.\rThat's my dream.
[VAR 0103(0000)]: Hey, that's enough\ntalking already.\cI'm itching to get going to the lake.\nCome on, come on!
[VAR 0103(0000)]: All right!\nLet's move out! Hustle up!
[VAR 0103(0000)]: We didn't have any\nchoice in using those people's\rPokémon, right?\cBut these Pokémon belong to them...\nThey'll want them back, won't they?\cBut this is the first Pokémon I've\never battled with...
[VAR 0103(0000)]: I wish I could grow\ntougher with this little guy...
[VAR 0103(0000)]: I don't feel like\ntalking... Let's go.\c...Are we maybe walking slower than\nwhen we went to the lake?
Cheryl: Wait!\nPlease wait, [VAR 0103(0000)]!\cIf you use an Escape Rope now,\nyou know that you'll leave me behind?
Cheryl: Wait!\nPlease wait, [VAR 0103(0000)]!\cIf you use Teleport now, you know\nthat you'll leave me behind?
Cheryl: This place...\nThey say it's a haunted mansion...\cI'm sorry, but it's too creepy.\nMay we go, please?
Cheryl: It's startling to see two wild\nPokémon appearing at the same time.
Cheryl: My Pokémon is an excellent\nhealer.\cBut attacking isn't its strong point.
Cheryl: [VAR 0103(0000)], battling with\nyou makes me feel elated.\cIf I could predict what you're about\nto do, we would make a fierce combo!
Cheryl: That's some nice moss...
Mira: Are you going to use that?\nI will be left all alone...
Mira: Are you going to use that?\nI will be left all alone...
Mira: That isn't the right way.\nI'll be lost if we go down...
Mira: I like helpful Pokémon moves\nlike Growl and Minimize.\cThose kinds of moves are my\nfavorites.
Mira: This cave...\nIt's so easy to get confused here.\rDo you know where we are?
Mira: [VAR 0103(0000)], did you get to be\nso good because you're always with\ryour Pokémon?\cYes! That has to be it!\nI will try like you!
Riley: If you use that, I'll have to\nwave good-bye to you now.
Riley: If you use that move, I'll have\nto wave good-bye to you now.
Riley: Haha, I'd have to agree.\cPeople training here would be those\nwith too much time on their hands.
Riley: This used to be a fairly\nthriving ore mine once upon a time.\cI guess the steel ore's played out.\nThere's only Pokémon here now.
Riley: Have you met Byron?\nThe Leader of Canalave Gym?\cHe's asked me to become a Gym\nLeader, but there's his son Roark\rto consider as well.
Riley: Imagine what it would be like\nfor a Steel-type Pokémon user to\rbattle a Steel type.\cWould that be like battling yourself,\nI wonder?\cI mean, it's a lot harder to defeat\none's self than anyone else.
Riley: What's going on here, though?\nThe native Pokémon are restless...\cI don't like this...\nLet's hurry.
Riley: Thanks.\nYou really helped me out.\cListen, I have a Pokémon here\nnamed Luca.\cWould you take it with you?\c
Riley: Thanks!\cI want you to show Luca all sorts\nof worlds.\c
Riley: Thank you...\cBut you don't have room to take\nanother Pokémon.\cAll right, then.\nI'll wait here for you.
Riley: I hope you'll accept it as\na token of our friendship.
Riley: Spending time with you was\nvery enjoyable.\cI intend to test my skills in other\nplaces from now on.\cIt would be great if we could meet\nagain.\c
Marley: ...Are you going to leave\nme here?
Marley: ...Are you going to leave\nme here?
Marley: ...Sorry, but I'm not\ngoing up.
Marley: ...It isn't that way.
Marley: ...You're very chatty...
Marley: ...The Pokémon among\nflowers...
Buck: Whoa, [VAR 0103(0000)]!\cIf you use that, me and my Pokémon\nwill be left behind. Don't do it!
Buck: Whoa, [VAR 0103(0000)]!\cIf you use that, me and my Pokémon\nwill be left behind. Don't do it!
Buck: Why do I like the volcano\nso much?\cI don't really have a good reason\nfor it, but I don't really need one.
Buck: There's no law that says\nI have to be tough or anything,\rbut losing isn't fair to my Pokémon.\cAfter all, they try so hard for me.\cI think it's my responsibility as a\nTrainer to recognize their hard work.
Buck: My big brother's one of the\nElite Four.\cSo, of course it's only normal that\nI'd be better than ordinary folks.\cBut that's not what I want.\nI want to be tough on my own terms.\cIt wouldn't be fair to the Pokémon\nthat chose to be with me.
Buck: It might be cool being a Gym\nLeader or one of the Elite Four...\cBut, then again, it sounds like it'd\nbe a lot of hard work!

[VAR 0103(0000)]: Hey, you saw that news\nreport that was on TV, right?\cYou know, “Search for the Red\nGYARADOS! The mysterious appearance\rof the furious Pokémon in a lake!”\cThat show got me to thinking.\cI'll bet our local lake has a Pokémon\nlike that in it, too!\cSo, that's what we're gonna do.\nWe'll go find a Pokémon like that!
[VAR 0103(0000)]: Hey!\nWhere are you wandering off to?!\cThat mystery Pokémon on TV!\nIt's calling out to me!\cForget about going back home!\c
Remember what your mother said?\cMom: “[VAR 0103(0000)]!\nDon't go into the tall grass!\c“Remember, wild Pokémon may attack\nyou if you're walking in tall grass.\c“It would be OK if you had your\nown Pokémon, but...”
[VAR 0103(0000)]: Hey, it's those people!\nIs that old guy staring at us?\c
Professor: Hmm...\cI heard from [VAR 0103(0000)] that\nyou used our Pokémon?\rLet me see them, please.\cHmm...\n[VAR 0100(0001)] and [VAR 0100(0002)]...\c...\cHmm...\rI see...\nThat's how it is...\c
[VAR 0103(0000)]!\nI'm going back to my lab!\c
Dawn: Um... Yes!\nProfessor, please wait for me!\c
I think you should visit our lab\nlater.\cOK, see you!\c
Lucas: Uh... Yeah, of course!\nProfessor, wait for me!\c
You should visit us at our lab later,\nI think.\cWe'll be seeing you!\c
[VAR 0103(0000)]: What was all that\ncraziness about?\cI mean, if he was angry, he could've\njust yelled at us, or whatever...\cAnd didn't he want their Pokémon\nback...?\c[VAR 0103(0001)]...\nWe should go home, too...\c
Wild Pokémon lurk in tall grass. They\ncan come bursting out at any time.\cSo, if you're wanting to battle wild\nPokémon, just walk in tall grass.\cIf you want to avoid wild Pokémon,\nthen stay out of the tall grass.
Hi!\nI work at a Pokémon Mart.\cDid you know that a Pokémon's health\nis measured by Hit Points (HP)?\cIf a Pokémon runs out of HP, it\nfaints and can't battle anymore.\cIf a Pokémon's HP gets low, you\nshould heal it with a Potion.\cHere, let me give you a Potion as\na free sample. First one's free!\cIt will automatically go in the\nMedicine Pocket of your Bag.\c
You can find a Pokémon Mart in cities\nand most major towns.
That ledge is one way. Jump down\nfor a shortcut to Twinleaf Town!
If your Pokémon's health--that's its\nHP--is getting low, you should go\rhome and get some rest.
If your Pokémon's health--that's its\nHP--is getting low, you should go\rto a Pokémon Center!

Dawn: Oh, that's right!\c[VAR 0103(0001)], I haven't shown you\nhow to catch a Pokémon.\cI'll demonstrate how to catch \none, so just watch me, OK?\c
Dawn: Giggle...\nSee? Isn't it neat?\cActually, it's better to lower your\ntarget's HP more than I did.\cIt's important to get the Pokémon's\nHP down as low as possible.\cThis is because a healthy Pokémon\nis very difficult to catch.\cOh, Pokémon also get easier to catch\nif you make them sleep or something\rby using a Pokémon's move.\cOK, [VAR 0103(0000)], to get you\nstarted, I'll give you five\rPoké Balls!\c
If you have lots of Pokémon with you,\nit will be safer on long trips.\cPlus, it will be a lot more fun\nhaving your Pokémon friends along.\cOK, I need to get going.\nBye, now!\c
Lucas: [VAR 0103(0001)]?!\cDid you tell your family that you're\nhelping the professor?\c...I bet you didn't, did you?\cI know that you're eager to\nsee all kinds of Pokémon.\cBut you shouldn't make your mom\nworry that you've upped and left.\c
Lucas: Why don't you go tell your\nfamily that the professor asked for\ryour help?\cYou should do it right away.\c
Lucas: [VAR 0103(0001)], do you know\nhow to catch a Pokémon?\cI'll demonstrate how to catch\none, so just watch, OK?\c
Lucas: And that's how it's done.\cActually, I should have lowered the\ntarget's HP some more.\cYup, the important thing is to lower\nthe Pokémon's HP as much as possible.\cSee, a healthy Pokémon isn't easy to\ncatch.\cOh, yeah. They also get easier to\ncatch if you make one of your\rPokémon put them to sleep or such.\cHere, [VAR 0103(0000)], I'll give you\nfive Poké Balls to get you started.\c
If you have lots of Pokémon with you,\nyou'll be able to travel farther.\cThat way, you'll have a better shot\nat meeting more Pokémon.\cSee you around!\c
Some Pokémon only appear in the\nmorning. Some only come out at night.\cI'm going to keep waiting right here\ntill I've seen every last one of 'em!

Hi, are you the flirty type?\nI'm asking you this to make a point.\cI teach at the Trainers' School,\nand I'd like to give you a lesson.\cBut before I do, I'd like you to\nhave this TM.\c
You know how Pokémon have genders?\nLike, there are males and females?\cWell, the move Captivate only works\nagainst the opposite gender.\cFor example, it only works when used\nby a male Pokémon on a female.\cThe move sharply lowers the target's\nSpecial Attack, or Sp. Atk for short.\cYou also probably know this, but a\nTM is good for only one use.\cChoose the Pokémon wisely if you\ndo decide to use it.

Dr. Footstep: ...Hmm... [VAR 0100(0000)]\nhappens to be quite the silent type!\cHowever, your [VAR 0100(0000)] and\nyou obviously share a close bond.\rThis is for you.\c
[VAR 0103(0001)] received\nthe Footprint Ribbon.\c
[VAR 0103(0001)] put the Footprint Ribbon\non [VAR 0100(0000)].
Aww... [VAR 0103(0001)] only plays with\nother Pokémon...\c[VAR 0101(0002)] feels neglected...\cMaybe [VAR 0103(0001)] doesn't like\n[VAR 0101(0002)] very much?\c[VAR 0101(0002)] will try harder for\n[VAR 0103(0001)].\cPlease be nicer to me!\c
Others say there are people who\naren't very nice to Pokémon.\cI wonder about [VAR 0103(0001)]...\cWill [VAR 0103(0001)] look after\n[VAR 0101(0002)] nicely?\cWill I get to go all over with this\nTrainer?\cCan we be... Friends?\c
This adventure with [VAR 0103(0001)]\nis lots of fun.\c[VAR 0101(0002)] gets to go places where\nI can't go by myself.\cI get to battle Pokémon I've never\never seen before.\cI'm gonna get stronger and stronger\nfor [VAR 0103(0001)]!\c
[VAR 0101(0002)] and [VAR 0103(0001)] make\na perfectly matched combo!\cI've seen all sorts of people\nso far...\cBut [VAR 0103(0001)] understands\n[VAR 0101(0002)]'s feelings most!\cI'm a little hungry...\nYou can tell, right?\c
If I said there can be friendship\nbetween Pokémon and people, will\r[VAR 0100(0000)]'s friends understand?\cBut if you see [VAR 0103(0001)] and\n[VAR 0101(0002)], you will understand.\cBecause [VAR 0103(0001)] and\n[VAR 0101(0002)] are friends!\c
[VAR 0101(0002)] is bored...\nPlay with me more, more...\c[VAR 0101(0002)] and [VAR 0103(0001)],\nlet's play nicer...\c
Gonna go with [VAR 0103(0001)] all over\nthe place...\cBe nice to [VAR 0101(0002)]...\nWarm and cuddly...\c
[VAR 0101(0002)] get strong, make\n[VAR 0103(0001)] happy.\cRound ones, square ones,\ntriangle ones, wobbly ones...\c[VAR 0101(0002)] wants to see different\nkinds of Pokémon...\c
[VAR 0101(0002)] and [VAR 0103(0001)]\nmake a friendly combo.\c[VAR 0103(0001)]'s feelings, [VAR 0101(0002)]\ncan understand.\c[VAR 0101(0002)]'s feelings, [VAR 0103(0001)]\nunderstands!\c
[VAR 0103(0001)] makes [VAR 0101(0002)]\nvery proud!\c[VAR 0100(0000)] boasts to friends\nabout [VAR 0103(0001)]!\c[VAR 0103(0001)] and [VAR 0101(0002)] are\nbest of friends!\c
Why does [VAR 0103(0001)] use only\nother Pokémon?\cAm I not needed much?\cWould I have been better off if\nI remained in the wild?\cNo, I should give this Trainer\na little more of a chance...\c
Humans can't understand the cries\nof Pokémon, nor our feelings.\cHowever, there are some among us\nthat understand human speech...\cHehehe, [VAR 0103(0001)], you're not bad\nfor a human.\c
If a Pokémon were to travel along,\nit would be limited as to where\rit could go.\cBut traveling with a human, a Pokémon\nwould be able to travel farther afield\rto more distant cities and lands.\cTraveling with [VAR 0103(0001)] has been\nrewarding and reassuring.\cAnd very entertaining...\c
Some wild Pokémon frown upon others\nfor traveling with humans.\cThey jeer that the caught Pokémon\nhave “forgotten the wild.”\cBut that view is mistaken.\cThey have just never met a Trainer\nwho could be a great partner.\cA great partner like [VAR 0103(0001)],\nin other words...\c
[VAR 0103(0001)] is...\nA remarkable human and Trainer.\cThat I can always perform the best\nany [VAR 0100(0000)] possibly can...\cI attribute that entirely to my\npartner [VAR 0103(0001)].\cWhen we travel, I can see wild\nPokémon eyeing us enviously...\c
Does [VAR 0103(0001)] intend to ignore\nme forever?\cGive me more opportunities for me\nto shine...\c
If a Pokémon is treated as a friend,\nit will return the sentiments.\cWe grow fonder of humans that treat\nus with kindness...\cDoes [VAR 0103(0001)] even like\n[VAR 0101(0002)]?\c
Did [VAR 0101(0002)] get stronger?\nWho is responsible for making me so?\cIs it [VAR 0103(0001)]'s doing?\nIs the Trainer owed my thanks?\c
[VAR 0103(0001)] and [VAR 0101(0002)] are\nalike in some ways.\cIn humanspeak, we match up well.\nDoes [VAR 0103(0001)] think so, too?\c
[VAR 0103(0001)] is very impressive,\nespecially for a human.\cThe Trainer lets [VAR 0101(0002)] use\nevery bit of power properly.\cIt is a shame that [VAR 0103(0001)] is\nonly a human...\c
That [VAR 0103(0001)]...\nWhat is that Trainer thinking?\cWhy make me join the team, then call\nupon me for nothing?\cAm I considered useless?\nIs the Trainer regretting having me?\cDoes the Trainer dare disrespect\nthis [VAR 0100(0000)] so easily?\c
I have little understanding of\n[VAR 0103(0001)] as a human...\c[VAR 0103(0001)] may not be too bad,\nconsidering that I, an oft-shunned\r[VAR 0100(0000)], am one of the team...\cThat said, I don't intend to be all\ncheerful around [VAR 0103(0001)]...\c
Our kind prefers to lurk in dark\nand dank places...\cBut being with [VAR 0103(0001)], even\nbright and festive places seem less\rthreatening...\c[VAR 0103(0001)] has a strange\ncharisma...\c
Not for a moment did I think I would\nbe traveling with a human...\cIf my [VAR 0100(0000)] friends were to\nsee me now, they would be shocked.\cOr would they be envious of me...?\c
That [VAR 0103(0001)] is the most\nimpressive of humans.\cIt takes a lot to make me,\n[VAR 0101(0002)], sunny and cheerful!\cAs a show of affection, I should\nchomp down on the Trainer's neck...\cHahaha... Have no fear...\nI was merely joking...\c
Wooooooh...\n[VAR 0101(0002)] has nothing to do...\cKeep me too bored, and I'm liable\nto sneak up and bite...\c
Is there any human that would grow\nto like us [VAR 0100(0000)]?\cWell? Does [VAR 0103(0001)] like\n[VAR 0101(0002)]?\c[VAR 0101(0002)] doesn't like...\nWell, no, maybe not...\c
[VAR 0103(0001)] treats me, [VAR 0101(0002)],\nnicely without being scared.\cBut [VAR 0101(0002)] will be even scarier\nfrom now on.\cThat's what we [VAR 0100(0000)] do...\c
[VAR 0101(0002)] is starting to forget\na little about being in the wild...\cBut [VAR 0101(0002)] isn't feeling sad.\nIt's never boring with [VAR 0103(0001)]...\c
There are no Pokémon that dislike\nhumans...\cOnly humans that dislike Pokémon...\cWe [VAR 0100(0000)] are especially\nshunned...\cBut [VAR 0103(0001)] always treats me\nas a friend and partner...\c
Hnurrrr... Hunh?\nThis is... Where?\c[VAR 0103(0001)]'s house, is this?\nIt's not? Hnurrr...\cIf you don't need me for anything,\ncan I go back to my Ball?\cHnurrr...\c
Hnurrr... Me? Uhm...\nI like to sleep most the time.\rOh, I like to eat, too. That's next.\cBut what I really like is to think.\nI'm a very deep thinker.\cWhen I think about the future of the\n[VAR 0100(0000)] species...\c...Hnurrr...hunh?\nOh, I forget where the time goes.\cHnurrrr...\c
Hnurrr... Me? Uhm...\nThere are lots of kinds of moves.\cI like those Dark-type moves,\noh, and Dragon-type moves, too...\cHow would they be for this\n[VAR 0100(0000)]?\cWill they be for me?\nOr a no, no, no sort of thing?\cHnurrr...\c
Hnurrr... I don't know how to begin\nsaying this...\cI liked living quietly before I met\n[VAR 0103(0001)]. Sssh.\cBut I'm getting to like traveling\nwith [VAR 0103(0001)].\cI think I'm getting sort of funky.\nDo you think I'm sort of funky?\cNo? No funk for me?\nHnurrr...\c
Hnurrr... Me? Uhm...\nOther Pokémon, they say to me...\c“You're not thinking, are you?”\nHow insulting they should say so.\cIt isn't true what they say.\nThink, think, think, I do that.\cAll the time, I think hard how to help\n[VAR 0103(0001)]. I concentrate!\cHnurrr...\c
Hnurrr... I did not know that?\nI really don't? What is this?\rI don't know what to say?\rHnurrr...\c
Hnurrr... Well, I...\nI think I'm motivated.\rAs motivated as the average.\rBut it's not so simple as that.\rHnurrr...\c
Hnurrr... How should I say this?\nWe both look out for each other.\rThat's what we try to do, I think.\rThat is for the best.\rHnurrrr...\c
Hnurrr... How do I say?\nHow should I describe us?\cWe are the sound of both hands\nclapping.\c[VAR 0103(0001)] and I are together\nin synchronicity like twins.\cHnurrr...\c
Hnurrr...\nWhat is left to say, I say?\cWe have come so far now, where can\nwe go but to see this through?\cHall of Fame...\nWords so sweet fall from my mouth.\cHnurrr...\c

Pal Park is a place where you are\ntimed on the catching of six Pokémon.\cYou are provided with six special\nPoké Balls for the challenge.\cParticipating Trainers are required to\nsupply the six Pokémon that are to\rbe caught.\cIf you do not supply the stock of six\nPokémon, you may not participate in\rthe Catching Show.\c...Do you want me to explain anything\nelse?
At the start of the Catching Show,\nyou will be given six Park Balls.\cUse the Park Balls to catch the\nsix Pokémon you provide.\c...Do you want me to explain anything\nelse?
You may make Pokémon migrate from\nKanto or Hoenn to stock your\rCatching Game.\cInsert a Game Boy Advance Pokémon\nRuby, Sapphire, Emerald, FireRed,\ror LeafGreen in the Game Pak Slot.\cWhen your DS is turned on, currently\ncaught Pokémon can migrate from\rthe Game Pak to the DS Game Card.\c...Do you want me to explain anything\nelse?
Pokémon caught in Sinnoh may also\nbe used to stock your Catching Game.\cPlease ask the guy next to me who's\nin charge of stocking Pokémon.\c...Do you want me to explain anything\nelse?
Would you like to take part in\na Catching Show now?

Oh, hold on. You don't have enough\nPokémon for a Catching Show.\cYou'll need to stock us with six\nPokémon to participate.\cYou should make some Pokémon migrate\nfrom Kanto or Hoenn!
Very well, let me explain how things\nwork around here.\cI'll read to you from the Pal Park\nmanual I wrote.
I'm sorry you had to retire.\nWe hope you try harder next time.\cI'll take what Park Balls you\nhave left.\cNext time, please do stay to catch\nall six Pokémon.
Oh, your PC Boxes are filled. You\nhave no room for six more Pokémon.\cYou won't be able to accept them,\neven if you do catch them.\cMake enough room in a PC Box and\ncome back for your Catching Show.

Oh, then it might be fun for you to\ngo for an even better score by\rtrying to catch these six again.\cIf you want to do another Catching\nShow, just come see us!

I came to see [VAR 0103(0000)]'s Catching\nShow with Daddy.\cI hope it starts soon...
Eek! [VAR 0103(0000)]!\nYour Catching Show was fantastic!\cI hope I can become an expert\nTrainer like you one day!
Oh, [VAR 0103(0000)]!\nI hope you do better next time.
[VAR 0103(0000)], my daughter is a big\nfan of yours.\cA day doesn't go by without her\ndemanding we come see Catching Shows.
People come here not only to see\nthe Catching Show.\cWe get to see rare and exotic\nPokémon on top of the catches.\cThe excitement gets me all jacked up!
The current record holder is\n[VAR 0103(0001)] with [VAR 0135(0002)] points.\rCan you top that?
Oh! You've topped 2,000 points!\nYou've earned this, then!\c
Keep working on getting a higher\nscore!
Oh! You've topped 2,500 points!\nYou've earned this, then!\c
Oh! You've topped 3,000 points!\nYou've earned this, then!\c
Oh! You've earned 3,500 points!\nYou've earned this, then!\c
You've set an incredible record!\nThere's nothing left to say!
Your Bag is full.\nYou should come back later.
I've heard Trainers complain that\nrare Pokémon take longer to appear.\cIs it easier to start with common\nPokémon?
The Catching Show...\cIt's a head-on clash of will and\nwits between Trainer and Pokémon.\cI especially look forward to seeing\nPokémon from Kanto and Hoenn.\cBut it tugs at my heartstrings to\nknow they're so far away from home.
Your performance left my heart\naflutter today...\cI must crown you with this...\nCrown.\cOh, before you get the wrong idea,\nit's an Accessory for Pokémon.\c

The only items you ever throw are\nPoké Balls!\cBut is that true?!\nI want people to think about that.\cThat's why I give away the Technical\nMachine Fling.\c
Using that move, the Pokémon hurls\nwhatever item it's holding at the foe.\cThe move's effect depends on what\nitem is hurled.\cRemember, the move Fling fails if the\nPokémon isn't holding anything.
When I first started fishing, catching\nanything made me happy.\cBut those days are long gone now...\cNow I get annoyed if I can't beat my\nrecord by even an inch...
I can't explain it.\nI get more easily agitated at night.

I'm the Day-Care Man.\cWe look after the precious Pokémon\nof other Trainers.\cIf you'd like us to raise your\nPokémon, have a word with my wife.
Ah, it's you!\cWe were raising your Pokémon,\nand my goodness, were we surprised!\cYour Pokémon was holding an Egg!\cWe don't know how it got there,\nbut your Pokémon had it.\cYou do want it, don't you?
Ah, it's you! Good to see you.\nYour [VAR 0100(0000)]'s doing just fine.
Well then, I'll hang on to it.\nThanks!
You have no room for it right now...\nCome back when you've made room.
[VAR 0103(0000)] received the Egg from\nthe Day-Care Man.
You take good care of it.
By the way, I saw your [VAR 0100(0000)]\ncavorting with [VAR 0103(0001)]'s\r[VAR 0100(0002)].\cI may even have seen it receiving\na piece of Mail.
If you want to pick up your Pokémon,\nhave a word with my wife.
Ah, it's you!\nGood to see you!\cYour [VAR 0100(0000)] and [VAR 0100(0001)]\nare doing just fine.\c
I really will keep it.\nYou do want this, yes?
The two seem to get along very well.
The two seem to get along.
The two don't seem to like each\nother much.
The two prefer to play with other\nPokémon more than with each other.
I'm the Day-Care Lady.\nWe can raise Pokémon for you.\cWould you like us to raise your\nPokémon?
Which Pokémon should we raise for\nyou?\c
Fine, we'll raise your [VAR 0100(0000)]\nfor a while.\cCome back for it later.\c
We can raise two of your Pokémon.\nWould you like us to raise another?
Ah, there you are!\nMy husband was looking for you.
Oh, fine, then.\nCome again.
You don't have enough money...
Do you want to take back the other\none, too?
Very good.\nCome again.
Ah, it's you! Good to see you.\nNow, about your Pokémon...\c
By level, your [VAR 0100(0000)] has\ngrown by about [VAR 0133(0001)].\c
Your Pokémon team is full.\nMake room, then come see me.
Which Pokémon will you take back?
If you want your [VAR 0100(0000)] back,\nit will cost $[VAR 0135(0001)].
Excellent!\nHere's your Pokémon.\c
[VAR 0103(0001)] took [VAR 0100(0000)] back\nfrom the Day-Care Lady.\c
Oh? But you only have one\nPokémon with you.\cYou can't go off without a Pokémon.\nCome back another time.
Do you want your Pokémon back?
If you leave me that Pokémon,\nwhat are you gonna battle with?\cCome back another time.
Huh? Now, now.\cIf you leave that Pokémon with\nme, you'll be left with just one.\cYou will be better off if you catch\nsome more, if I do say so myself.
Now, now.\nThat is merely an Egg!
Fine, we'll raise your [VAR 0100(0000)]\nfor a while.\cCome back for it later.
Huh?

Dawn: Hey, [VAR 0103(0000)]?\nThe professor told me something.\cHe thinks [VAR 0100(0001)] may have\nreappeared at the Spear Pillar...
Dawn: Hi, [VAR 0103(0000)]!\cYou're friends with the elder of\nCelestic Town, aren't you?\cShe told me that she had something\nshe wanted to show you.
Dawn: Hi, [VAR 0103(0000)]!\nMay I see your Pokédex?\c...\cOh, my gosh! You've seen every kind\nof Pokémon in Sinnoh!\cHave you shown your Pokédex to\nProf. Rowan yet?
Dawn: Hey, [VAR 0103(0000)], have you\never chatted with my kid sister?
Dawn: Oh, [VAR 0103(0000)], are you\nacquainted with Bebe?\cShe lives in Hearthome City.\cEvery Trainer should make it a point\nto pay Bebe a visit.
Dawn: Hey! [VAR 0103(0000)], you've got\na Poké Radar?\cWatch for tall grass to rustle wildly\nwhen you use your Poké Radar.\cThat could be a sign that a rare\nPokémon is hiding in there.
Dawn: Hi, [VAR 0103(0000)]!\nHow's your Poké Radar?\cWhen you use it, do you sometimes\nsee more than one patch of tall\rgrass rustling?\cThe patch farther away gives you a\nbetter chance of seeing the same\rkind of Pokémon in a row.\cThat's the feeling I get, anyways.
Dawn: Sometimes a patch of grass\nsparkles when a Poké Radar is used.\cPeople say a different-colored\nPokémon is hiding there!\cCould that be true?
Dawn: So, [VAR 0103(0000)].\cI'm also helping the professor put\ntogether the National Pokédex.\cCatching Pokémon can be really\nchallenging, can't it?\cBut, it's also so much fun!
Dawn: [VAR 0103(0000)]!\c[VAR 0103(0000)], [VAR 0103(0000)],\n[VAR 0103(0000)]!\cCongratulations for completing\nthe National Pokédex!
Dawn: Is today maybe...\nYour birthday, [VAR 0103(0000)]?
Dawn: Giggle...\nCongratulations, [VAR 0103(0000)]!\rAnd many more happy returns!
Dawn: Oh, it isn't?\cI wonder what made me think that\ntoday was your birthday?
Dawn: [VAR 0103(0000)]!\nI heard from the professor!\cCongratulations, Champ!
Lucas: Hey, [VAR 0103(0000)]!\nThe prof told me something cool.\cHe thinks [VAR 0100(0001)] has\nreappeared at the Spear Pillar!
Lucas: Hi, [VAR 0103(0000)]!\cYou know the elder of Celestic Town,\nright?\cShe told me she wanted to show you\nsomething.
Lucas: Hey, [VAR 0103(0000)]!\nLet me take a look at your Pokédex.\c...\cAwesome! You've seen every kind\nof Pokémon in Sinnoh!\cHave you shown this Pokédex to\nProf. Rowan yet?
Lucas: Hey, [VAR 0103(0000)], have you\never seen my kid sister?
Lucas: Hey, [VAR 0103(0000)], have you\nmet Bebe?\cShe lives out in Hearthome City.\cIf you're a Trainer, you owe it to\nyourself to visit her.
Lucas: Hey! [VAR 0103(0000)], you've got\nyourself a Poké Radar, too?\cWatch for tall grass to rustle wildly\nwhen you use that Poké Radar.\cThat's a sign that rare Pokémon\nmay be hiding there.
Lucas: Hi, [VAR 0103(0000)]!\nHow's your Poké Radar working out?\cWhen you use it, do you sometimes\nsee more than one patch of tall\rgrass rustling?\cThe patch farther away gives you a\nbetter chance of seeing the same\rkind of Pokémon right in a row.\cI think that's how it goes.
Lucas: Sometimes a patch of grass\nsparkles when a Poké Radar is used.\cThey say a different-colored\nPokémon is hiding there!\cI wonder if that's true?
Lucas: So, [VAR 0103(0000)].\cI'm also helping the professor out\nwith the National Pokédex.\cCatching Pokémon can be really\nchallenging, can't it?\cBut I also have a ton of fun doing it!
Lucas: [VAR 0103(0000)]!\cWow! I don't know what to say!\nI mean, it's so awesome and all...\cSincerely, congratulations for\ncompleting the National Pokédex!
Lucas: Hey, [VAR 0103(0000)]?\nIs it maybe your birthday today?
Lucas: I thought so!\nCongratulations, [VAR 0103(0000)]!\rYou know, I'm glad we're friends!
Lucas: Huh?\nIt isn't?\cNow, what made me think it was\nyour birthday? Freaky weird.
Lucas: [VAR 0103(0000)]!\nThe professor told me the news!\cCongratulations, Champ!

Professor: ...\cFinally, you've come.\n[VAR 0103(0000)], was it?\cLet me see your Pokémon again.\c
...\cHmm...\nI see...\cThis Pokémon seems to be rather\nhappy.\c
Well well!\cYou've made your Pokémon evolve\nalready?!\c
All righty then!\cI'll give that [VAR 0100(0000)] to you as\na gift.\c
Professor: Now that it's yours, would\nyou like to give it a nickname?
Professor: Hmm, OK, I see...\nAnd you're happy with that nickname?
Professor: Your friend [VAR 0103(0001)]\ntold me what happened at the lake.\cI heard you battled very well,\ndespite it being your first time.\cAnd, from what I can see, there is\na growing bond between you and that\rPokémon, though it is still young.\cThat's why I would like to entrust\nyou with [VAR 0100(0000)].\c
Dawn: I'm so glad that you're kind\ntoward Pokémon!\cIf you weren't, I'd have to...\nOh, I just can't say it...\c
Lucas: Boy, am I glad you're kind\ntoward Pokémon.\cIf you weren't, well...\nI don't even want to think about it.\c
Professor: Er-hem!\nLet's move on to the main topic.\cThere is something I want you\nto do for me.\c
My name is Rowan.\nI study Pokémon.\cFirst of all, I want to know exactly\nwhat kinds of Pokémon live in the\rSinnoh region.\cTo do so, it is necessary to collect\ndata using the Pokédex.\cThis is what I wish to ask of you.\cI want to entrust you with this\nPokédex.\cWill you use it to record data on all\nthe Pokémon in Sinnoh for me?
Rowan: ...\c...\c...\c...\cI can stand here without speaking for\nhours. I'm a very patient man.\cLet me ask you again, [VAR 0103(0000)].\cI want to entrust you with this\nPokédex.\cWill you use it to record data on all\nthe Pokémon in Sinnoh for me?
Rowan: Hm!\cGood answer!\c
[VAR 0103(0000)] obtained\nthe [VAR FF00(0001)]Pokédex[VAR FF00(0000)]!
Rowan: That Pokédex is a very\nhigh-tech device.\cIt will automatically record data on\nevery kind of Pokémon you encounter.\c[VAR 0103(0000)], I ask that you go\neverywhere and meet every kind of\rPokémon in this region!\c
Dawn: I've got one, too!\c
Lucas: I've got the same kind of\nPokédex as you.\c
Rowan: When you walked up Route 201\nwith your Pokémon, what did you feel?\cI've lived for 60 long years.\nEven now, I get a thrill when\cI'm with a Pokémon.\cNow, you should know that there are\ncountless Pokémon in this world.\cThat means there are just as many\nthrills waiting for you out there!\cNow go!\c[VAR 0103(0000)], your grand adventure\nbegins right now!\c
Rowan: Go on!\c[VAR 0103(0000)], your grand adventure\nawaits you!
Dawn: The Pokémon that I used for\nthe first time was [VAR 0100(0001)]!\cIf you would have chosen\n[VAR 0100(0001)] at the lake, we'd\rhave the same Pokémon now!\cNot that it matters, but...\cAnyways, I'm Dawn.\cI also help the professor add pages\nto the Pokédex.\cSo, in a sense, I'm just like you.\cI just got a little head start on\nyou, that's all.\cI'll be happy to teach you things.\nGlad to meet you, [VAR 0103(0000)]!\c
Lucas: The professor asked me to\nhelp, so I'm going to go out and fill\rthe Pokédex pages, too.\cThat makes us comrades working\ntoward the same goal.\cI'll teach you stuff later, OK?\c
I'm [VAR 0103(0000)]'s father.\cI'll be happy to assist you on your\nquest for the professor.\cHahaha. Eh...\nI'm sure we can count on you!

Professor Oak, let me introduce you\nto my young assistant.\cThis youngster has filled every page\nof the Sinnoh Pokédex for me.\c
Oak: Ah, well, very glad to meet you!\nAs you've heard, my name is Oak.\cI've been hearing a great deal about\nyou from Professor Rowan lately.\cHe's been exuberant in praise about\na fantastic young Trainer.\cI see that you live up to--no--that\nyou've surpassed his praise.\cYou've also got an impeccable sense\nof timing.\cYou see, I had an errand to run for\nProfessor Rowan on my visit here.\cHe'd asked me to bring the data\nfor the National Pokédex, you see.\cSo, since you're here, let me upgrade\nyour Pokédex with the National Mode.\cAfter all, there are many kinds of\nPokémon in this world of ours!\c
[VAR 0103(0000)]'s Pokédex was upgraded\nwith the National Mode!\c
Oak: I'm afraid it won't be easy to\ncomplete the National Pokédex.\cHowever, I'm sure you will make an\nhonest attempt on our behalf!\c
Rowan: Have no fear, [VAR 0103(0000)]\nwill get the job done.\cBy the way, Professor Oak, what\ncompelled you to visit this region?\c
Oak: Ah, yes. I've heard that the\nPal Park is now open.\cIf I remember correctly, it's at the\nend of Route 221.\cThe Pal Park has a special system\nthat attracts every imaginable kind\rof Pokémon from every region.\cI've come to make certain that\nsystem is operating properly.\c
[VAR 0103(0000)], you should make an\neffort to visit the Pal Park, too.\cOops! I'll be late for my meeting if\nI don't get going!\cOK, it was a pleasure seeing the both\nof you! Bye, now!\c

Rowan: Off he goes, as busy as\never...\c
Now, [VAR 0103(0000)]...\cI have a gift here as your reward\nfor completing the Sinnoh Pokédex.\c
Rowan: That's the Pokémon Radar,\nor just Poké Radar for short.\cUse it, and it will indicate grass\npatches where Pokémon are lurking.\cI'd prepared that to help my field\nassistants put together the Sinnoh\rPokédex, but you took care of that!\cI'm sure it will be useful for your\ngoal of filling the National Pokédex.
Rowan: The world is immense.\nThere are many more Pokémon.\cThat means there are many more\nthrills for you to seek and enjoy!
[VAR 0103(0000)] checked the PC.\cThe screen is filled with special terms\nand academic writing that is impossible\rto figure out.

Catching Pokémon is best accomplished\nby whittling the target's HP down as\rlow as possible, then tossing a Ball.\cBut a Pokémon caught that way can't\nbe used in battle right away.\cThat's where the Heal Ball comes in\nhandy.\cYou can lower the target's HP bar to\nred, put it to sleep, or paralyze it.\cThe Heal Ball instantly heals whatever\nails the Pokémon it catches!\cThat's the Pokémon-friendly Heal Ball!\nPlease, do give it a try!
When attempting to catch a Pokémon,\nyou want to cut the target's HP.\cBut a fleet-footed Pokémon could\nbolt if you take too much time.\cThe Quick Ball is the solution to\nthat dilemma.\cIt's designed to work best when\nthrown right at the start of battle!\cThe Quick Ball: the perfect gift for\nthe impatient Trainer!

Oh, you were magnificent!\nAren't you quite the Trainer?\cAs the elder of Celestic Town, I give\nyou my thanks.\cOh? That Old Charm...\nMay I see that, dear?\c...\nWhat's that?\cYou say Cynthia entrusted you with\nit to deliver to me?\cThat Cynthia...\nShe's my granddaughter.\c
[VAR 0103(0000)] handed over\nthe [VAR 0108(0001)] to the elder.
This Old Charm is something made in\nCelestic Town long, long ago.\cIt was made in honor of a mythical\ndeity said to have created Sinnoh.\cThese Old Charms are still discovered\nnow and again.\cSince you're in Celestic Town, why not\nlook around inside the ruins?
You've gone to the trouble\nof visiting Celestic Town.\cWhy not take a little more time\nto examine the ruins?
There appears to have been\nan insignificant struggle here.\cEveryone should step back and view\nthings from a bigger perspective.\cYes, a bigger perspective, one that\nis on a universal scale.\c
My name is Cyrus.\cI seek the power to create a new\nworld, a world without strife.\cHowever, that power seems to be\nunavailable here...\cWe've met before, yes?\nIt was at Mt. Coronet.\cIf you discover any power derived\nfrom the legends of Sinnoh, inform me.\cFor that power is what I need to\ncreate my new world.\c
Howdy!\nStudying up on local history?
Hey, do you know what they say?\cThey say a Pokémon created the\nSinnoh region.
There's no Pokémon Mart in this\ntown...\cInstead, you can buy and sell items\nin this house here.

A giant etching of a Pokémon-like\ncreature covers the wall...\cThere is some fading text etched\nin as well...\cThe flow of time never stops...\nThe past, future, and present...

Oh, now, this is interesting.\nLet's see your Pokémon.\c
It clearly likes you very much.\nYou can have this!\c
It's about trust between the Trainer\nand the Pokémon.\cDeveloping trust in each other is\nthe key to victory.
It's warming up to you in \na very nice way.\cIt will grow even more friendly if\nyou travel with it some more.
It's not very used to you yet.\cYou both need to develop trust for\none another as Trainer and Pokémon.

Where are you from?\c...\cHm, Twinleaf Town, you say.\nIsn't that close to Lake Verity?\cThat lake is said to be home to\nMESPRIT, the being of emotion.\cIt must be looking over you.
Hm? If you get the Gym Badge from\nHearthome, you can use Surf anytime.\cUsing Surf, you'll be able to go to\nplaces that were once out of reach.\cYou may be in for some surprises\nas to where you can go using Surf.
Celestic Town is the oldest town in\nall of Sinnoh.\cThe town was founded to honor\nPokémon from the distant past.\cOr at least that's the legend...
Well, hello!\nYou look good.\cI did some research of my own since\nthat spot of trouble last time.\cMt. Coronet acting up had me very\nconcerned, too.\cWell, this is what I found in the\nshrine.\cIt's a book, and it's quite old.\nSee for yourself.\c
“PALKIA, the Pokémon that binds the\nspatial dimensions,” it is written...\c
“DIALGA, the guardian Pokémon of\ntime,” it is written...\c
It seems that there were two\nPokémon in ancient Sinnoh.\cThey respectively stood as symbols\nof time and spatial dimensions...
My big sister is studying the myths\nof Sinnoh.\cShe wants to know how people and\nPokémon interacted in the days of\rmyths.\cWere things different back then?\nOr were they the same as now?\cShe says that's the focus of her\nresearch.
It's hard to tell for sure, but it's\nprobably an invaluable scroll.
It's an old book.\n[VAR 0103(0000)] began reading it.\c“When that Pokémon was born,\nintelligence bloomed among us,\renriching our lives.\c“When that Pokémon was born,\nemotions bloomed among us,\rgiving us joy and sorrow.\c“When that Pokémon was born,\nwillpower bloomed among us,\rspurring us into action...”

Putting on a pair of glasses changes\nhow the world looks.\cTaking off a pair of glasses changes\nhow the world looks, too. Deep, man.\c

The sunlight is bright in the day.\nHow about a pair of BlackGlasses?\c
At night, reflect on what you've\nlearned with the Wise Glasses.\c
Choice Specs make the Pokémon use\nonly one kind of move.\cBut they also raise the Pokémon's\nSpecial Attack stat.
BlackGlasses raise the power of\nDark-type moves.
The Wise Glasses boost the power of\nspecial moves.

The cave painting's meaning seems\nto be this...\cThere existed a being...\cA being so powerful, it was\nconsidered a deity at the time.\cOpposing this powerful being\nwere three Pokémon.\cThe three kept balance with the\nbeing, as if they formed a triangle.\cIt's an ancient legend of Sinnoh\nthat is still told in Celestic Town.\c
Oh, yes. I found something useful.\nYou should take this.\cIt belonged to my granddaughter,\nbut she doesn't use it anymore.\c
If a Pokémon learns Surf, it can\ncarry you across water and the sea.\cBut my granddaughter said something\nabout this hidden move...\cOh, yes! To use Surf outside of\nbattle, the Hearthome Gym Badge\rmust first be obtained.\cOn that matter, you will have to\nhandle it yourself, I'm afraid.\c

You say the Magma Stone was found?\nThe legend was true, then?\cIf so, the volcano's Pokémon may\nawaken and cause an eruption!
HEATRAN...\nSo there was such a Pokémon?\cDid it come to be when Sinnoh was\ncreated?

I make it a policy to wear\nminiskirts!
Miniskirts are the ultimate!\c
What's your policy?\c
I love my miniskirt!
Caught you snoozing!\c
Miniskirts make legs look longer!\nIs that a good thing?\c
I'm on the lookout for adorable\naccessories.
Let me know if you find any nice\naccessories!\c
I wish I could dress up!\c
I want to test out something I\nlearned at private school.
Yes!\nIt worked perfectly!\c
Hmm...\nSomething's wrong here.\c
Uh... Wroar!
A battle is about momentum and\nwillpower.\c
OK, so willpower doesn't cut it on\nits own.\c
I study every day because I want to\nwork all over the world.
My dream is worldwide!\c
I need to study up on Pokémon\nbattles.\c
When I grow up, I'm going to be a\nPokémon professor!
Er-hem! Er-hem!\nYou've much to learn, youngster!\c
Er-hem! Er-hem!\nSeems I've much to learn still!\c
When the subject is Pokémon, I simply\ndon't lose!
It's a victory of knowledge!\c
I'm going to review the subject!\nAnd I'll subject you to my revenge!\c
Oh, now you look wimpy.\nI might win this.
I so did it!\c
Ouch, that hurt.\c
It's fine, fine.\nNo need to say a word.
It's fine, fine.\nYou tried your best, I know.\c
It's fine, fine...\nNo need to say a word...\c
I'm rich!
Well, of course.\nI'm rich.\c
What happened?\nI'm rich, aren't I?\c
Hmm. So, you're good, huh?
Hmm. You're no big deal.\nHmm?\c
Hmm. So, you are good.\nHmm.\c
Oh, yes.\nI shall attack now.
I've done it!\c
Oh, how disappointing.\c
Over it is, your adventure.\nCome hither and get whupped!
A done deal, it was.\c
Oh, how vexing this so is.\nVerily, I thank you.\c
How boring...
So truly boring...\c
That was a good way to waste some\ntime.\c
Hunh?\nWhere is everyone?
Hey, guys!\nWhere are you?!\c
I came to camp, but I think I got\nseparated from my friends...\c
Oh!\nYou have a Pokétch too?
I was fooling around with my\nPokétch, but I still won!\c
I was fooling around with my\nPokétch, and I lost...\c
My Pokémon trained in forests.
It's the power of the forests.\c
I'm going back to the forest.\c
I'll battle you like I'm on a picnic!
Lalala!\c
Pretending this is a picnic won't let\nme win.\c
Ooh-la-la!\nHere we come!
Ooh-la-la!\nSo happy I won!\c
Ooh-la-la!\nEven losing can't dampen my spirits!\c
I'll teach you what's fun about\nbattling.
Battling me was fun, wasn't it?\c
Oh, my, that was inspiring!\nYou're the greatest!\c
I... I can swim, really!\nI don't need my inner tube!
It... It's true!\c
I... I'm not lying!\c
I like rivers more than the sea.\nWhich do you prefer?
Water in rivers is cold, but it feels\njust super.\c
I don't like the sea because the\nsalty water burns my eyes!\c
Go, go, go!\nGo, my Pokémon!
That's the way!\nWay to go, my Pokémon!\c
Good effort!\nWay to go, my Pokémon!\c
The beach sand is so hot! It makes\nme go, “Ouch, ouch, ouch!”
I love the sea!\c
Ouch, ouch, ouch!\c
Splish, splash!
Ker-splash!\nKer-splash!\c
Flip, flop!\c
I'm a girl in love with her inner\ntube! Nice to meet you!
Thank you! I'm a girl in love with\nher inner tube!\c
Good-bye! I'm a girl in love with her\ninner tube!\c
Oh, yeah! I'm feeling it!\nI'm tuned in to your wavelength!
Tadaaaah!\c
Tch!\nLosing threw off my rhythm!\c
Rock? Jazz? Techno?\nAnything'll do for my sound track!
Squeeeeeal!\c
So, yeah... You've got me in the\nmood for singing the blues...\c
Let's get this session on!
You're obviously short on practice.\c
My dream of a world tour...\nIt seems so far away...\c
Oh, hello...\nWell, isn't that a chic scarf!
Where did you buy that scarf?\c
Oh, you! You're not just fashionable,\nyou're good with Pokémon! How unfair!\c
Thanks for supporting me!
Oh?\nYou're not my fan?\c
What a horrible way to treat\nan idol...\c
La, lala, lah.
La lalala.\nLalalah lah.\c
Bye-bye, lalah!\c
Let's see who loves Pokémon more,\nyou or me.
Fuhaha! Looks like my love for\nPokémon trumped yours!\c
Grr... Your love of Pokémon is\nstronger than mine?\c
I tell ya, my Pokémon are some kind\nof tough.
You don't want to underestimate me.\c
You're some kind of mighty.\c
OK, show me your favorite Pokémon.\nDon't be shy now, come on.
I see...\nCute, but on the weak side.\c
I see!\nCute, and yet tough.\c
My Pokémon are cute, but they're\nnot very tough!
Oh?\nWe won? Seriously?\c
It's OK. I like my Pokémon.\nThat's all that matters.\c
I've been pampering my gang too\nmuch lately. Can they do it?
Ooh, they did it!\nI knew I could count on my gang!\c
Pampering Pokémon too much is\nno good...\c
Won't you join our Pokémon Fan\nClub?
There's all sorts of fun things to\ndo if you join!\c
Join us!\nBecome a Pokéfan like me!\c
May I take your order, please?
Ah, a fine choice.\nOne loss served fresh.\c
Ah, an excellent choice.\nA win served fresh.\c
What I really hoped to become\nwas a cook.
I don't mind this job now, mind you.\c
I just find it hard talking to\nstrangers.\c
For battles and order taking, speed\nis essential!
Like, chop-chop!\nYou got served.\c
Food is like battling.\nServe it while it's hot!\c
My job is about serving others.\nBut don't expect me to serve here.
Mufufu.\c
Why couldn't you serve me?\nYou won't make friends that way!\c
Isn't this cute?\nMy uniform.
It's my favorite!\c
You messed up my uniform!\c
You're good, aren't you?
Oops.\nI'm a little disappointed.\c
I knew you were a tough Trainer.\c
I catch and raise all sorts of\nPokémon.
See?\nI've raised them pretty good.\c
I need to raise my Pokémon some\nmore!\c
I'll snag you with my net!
It's in the bag!\c
Hey!\nDon't run away!\c
Where can I find a giant HERACROSS?
I want a huge HERACROSS.\nLike, king size!\c
If only I had a giant HERACROSS...\c
Prepare to lose!
The enemy is mine!\c
I lie shattered...\c
Behold my fearsome ninja technique!
Hahah!\nYou saw it!\c
You didn't fall for my fake ninja\nboasting!\c
I shall become a real ninja when\nI grow up!
Excellent! Excellent!\c
So, what's a real ninja supposed to\ndo?\c
Should I torment you?
Yay! Yay!\c
No!\nNo tormenting me!\c
My mommy made this outfit for me.
Isn't it cute?\c
My mommy is really good at sewing.\c
Let's do our best, everyone!
Thanks, everyone!\c
Waaaaah!\c
Sure, we're going to battle, but\ndon't be over the top about it.
Hey, relax, relax.\nIt's best to be natural, dig?\c
You have to loosen up some more.\c
Fish, fish, fish, that's what I do!\nI'm gonna fish it all up!
Kahahah!\nI am at the top of my game!\c
Oh, waah!\nI let that get away!\c
Exploring relics isn't all fun and\ngames!
Your skill level says you probably\nwon't make a good Ruin Maniac.\c
Danger lurks everywhere in ruins!\c
These mates of mine traveled the\nworld with me!
What do you say?\nPretty tough, right?\c
Maybe it's time we hit the road\nagain...\c
Hey, there! Check this out!\nMy rare Pokémon!
Not just rare, either.\nMy Pokémon are tough, too!\c
Aiyah! Hey! Wait!\nNo! Stop! Don't touch!\c
Now just be patient.\nI'll show you my private collection!
See, see? Weren't they awesome?\nThey're the most super of the uber!\c
Awawawah... My...\nMy Pokémon...\c
Look! This is my favorite parasol!\nOh, and my fabulous Pokémon!
Aren't they both cute?\c
I'm only showing you!\nYou can't have any!\c
Have you ever seen a rainbow?
Have you wondered what lies beyond\na rainbow?\c
Seeing a rainbow makes me think good\nthings are in store.\c
If you were the weather, what\nwould you be now?
Right now, I'm feeling sunny\nwithout a cloud in the sky!\c
I'm feeling fogbound...\c
I really don't like weak Trainers!
You don't inspire much trust...\c
A Pokémon Trainer should be tough\nand bursting with life!\c
Lately, I've had a lot to worry\nabout...
Winning makes all my worries seem\ntrivial!\c
You just added to my worries...\c
This may hurt a little bit, but we'll\nbe done quick. Hold still!
There! Done!\c
Ooh, no!\nThat hurts!\c
Sniff... Sniffle...
Sniffle... Snuffle...\nI think I have a cold...\c
Sniff... Sniffle...\nMy nose is clogging up...\c
Sniff...
Now what could this aroma be?\c
Do you have some cologne on?\nYou smell sort of nice!\c
You're going to lose, but you'll get\nto enjoy a nice aroma!
Kyahaha! That's what you get for\nswooning to my aroma!\c
Kiiiih!\nI am so angry!\c
Let my guitar howl!\nHear me scream!
Yeahey!\c
Giyaaaah!\c
You should channel your feelings into\nsongs with sincerity, man.
The way I feel now?\nIt's rock!\c
The way I feel now is kind of folksy.\c
Now hear me!\nThe Bird Keeper's credo number one!
Soar high on a win!\c
Rest your wings on a loss!\c
Let's both do our best!
Yup, we both did the best we could!\c
Good going!\c
Fly, fly, fly!\nWe're going to rule this battle!
Zoom!\c
We're gonna crash!\c
I'm the Sailor among Sailors!\nI was born on the high seas!
The waves rocked me to sleep!\nThe sea was my mother!\c
Urp... Gweh... So, when I get up on\nland, I get no-motion sickness...\c
The sea, my beautiful sea!
Oh... I hear them...\nI hear the sound of waves...\c
I want to become a big man.\nBig like the sea big.\c
Yahoo!
Come on!\nYou holler too!\c
Gweff! Hack! Hack!\nHollering choked me up!\c
You should aspire to the Hiker's\nway of life!
You see?\nYou love my lifestyle, don't you?\c
Now, come on now!\nYou should look up to the way I live!\c
My Pokémon and I are idols!
Say what you will!\nWe're idols!\c
We have you beat when it comes down\nto popularity...\c
Watch me!\nAll eyes on me!
Ooh...\nThis is what I live for...\c
I became an idol because I wanted\neveryone to see me!\c
I'm too into battling...\nThey might fire me as an idol...
Battling is too much fun!\c
I can't help myself.\nNo one can keep me from battling.\c
I run a marathon every morning!\nIt's great!
My buff physique makes for easy\nwins!\c
So I lost!\nI can still run great marathons!\c
I'll run on the spot while battling\nfor the good of my health.
Let's hear it for good health!\c
Gasp!\nMy ankle! I rolled my ankle!\c
Out of the way!\nI've got deliveries to make!
What? You want me to deliver you\nsomewhere, too?\c
All the delivering I do every day...\nI've got deep muscle pain!\c
It was me who put up the buildings\naround these parts.
So, what do you think?\nCool stuff, huh?\c
My dream is to make a building taller\nthan a mountain!\c
Smell that? That's the smell of hay\nclinging to my body.
Whoa!\c
This smell I have is the sweet scent\nof hay that Pokémon surely love.\c
All right, take a run at me!\nMy barrel chest can take it!
What? That's all you've got?\nYou can take a harder run at me!\c
Ooh... Ow... That hurt... It's like\nyou broke my barrel chest...\c
I'm not getting any younger.\nI can't overexert myself.
What I lack in youth, I make up for\nin experience.\c
Oh, you're good and young.\nThere's a sparkle about you.\c
Hey! You there, Trainer!\nYou and me, we're battling!
Owned!\c
Unbelievable!\c
These here are my Pokémon.\nI raised them with my ma and pa.
Sure right kind of tough, aren't\nthey?\c
Well, I'll be!\nWe lost that one!\c
I'm going to do my level best.\nYou'd better keep up!
Whew! We sure did our best!\c
Yup! We tried hard, y'all!\c
OK, everyone!\nBig smiles!
Big smiles!\nCome on!\c
That's a great smile! Your victory\npose is picture perfect, too!\c
Zoom in on you!
Spot-on focus!\c
Zoom out, fade...\c
This camera is pretty hefty, actually.
My shoulder is always rock stiff...\nMy camera's toughened me up.\c
Oof...\nI'm feeling groggy...\c
Hello there, Trainer!\nPlease battle with me!
Thanks for your help!\c
I appreciate the lesson!\c
I'll do anything for a good news\nstory!
I'm relentless about battling, too!\c
Stop! Please, stop!\nYou'll break my mic!\c
So, the question is, what is your\nopinion of me?
“What a tough Trainer!” Is that\nwhat you're thinking?\c
I'm doing a live report on the topic\nof myself!\c
Come on!\nWe'll run! Together!
Gooooooooaaaaal!\c
Wait!\nDon't leave me behind!\c
Gear change!\nWe're attacking at top speed!
Vrooooom!\c
Kaboom!\c
Can you keep up with my Pokémon at\na full run?
Too slow!\c
I'm taking it to a zone beyond\nspeed!\c
I'd rather cycle casually than go\nfull speed.
Let's take it easy.\c
You ought to take things more\ncasually...\c
I only know how to go at full power,\neven against a younger opponent!
Full power is how I win!\c
Please! Let me call you Master\nTrainer from now on!\c
My spirit burns, my fists are steel,\nand my sweat cascades!
Hrrumph!\c
I sweated more. That makes\nme the victor!\c
En garde!
I'm still ready for more.\c
Urgh... I won't forget this!\c
Hey! Come on!
Nice fight!\c
You're not bad, you.\c
The ultimate of my technique!\nExperience it in its entirety!
I am the greatest!\nGwahahaha!\c
I've fallen in defeat?\nGw-gwaaah!\c
Hi! Little kid!\nA battle, please!
Little kid!\nThank you very kindly!\c
Little kid!\nI'm really upset over this!\c
I, um... I've never actually learned\nhow to do karate.
You're kidding?!\nI'm naturally talented?!\c
A Black Belt is cool, huh?\nSo I just dress up like one.\c
It's been five years since I took to\nthe mountains. My hair's grown wild!
I bathe every day!\nHow dare you?\c
Another five years...?\c
Did I catch you smirking at my\neight-pack abs?
You don't appreciate the beauty of\npure muscles!\c
Musculature is the ultimate beauty!\c
In love and in battles, I've never\ntasted defeat!
See? We won again!\c
So, I lost. I don't care!\nI have a date soon, so I don't care!\c
This is it! Over the top!\nEveryone charge!
The enemy Trainer has fallen!\nVictory is ours!\c
Retreat!\nSound the retreat!\c
My career as a Trainer dates back\n75 years. You think you can win?
Here's a toast to my history!\c
My history of glory...\c
Are you prepared?
Ah, a superb battle that was.\c
I tip my hat to you.\c
Oh, my...\nSuch an adorable Trainer...
Are we disappointed?\nHow adorable...\c
I see...\nYou're more than simply adorable.\c
Eee-yeah!
A stirring shout, wouldn't you say?\nI find it quite bracing.
Gasp... Gasp...\nOh, dear... I'm worn out.\c
Being rich doesn't shield me from\nhaving worries...
Of course, being well off is much\npreferable to poverty, but...\c
Lavish parties day after day...\nIt gets rather tiresome, I must say.\c
Come to know defeat...\nLearn what it means to battle...
I see you becoming ever more\npowerful...\c
The defeated merely slink away...\c
Look into my eyes!
You fell under my spell!\c
My power of suggestion failed to\ncharm you!\c
...
...Did it.\c
I focused my mind in silence...\c
My powers!\nThere's no trickery about them!
This is psychic power!\c
There really is no trickery...\c
Take it all!
Ahaha!\c
Gah!\c
Close your eyes and count...\nSlow... Slower...
That was the countdown to my\nvictory!\c
Tch...\nI thought I could lull you to sleep.\c
I live among Pokémon.
I've never been much of a battler,\nbut...\c
I'm just not much of a battler.\c
...They're Pokémon I've raised with\nmy father...
...Dad, are you seeing this?\nI did it...\c
Dad, I can't...\nI need to raise them some more...\c
Raising Pokémon takes a lot of\nhonest effort!
Yahaha! I've had a hands-on time\nraising those Pokémon!\c
Urgwah!\nLook what you've done to my Pokémon!\c
Will you have a look at the Pokémon\nI've raised?
Well?\nCute, aren't they?\c
Cut a girl some slack!\c
I specialize in raising cute Pokémon!
Cute, yet strong! Right?\c
Oh, but they're so cute!\c
Nice to meet you!\nUnderestimate me at your peril!
Told you!\c
I guess I underestimated you...\c
Hmhm... I must say I like the look\nin your eyes.
Your eyes remain unclouded in defeat.\nLike jewels they are!\c
Your eyes shine brighter than any\nbig gemstone I keep at home!\c
When I was your age, I was quite\nthe daredevil, I must say.
Seeing you reminds me of my own wild\nyouth.\c
I daresay, you're quite the daredevil\nyourself!\c
If you want to run home to mommy,\nhere's you chance, punk!
Geheheh!\c
Waah!\nI want my mommy!\c
Battles achieve nothing!\nTake my hand! It's about love!
I didn't mean to battle--but take my\nhand! It's about love!\c
Battling is futile!\nTake my hand! It's about love!\c
I dropped my glasses.\nI can't see straight.
I guess I won.\nI can't see enough to tell.\c
I guess I lost.\nI can't see enough to tell.\c
Steadily and surely.\nYou build from the little things up.
Steadily and surely is how I won!\c
But I did things steadily and\nsurely...\c
Hehehehe...
Gehahahaha!\c
Sob, sob, sob...\c
Everybody gather around for my\nstupendicular Pokémon show!
Wasn't that amusing?\c
Nrrgh...\nI am not amused.\c
I shall train with you.
Show some spine!\nOn your feet!\c
Fine!\nThat will do!\c
Why get all intellectual about things?\nIf it's fun, why question it?
See, I can still win.\nI don't see a problem!\c
So I lost!\nIf it's fun, it's cool!\c
I expect you to be good...\nDon't you disappoint me!
My hope was misplaced...\c
You've got good things.\c
My papa and mama are high-skill\nTrainers, too.
It's in my lineage!\c
Papa, Mama!\nI'm so sorry!\c
I go all out in battle, no matter\nwhat.
The inevitable conclusion!\c
I concede!\c
This is it! The biggest battle in my\nlife! I cannot afford to lose!
Woot, yeah!\c
This sets me back to being a Lass...\c
My love of nature and Pokémon made\na Ranger out of me!
I love to battle, too!\c
Ooh...\nI still love to battle, too.\c
Hi! Have you ever considered a\ncareer as a Ranger?
Well, you might not make it at your\nskill level.\c
Yes, you've got the mettle.\nBeing a Ranger is a lot of fun!\c
Win or lose, a battle happens only\nonce!
Do you have any regrets?\c
I have no regrets!\c
It's my sworn duty to protect nature\nand the Pokémon in it.
It's a challenging life, but there's\na lot to enjoy every day.\c
It's a rewarding career.\nHow does it sound to you?\c
My darling Pokémon will lay a licking\non you!
Well? Satisfied?\c
Well, aren't you tough?\nI'm a little stunned!\c
I didn't sleep while trying to come\nup with this new strategy!
My strategy worked!\c
Oh, but...\nI really needed to sleep tonight...\c
The credo of the Dragon Tamer!\nNumber one!
In victory, roar!\nRoar with your dragon!\c
Even in defeat, roar!\nRoar with your dragon!\c
Mighty! Like a dragon!
Strong, I am!\c
...Urf...\nI wanted to be strong...\c
See it! Feel it!\nThe ultimate power... Probably!
There is no defeat for me, the\nultimate... Probably!\c
The title of the ultimate probably!\nI confer it on you!\c
Oh, wow!\nRare Pokémon!
Hihihi... That's what you get for\nletting down your guard.\c
Tch.\nCouldn't fool you.\c
I can't stand getting cold, but I'm\nquite good.
Ch-chatter...\nWa-wahaha. I won, I won!\c
Ch-chatter... Urr...\nI'm getting sleepy...\c
My ace Pokémon are on the go!
You surprise me!\nNot too shabby!\c
I like the sense you show!\c
Snow is wonderful!\nEverything becomes white.
Snow is so romantic!\c
I'm whiting out...\c
Don't you think this coat is cute?\nIt limits my movements, though.
It's toasty warm.\c
I feel snowed under...\c
I'm the one! Number one out of all\nthe kids in shorts!
See? That's what being number one\nis about!\c
Darn...\nI'm number one...\c
I'm the one! The only one true one\namong shorts-wearing kids!
See? That's what being the only one\nis about!\c
Darn...\nI'm the only one...\c
Um...\nI'm pleased to meet you.
Awawa... We won?\nUm? S-sorry.\c
Er, um...\nTh-thank you...\c
Here goes!
Bravo!\c
Yelp!\c
You learn too!
The harsh realities of battling!\c
The joy of victory!\c
Allow me to study you.
You offered me nothing new to learn.\c
I get it now. In that situation,\nI should have used that move.\c
My teacher gave me advice on\nbattling.
My teacher was right!\nThat was just so easy!\c
Aww, my teacher was wrong!\nNone of it worked!\c
Why are we battling?\nI don't get it.
Why? I don't understand.\c
Why did you win?\nWhat happens now?\c
Ultimately, Pokémon is just another\nbrand. You know who'll win, right?
I'm not interested in what was an\ninevitable result.\c
But how... My...\nThe Pokémon I've raised...\c
There isn't anything that I can't\nbuy. Money can buy battles!
There's nothing that money can't\nbuy.\c
I'll give you my allowance if you'll\nlet me win.\c
You know, I'm really not cut out for\ndoing this socialite-lady thing...
Gahahahah!\c
You swine! Now I'm steamed!\c
I'll be done with you lickety-split!
Lickety-split is how you were done!\c
Lickety-split is how I'll excuse\nmyself!\c
Crunch-crunch...\nCrunch-crunch...
I love these crunchy Lava Cookies...\c
What am I standing on?\nBusted Poké Balls?\c
The way of the Bug Catcher!\nBear witness to it!
This is the way of the Bug Catcher!\c
All hail Bug Catchers!\c
Feast your eyes on secret techniques\nof the ancients!
See? What did you think?\nAre you awestruck?\c
That's my cue to disappear in a puff\nof smoke.\c
I see it!
Think not ill of me...\c
Gyoeeeh!\c
Pikaaa!
Pikapikaaah!\c
Pi pika...\c
A battle, you say?\nI'm never losing to you!
Yeehah! Yippee!\nI won, I won!\c
Urk...\nWe lost...\c
It's my job to be cute!
Just being cute is money in the bank!\c
Ugagaah!\nYou rotten thief!\c
You can shake hands with me!\nIt would be quite the honor for you!
If you'd won, I would have even\ngiven you my autograph!\c
My management team will have\nsomething to say about this!\c
Run!\nDon't think! Run!
Faster!\nMore! More! Faster!\c
Run!\nKeep running for me!\c
Hiya.\nNice to meet ya.
All right.\nNice seeing ya.\c
All right.\nThanks for coming by.\c
My cohorts call me the emperor of\nfishing!
I landed another big one today!\c
Why the emperor of fishing?\nIt's an ancient Chinese legend...\c
When you get as good as me, you can\nwin easily, even if asleep.
Zzz... Zzz...\c
Sssnore...\c
My mom and I travel around in search\nof lost treasures.
The rest of the time, we fish and\ntend to crops every single day.\c
You sure seem to be hectic.\c
Win! That's what I'll do again today!\nI'll win tomorrow, too!
Nahaha! Nahaha!\nI'm not gonna lose my whole life!\c
Nooooo! No way!\nI didn't lose!\c
Allow me to examine your prowess as\na collector.
You're still wanting.\nI urge you to keep at it.\c
That's quite the collection.\nI'm willing to relieve you of the lot.\c
There! There! And there!
Yes, sir!\c
Owowowoooh!\c
I want you to hear it!\nA shout from the heart!
I love music!\c
Let's hear it for an encore!\c
Battle?\nI'm up for that.
Wow.\nGood stuff.\c
Thanks much.\c
Fwoom!
Flap! Flap!\c
I'm gonna pluck you for that!\c
Sure, let's duke it out!
Let's battle again!\c
You're not half bad!\c
Looking out over the sea's breaking\nwaves... It revives memories.
Wroaaaaaar!\nDaddy!\c
Wroaaaar!\nMommy!\c
Come on! Take a run at me!\nI can take it!
So, what'd you think?\nI was too burly for you to handle?\c
Good job!\nWay to overcome my size!\c
Waah! Wait! Wait a second!\nMy mind's not into this yet!
Hunh? It's over already?\nWhat? I won, you say?\c
Huh? Hah? It's over already?\nWhat? I lost, you say?\c
My favorite drink is Moomoo Milk.\nGot some?
Wahaha! I get the win!\nLet's celebrate over some milk!\c
Gwaah! Moomoo Milk!\nBring me some Moomoo Milk!\c
You're under arrest!\nYou're under arrest!
Takedown!\c
Officer down!\c
I'm not a real Policeman.\nI'm a uniform collector.
You look like a uniform will suit you.\nYou should try to find one you like.\c
I must say, battling is a wonderful\nthing.\c
Who knows what happens tomorrow?
You can lose one day, and win the\nnext. That's how it goes.\c
I might win tomorrow.\nThat's what I believe.\c
I'm throwing my all into this match!
Yeah! Yahoo!\c
It's over!\c
The indefatigable Camper makes his\nstand!
You can become a devotee if you'd\nlike.\c
I wish I could become your devotee.\c
I don't think I have any chance of\nwinning, but sure, I'll battle.
Wow, I wasn't expecting to win.\c
I knew I'd lose.\nI'm so sorry for this.\c
I think you're awfully interested in\nme, aren't you?
You lost because you were paying too\nmuch attention to me.\c
Why did you win?\nI thought you liked me.\c
Win or lose, let's not bear any\ngrudges.
Yay, yay, yay!\nWe did it!\c
Oh, you!\nDon't ever forget this!\c
Pokémon are for adults, too...\nLet me show you...
What do you think?\nAm I deep like an old blues man?\c
Though it cuts me deep, it's a man's\nlot in life to endure the pain...\c
What I have here isn't really a\nguitar.
Beep, boop, bzzt...\c
This here is a keyboard synth.\c
For work, I sometimes get to be a\nSwimmer or a Beauty.
An idol can become anybody!\c
But the real me...\nI'm still a Lass in a miniskirt!\c
Let's enjoy ourselves.\nI hate anything to do with pain!
Ooh! That was fun!\c
Yowch! Watch it!\nYou play too rough!\c
I'll put an end to this!\nWith my favorite Pokémon!
The love I have for my Pokémon is\ncomplete and perfectly strong...\c
Why? Why?!\nWhy did I lose?!\c
Living with Pokémon...\nEvery day is the greatest.
Ehehe...\nPokémon are the best...\c
It's not a problem if I lose.\nI still have my Pokémon...\c
I have my Pokémon.\nI don't need anything else.
With my Pokémon, I can be happy\nevery day.\c
Isn't that the same for you?\nIsn't it?\c
You won't guess it now, but I was\nquite the party girl in my day.
Well, I still have it now, you know.\c
I feel nostalgic for those days...\c
Do your best!\nMy beloved children!
Wahaha! Well done!\nMama's proud of you!\c
My Pokémon are my beloved family.\c
Little boy? Little girl? Doesn't\nmatter which. Let's do this!
Little boy? Little girl?\nDoesn't matter which, but sorry.\c
Little boy? Little girl? Doesn't\nmatter which, but you're sure tough!\c
Your ride ends here.
Told ya it's over.\c
Too much for me to handle!\c
We're going for the win!\nHey-ho, let's go!
Yay! Vavavoom!\c
Aww, we lost...\nSniffle...\c
Let me introduce to you\nmy cherished partners!
How did you find them?\nMy cherished partners.\c
Awawa...\nMy partners...\c
Winning and losing isn't all there is\nto battling.
Well, sure, it makes me happy when\nI win.\c
The effort you put in is what's\nimportant.\c
It's no good to be too harsh...\nBut pampering is also out...
Being a Pokémon Breeder is a deep\nand complex challenge.\c
Balance is key for raising good\nPokémon.\c
I'll check how your Pokémon have\ngrown for you.
Not good enough!\nYour training style's not up to par.\c
This is impressive! You've raised your\nPokémon really thoroughly.\c
I'll win.\nNo lie.
See?\c
Huh!\c
Fwaah! Fwaah!\nYou think you can beat me?
Fwaah! Fwaah!\nI win!\c
Fwaah!\c
I've caught you now.\nGive up.
You weren't bad.\nLet's meet again.\c
How could this be...?\c
Yo, yo!\nLet's have a fun time!
Thank you!\nLet's play again!\c
Thanks!\nPlay with me again!\c
You're no good at all.\nI'd better teach you.
No, no, this won't do at all.\nUp on your feet. Never give up!\c
You've got good skills.\nYou tried hard, too. Excellent!\c
I'm jacking up the power to max!\nAll the way to eleven!
Ooh, yeah! I'm feeling electric!\c
Eeyow! I got zapped!\c
OK, bring it!
Hah! Too weak!\nKeep trying!\c
Hoh! You are tough!\nGive me a rematch!\c
You need to be serious with me!
Oh? That's it?\c
OK...\nQuite remarkable...\c
Ahaha! Too bad for you!\nI'm your opponent!
Ahaha!\c
Aha...\nAhaha...\c
Are you nervous?\nLeave it to the dude!
That was a good battle.\nI hope we can meet again.\c
Whew...\nThe dude wasn't expecting to lose.\c
The power of nature!\nLet me show you!
This is the power of nature!\c
Protect the natural environment...
A battle with me? I don't know what\nyou're talking about.
See?\nI thought this would happen.\c
Boo! Boo!\nThis is not right!\c
Fuhahaha!\nYour next challenge is me!
Fuhahaha! You seriously believed you\ncould defeat me?\c
Fuhahaha!\nLet us meet again!\c
Off you go! Face my team of totally\ntrained Pokémon!
Bravo!\nI knew my Pokémon would do it!\c
Oh, no! That's awful!\nWhat have you done to my Pokémon?!\c
A battle is deadly earnest!\nNot a moment of inattention!
Never let down your guard!\c
I seemed to have let my mind\nwander...\c
Hey!
Heeey!\c
Hey...\c
I'm tough, that's all.
I won, that's all.\c
I lost, that's all.\c
Shaah!
Hwooh!\c
Hawah!\c
I've been here for years, but I never\nget tired of this.
You might not think so, but I'm still\na kid. I'm in the same grade as you.\c
I'd like to keep battling Pokémon\neven when my hair is gray.\c
Let me make one thing clear...\nYou aren't capable of beating me.
Did I not say? There is no possible\nchance of you beating me.\c
How could this be...? Only that girl\nwith the inner tube has beaten me...\c
Oh, my, a mere child.
Children these days...\nSo careless.\c
Children these days...\nQuite exuberant, methinks.\c
I would like my children to become\nstrong and distinguished Trainers.
It wouldn't do if my children were\nonly as good as you...\c
It would be nice if they were as\nskilled as you...\c
Behold you shall!\nPsychic-mystifying power!
You see?\nPsychic-mystifying power!\c
No, but...\nPsychic-mystifying power...\c
My family will show you a good time!
Hold up, my family!\nThat'll be enough already!\c
My beloved family...\c
Twirl, twirl, twirl...
Are you feeling dizzy?\c
Ooorgh...\nMy head's spinning...\c
My big brother told me!\nEyes! Aim for the eyes!
Yay! I did it!\nMy big brother's plan worked!
My big brother told me to lower\nthe foe's accuracy!
Hoy! You look pretty tough.\nThis is gonna be fun!
I thought so!\nYou are tough!\c
Yup, you sure are tough.\nKeep it up!\c
Ah, welcome!\nI'm your server today!
Would you care to settle your bill?\c
Thank you so much!\c
Hello.\nWhatcha having?
Thanks a million!\c
Be seeing ya!\c
I love cute customers like you!\nI'll serve you right!
Well, were you happy with the way\nI served you?\c
Oh, but...\nI'm not done serving you.\c
Stare...
You've got something on your nose.\c
You're cool, all right.\nI had to stare.\c
I've waited a long time for a Trainer\nlike you to come along.
Yup, you're as tough as I thought.\nYou even had me in trouble!\c
I knew it!\nYou are a tough Trainer!\c
Now how should I conduct this\noffensive?
Oh, now I need a better effort out\nof you than that.\c
Oh, you're finished and content?\nOK, another time, then.\c
My Pokémon have a different taste\nfrom the usual bunch.
Did you notice the difference?\nMy party has rich depth.\c
Did you notice the difference?\nMy party is refreshingly dry.\c
Hiya!\nTough-looking Trainer, aren't you!
This feeling of elation is bubbling\nup in me!\c
Ooch...\nYou're too much to handle.\c
Varrroooom!\nWatch me go full throttle!
Vavavaroooom!\nI'm not close to redlining!\c
Vrrr... Vrruuu...\nI'm flat out of gas...\c
Jingle, jingle!
Skreeeech!\c
Thud!\c
It's my dream to cycle with my\nboyfriend.
No riding double, though!\c
I wish I had a boyfriend!\c
What's your motive?\nWhat brought you here?
You lose.\nNow what will you do?\c
Play it again.\c
We'll keep this match dry.
I admire your technique.\c
I remain humbled...\c
You're serious? A battle?\nAnd that's against me?
Cackle!\nYou shouldn't have tried!\c
Double wow!\c
I'll dance and sing and rivet your\nattention!
Ooh, baby!\c
So much for riveting your attention.\nYou nailed my Pokémon!\c
Ready, start!
First across the finish line!\c
Waah! Wait for me!\c
Can you explain why I'm here?
I mean, who are you?\c
Why am I battling here?\c
My fishing-rod-handling technique is\nthe best in all Sinnoh. Check it out!
See it?\nSurprised, I bet!\c
How I handle my fishing rod has\nnothing to do with battling...\c
The two loves of my life are fishing\nand battling.
I feel fantastic when I land a big\nfish or win a big battle.\c
I was born to fish and battle!\c
I come here on a ship.\nBig ship it was.
Sinnoh, I like.\nVery nice place.\c
You want go to sea? My ship, we will\nsee wonderful things.\c
Huh? You're my opponent?\nThis is kind of unnerving...
I'm surprised...\nI didn't think I'd win.\c
See, I told you...\nI thought you were tough.\c
Hahah! Howdy!
Hahah! Keep it coming!\c
Thanks for your time!\c
Let's be good sports about this!\nBig smile!
Ahaha! Ahaha!\nCome on, you laugh too!\c
I'm cheerful even in defeat!\nAhaha! Ahaha!\c
Buck up.
Not bad.\c
You're good.\c
The sweetest thing about battling?\nThe finishing blow!
Take that!\nThat's my finishing move!\c
Oof...\nI feel your final shots...\c
Hey, you're looking nifty!
Hey, you tried, right?\c
Hey, you're kind of tough.\c
Listen! This is my chorus group.\nMe and my Pokémon!
Shooby-dooby doowop!\c
Oh, wait!\nWe're not done singing!\c
I got tips from my online friends on\nhow to best raise my gang.
I must thank my online friends.\nI don't know who they are, though.\c
Well, this blows!\nMy online buddies let me down!\c
Can I have a moment?\nI'm trying to write some e-mail.
I need to get home quick and check\non my e-mail.\c
What do you think you're doing?\nI want to go already.\c
Father... Mother...\nPlease watch over me...
Father... Mother...\nWere you watching...?\c
Father... Mother...\nPlease forgive me...\c
Can't rightly say I much like\nbattling, I tell you.
I won, but...\nI'm still shaking...\c
Grr...\nI'm so angry I could cry...\c
It's the power of science!
Did you see? Were you amazed?\nThat's the power of science!\c
It's inconceivable... How could the\npower of science be defeated?\c
Charge, my Pokémon! Demonstrate the\nfruits of our experimentation!
Yes, my Pokémon proved my theory!\nI'll get my professorship now!\c
What kind of experiments?\nThat's classified.
I shall regress to my childhood for\nthis battle.
Googoo gagga.\c
Gagga...\c
Fwahahaha!\nYou've come a long way!
Fwahahahaha!\c
Fwahahaha!\nYou're blessed to have your friends!\c
I'll scrap you.
I'll recycle you.\c
Think ecology. Think green.\c
Why, sure! Sounds great!\nWe have to do this!
Bam! All done!\c
A battle while working...\nIt's a good way to take a break.\c
I'll try to do my best!\nPlease give me this chance!
I've done it!\nI've achieved my goal!\c
I tried the best I could!\nThank you for your encouragement!\c
A battle is... It is a love letter\nwritten in sand.
Did you understand what I'm trying\nto say? I guess you wouldn't.\c
Did you understand what I'm trying\nto say? I guess you wouldn't.\c
Hello, you there! Yes, you!\nHold up. Hold it, I say!
OK, kids shouldn't be out now.\nGo home, and be quick about it.\c
You shouldn't mess with a police\nofficer like that.\c
Sssnork... Zzz...
CLEFAIRY... Mumble...\nWait for me... Sssnork...\c
Mutter...\nEhehe... Ssssnore...\c
Let's keep this elegant!
Mmm, yes!\c
You're quite the Trainer yourself!\c
A battle isn't something you can\ncalculate.
What'd I tell you?\nYou win when you win.\c
What'd I say, huh?\nYou lose when you lose.\c
There's lots in life that doesn't\ngo the way you want.
Yippee!\nThings went my way!\c
See...?\c
There's nowhere to run or hide!
This was a foregone conclusion!\c
Farewell!\c
I wait for tough Trainers here,\ncome rain or shine.
Because of that, I've grown so very\nstrong...\c
Won't a tough... No, forget that.\nI need a cool Trainer to come...\c
This is for keeping the sun off.
I'm strong at battling, but I can't\ntake sunlight...\c
I don't want to roast my skin.\c
Well...\nThose are rare Pokémon...
I've never caught those...\nYour Pokémon are different, all right.\c
Oh, you're a Trainer?\nYou're not a Pokémon?\c
Ready?
Cool.\c
Bye.\c
Beat me?\nTry again in another ten years!
No spine!\c
You're tough!\nYou inspire me!\c
Smelling sweet scents makes me so\ndrowsy...
...Yawn...\nOh? Are we finished so soon?\c
...Yawn...\nOh, really? I lost?\c
You're sure you can handle me?\nI'm an ultrastellar talent.
Don't feel bad!\nI'm an ultrastellar talent!\c
You're in the miracle-star class!\c
I live only for battles.\nOnly victories give me hope.
...Naturally.\c
Who are you...?\c
   
    
    
   
    
    
   
    
    
   
    
    
   
    
    
Now come! Show me, the Tower Tycoon,\nwhat you're really made of!
A magnificent bout that was!\nDo come visit again!\c
Losing to an outstanding Trainer like\nyou... I can live with that.\c
Now come! Show me, the Tower Tycoon,\nwhat you're really made of!

Let's have another Pokémon battle!\nThis time, I'm gonna win!\c
I spy, with my little eye...\nA Trainer!\cA battle, please!\c
Oh, boo!\nI can't win!
My Pokémon are all tuckered out!\nI need to go to a Poké Center!
Oh, hi!\nI remember you, Trainer!\cA battle, please!\c
I'm full of energy because I get\npower from my Pokémon!\c
Oh! My poor BIDOOF and ZUBAT!
Avoid tall grass...\nOr avoid Trainers...\rDo you have trouble deciding?\n
You look familiar, Trainer.\nCan I have another match?\c
We're always together.\nI'll show you how we've bonded!\c
It's got me down...\n
I don't bear grudges over losing.\nBut I promise I'll get tougher!\n
I'm always with my Pokémon.\cActually, you're always with your\nPokémon too, aren't you?\c
Gimme a battle so I can see if I'm\nready for the Pokémon Gym challenge!\c
I guess it means I'm not ready for\nthe Gym challenge yet...\n
I guess if you don't have a single\nGym Badge, you're a total nobody...\n
I'm about to take the Pokémon Gym\nchallenge.\cBut before I go, I wanna spar with\nyou.\c
I got a nifty-keen Gym Badge from\nthe Gym Leader in Oreburgh City!\c
Oh, I lost! Lalala!\n
I'm going to collect lots of Gym\nBadges! I'll work with my Pokémon!\n
I got a nifty-keen Gym Badge from\nthe Gym Leader in Oreburgh City!\c...Did I show you already?\c
I found a Trainer while looking for\nsome Pokémon!\c
Hunh? You're finished so soon?\n
I walk through tall grass until I\nfind the Pokémon I want.\n
I found a familiar-looking Trainer!\c
Oh, a weak-looking Trainer...\nDo you want to have a go?\c
Aww...\nI should have said no.\n
I didn't know you're so tough...\nI'm going to train harder too!\n
Hi, pretty-tough Trainer!\nWill you give me a rematch?\c
My dad gave me some Pokémon!\nThey're gonna win for me!\c
But they're Pokémon I got from my\ndad...\n
Who gave you your first Pokémon?\cYour first Pokémon is the one with\nthe most fond memories, I think.\n
I'm gonna win this time with the\nPokémon I got from my dad!\c
May I please trouble you for a\nbattle?\c
Oh...\nYou're so strong...\n
Maybe I could have won if my Pokémon\nwas holding a Berry...\n
Oh, thank you for the last time.\cMay I please trouble you for\nanother battle?\c
Say, listen. What's your opinion on\nbug Pokémon?\c
I'm not going to be able to explain\nthe charms of bug Pokémon this way!\n
Bug Pokémon grow quickly, and they do\nstuff like poison and paralyze, and\rthey're cute and yet cool.\cYou gotta believe me. They're good!\n
So, listen. Tell me you've grown to\nlike bug Pokémon since we last met?\c
Let's have a battle while smelling\nthe aroma of flowers!\c
Even though I lost, I'm not angry\nbecause it smells so nice.\n
Maybe I'll put some Accessories on\nmy Pokémon at the TV station in\rJubilife City.\n
You came back to me because you\ncouldn't forget the smell of flowers!\c
Liv: We can one-shot this Trainer,\ncan't we, Liz?\c
Liv: Oh, oh, oh?\n
Liv: Awww! That is so bad!\n
Liv: You only have one Pokémon?\nThat's so boring!
Liv: Oh! You're that Trainer!\nLet's get payback, Liz!\c
Liz: We're the strongest in our\nclass!\c
Liz: Oh, but, wait!\n
Liz: I wish I could be strong like\nyou when I get bigger.\n
Liz: Um, will you battle with us?\nMe and Liv?\n
Liz: We're the best in our class.\nWe can't be losers all the time!\c
How about a quick battle before\nI leave for Eterna Forest?\c
That really dampened my spirits.\n
They say there are rough Pokémon\nin Eterna Forest.\cI'd better be more prepared than\nthis.\n
You've been to Eterna Forest\nalready, right? How was it?\c
It's a long way between Floaroma\nand Eterna City. So, let's battle!\c
Wawawaah!\nI'm out of Pokémon that can go!\n
With my Pokémon by my side, I'm\nsure any camping will be a blast!\n
While I was enjoying camping, my\nPokémon got all buffed up!\c
What kinds of Pokémon live around\nhere, I wonder?\c
I'm shocked!\nHow did I lose?\n
What can I tell you about Pokémon?\cWell, there are males and females.\nAnd some that you can't tell!
Oh, hi! We meet again!\nHave you seen any rare Pokémon?\c
Oh, I don't know.\nShould I play a little?\c
Oh, boo!\nHow insulting!\n
Listen very closely...\nCan you hear the cries of Pokémon?\n
Oh, I don't know.\nShould I play a little again?\c
There's no mountain here, but I'm\ndressed to hike! Gahaha! Here goes!\c
Oh, yeah!\nA refreshing battle that was!\n
You can find the same kinds of\nPokémon in all sorts of places.\cThere's no law saying a Hiker can't\ngo searching off in the mountains!\n
If you meet someone in the mountains,\nthey're no longer strangers.\cMeet them twice, and they're your\nfriend!\c
Of all places possible, I've lost\nmy way here...\c
Having lost his way, the Trainer lost\nthe battle too...\n
From being lost in the mountains so\nlong, I became a Hiker...\n
I've lost my way again... I'm\nbetrayed by my sense of direction.\c
Osu!\nI'm not trained to hold back!\c
I... I concede!\nYou're in a different class...\n
You taught me how I measure up!\nThank you!\n
Osu!\nThis time, I'm fully committed!\c
I love Pokémon that smell sweet.\nLike this one--get a whiff of this!\c
Did you understand what I meant?\nDidn't my Pokémon smell nice?\n
If you plant lots of Berries, you\ncan be surrounded by sweet scents.\n
Sniff... Oh?\nYour Pokémon smells nice!\c
Nothing's biting...\nI could use a break, I suppose.\c
Oh, well. I should've been a little\nmore serious about this.\n
!\cYank your fishing rod when that\nappears. That's how you fish.\n
All right! I caught some tough\nPokémon. I'm ready for battle!\c
I landed myself a feisty Trainer!\nLet's go!\c
I let a big win slip away...\n
Do you have a fishing rod?\nCatch some big ones!\n
Hey, you feisty tyke! I caught a big\none! Let's battle again!\c
I fished up some tough Pokémon!\nLet's have ourselves a battle!\c
Losing has my emotions all knotted\nup!\n
My feet are tangled, too!\nOuch! Ouch!\n
I'm going to win this time!\nI said I'll win, and I mean it!\c
Yo!\nHaving a good time cycling?\c
Hey, not bad, you!\n
Cycling Road's teeming with\nPokémon Trainers, too!\n
I'm sure I've seen your face before.\nDid we maybe battle?\c
Hey! Watch where you're going!\nOr did you want to challenge me?\c
My efforts were meaningless...\n
I might try racing through Cycling\nRoad in one long shot.\n
There you are!\cI've been riding in this spot so I'd\nget a rematch with you!\c
Your Bike is the type that can shift\ngears, huh?\cLet me see if you know how to ride\nit properly.\c
Crash! Tinkle...\n
Huh? I was supposed to be checking\nif you know how to shift gears.\rWhy am I checking out your Pokémon?\n
Let me see if you've learned how to\nride your Bike properly.\rI'll check you out again!\c
A Bicycle can only take you as far as\nyour energy will allow.\c
Gasp... Gasp... Gasp...\n
My Pokémon are out of gas.\nSo am I.\cI'm going to head home soon...\n
I got plenty of rest at home.\nI'm not losing this time!\c
I worked up a good sweat riding!\nI'm feeling great! Let's battle!\c
Whew!\nYou worked us over.\n
Do you find yourself pedaling\nbackward going downhill?\n
I worked up a good sweat riding!\nI feel ready for a rematch!\c
You and I, we're both riding\nBikes.\cAnd you've got Pokémon.\nI don't want to lose to you!\c
Oh, geez...\nI seem to have fallen off my Bike.
Instead of a battle, I should've\nchallenged you to a Bike race!\n
I hate knowing you've beaten me.\nThis time, I'm going to win!\c
I love my Bike!\cBut I'm not very good at fixing flat\ntires...\c
Kerrrash!
I admire people who understand\ngadgets.\cI'm clueless about how my Pokétch\nworks.\n
I want to practice repairing flat\ntires...\cBut I've been practicing with my\nPokémon to get our revenge!\c
Some people compete over speed, and\nsome compete over technique.\cWhich kind are you?\c
You're a speedy technician!\n
I enjoy the scenery.\cDon't you think the area below\nCycling Road looks nice?\n
I polished up both my speed and\ntechniques. Can you beat me now?\c
Whoa! You startled me!\nWell, we may as well battle!\c
Your power startles me!\n
We Hikers are bighearted guys!\nLosing doesn't bother us!\n
Whoa! You startled me!\nWe may as well have a rematch!\c
I wear shorts the whole year!\nI've got energy to burn!\c
Having lots of energy isn't good\nenough...\n
My Pokémon don't wear anything.\nI worry that they'll be cold.\n
I wear shorts! I have lots of\nenergy! I'm not losing to you!\c
Go for it, my Pokémon!\nI'll do my best, too!\c
Oh...\nWe lost...\n
Did you know? You can dig up Fossils\nin the Underground!\cThose Fossils can be turned back into\nPokémon at the mining museum!\n
Go for it, my Pokémon!\nI'll do more than my best this time!\c
Go do it, my Pokémon!\nI'll work hard, too!\c
Oh...\nWe lost...
I think we'll go visit the TV station\nin Jubilife City next.\n
Ummm... You're the Trainer who beat\nus before, aren't you?\cWe're feeling good today, so let's\nhave another battle!\c
Wahaha!\nLaughter brings good fortune!\c
Wahahaha! There's nothing that\nI can do but laugh!\n
Wahaha!\n...Go ahead and laugh at me.\n
Wahaha!\cLaughter brings good fortune!\nForgetting your gloves brings a cold!\c
I just got through Mt. Coronet, but\nwe've still got fuel in the tank!\c
Whoops!\nDidn't take much to beat us!\n
We need to rest up in Oreburgh City\nbefore heading to Mt. Coronet again.\n
I just got through Mt. Coronet,\nand who do I see?\cA Trainer who we've battled before!\c
OK, OK!\nLet's be quick about this!\c
No way! Give us another battle!\n...Oh, right. I'm out of Pokémon.\n
Yup!\nI like the way you battle.\n
What took you so long?\nWe've waited here a long time for\ra rematch with you!\c
Gahahaha! You're just a little kid!\cHow're you supposed to beat a big\nman like me?\c
I'm a grown-up, but I got served by\nsome little kid!\n
Wow, you're sure impressive!\cI guess it makes no difference if\nyou're young or old in battles.\n
Hey, you, tough little kid!\nThrow us a rematch, will you?\c
They call me The Echo Man!\nBattle with me! Yahoo!\c
Ohh... Yo...\nYodelay...\n
Let The Echo Man give you a good word\nof advice!\cIf you don't know where you should\nbe going, check the Town Map.\n
Oh, hi there! Remember us?\nI'm The Echo Man!\cLet's have another battle!\nYahoo!\c
If I beat you, will you share some\nfood with me?\c
We were starved for food, and now\nwe're starved for a win...\n
Sigh... I feel even hungrier...\nMaybe I'll chow down some Berries...\cBut that's kind of gross.\nWhat am I, a Pokémon?\n
I, uh, chowed down my packed lunch\nbefore we started climbing.\cIf I beat you this time, share some\nfood with me!\c
This karate man will pulverize you!\c
I still lack power...\n
I need to work out more.\nMy Pokémon do, too!\n
This karate man hasn't forgotten\nbeing pulverized by you!\c
Muhihi...\nI'll haul you up and out!\c
My favorite word is restraint.\nEspecially in battle.\n
You need a Good Rod if you want to\ncatch good Pokémon.\n
Muhihi... There won't be any\nrestraint this time, OK?\c
Oh, you want to have a battle?\cI was meaning to enter a Contest,\nbut beating you won't take long...\c
Oh, you have us beaten.\n
You and your Pokémon have so much\nenergy.\cI think you would do well in\nContests, too.\n
Oh, didn't we meet before?\cI was meaning to enter a Contest,\nbut let's have a quick battle first.\c
You and I!\cLet us create a scene!\nA fantastic tableau of battle!\c
Magnificent!\nI am aglow with inspiration!\n
That battle will surely become a\nstupendous masterpiece painting!\cI shall title it...\c“My Pokémon Is Fight”!\n
The key to becoming a good painter\nis to be observant.\cThat is the same for battling.\nOne must be observant!\c
Let me see how much you've raised\nyour Pokémon.\c
Good stuff! Your Pokémon are in\nimpeccable condition.\n
It's obvious you raise your Pokémon\nwith a lot of love.\n
I've raised my Pokémon since we met.\nHow much have you raised yours?\c
Listen, if you don't mind, I'd like to\nhave a battle with your Pokémon.\c
Giggle...\nThey're raised with a lot of care!\n
If you treat your Pokémon with care,\nthey'll reward you with friendship\rand loyalty.
I don't want to ever battle with\npeople who don't treat Pokémon nice!\cBut I know you treat yours kindly.\nI'll battle you anytime!\c
Hi, there! Where're you from?\nWhat kinds of Pokémon have you got?\c
Fancy folks like you have fancy\nPokémon too, it looks like.\n
I hope my pa didn't spy me slacking\noff from work here.\n
Oh, howdy! Come visiting again?\nWhat kinds of Pokémon'd you bring?\c
I jog every morning to keep my\nPokémon fit.\c
Oops!\nYou threw off my running rhythm.\n
Being healthy is number one!\nWhy don't you come running with me?\n
Do you jog every morning, too?\n
When I go on my jogs, I pass by lots\nof people.\cI have trouble remembering faces,\nbut we did meet before, right?\c
                      
                            
                           
                   
                         
                                      
               
              
                        
Hi, hi!\nI'm a Pokémon!\c
I'm so angry...\n
I want to be a Pokémon when I grow\nup!\n
Hi, hi!\nI'm a Pokémon!\c...I think you already know, but\nwe're going to battle again!\c
                       
           
                        
Ty: You're not supposed to intrude\non my time with Sue!\c
Ty: I only have eyes for Sue.\nMaybe that's why we lost?\n
Ty: Sue, even in defeat, you're\nso beautiful...!\n
Ty: I don't want to do anything\nwithout Sue...\cBring two Pokémon at least, OK?\n
Ty: Did you come back to intrude\non my time with Sue?\c
Sue: Huh?\nYou want to battle with me?\cI will if I can team with Ty!\c
Sue: I'm sorry, Ty!\n
Sue: We lost... Ty, I need a hug\nto make it all better!\n
Sue: I only want to do things\nwith Ty!\cDon't you have two Pokémon?\n
Sue: Oh, it's you again!\nI'll battle if I can team with Ty!\c
                      
                   
                                 
                                               
                                
                       
                                               
                                                      
Jogging is about rhythm.\nBattling is about rhythm, too!\c
In a sense, I suppose that was a\nfinish line of sorts.\n
When your rhythm gets thrown off,\neverything seems out of whack.\n
When I was jogging the other day,\na wild Pokémon came after me.\cI ran so fast, I was on top of the\nwaves, I swear!
Jogging is about rhythm.\nBattling is about rhythm, too.\rOur rematch is also about rhythm!\c
Emma: We battle together!\nThat's why we're tough!\c
Emma: Waaah!\n
Emma: You're awesome!\nAre you maybe a Pokémon genius?\n
Emma: We won't play with you if you\ndon't have two Pokémon!\n
Emma: When I battle with Lil,\nwe shouldn't lose!\c
Lil: We're gonna crunch and\nmunch you all up!\c
Lil: Hwaaah!\n
Lil: We're going to be tough\nTrainers, too! We decided!\n
Lil: Only one Pokémon is too lonesome!\n
Lil: You munched us all up last\ntime, but it's our turn now!\c
Hey, check this out! Look at the\nluster of my Pokémon's fur!\c
Hey, hey, did you take a good look?\n
Every day, I brush my Pokémon a\nhundred strokes. Then, I do me.\n
I brushed my party a lot.\nSo we'd be ready for a rematch!\c
I'm a rookie breeder, but I'll do\nmy very best!\c
It's all right!\nI'm still a rookie!\n
How to raise Pokémon?\nUmm... It's all about love, right?\n
I can't be a rookie forever.\nI've learned a lot since we last met.\c
                             
           
                                             
                      
                
                         
                                               
                           
                                
                               
                              
                          
                            
                           
          
                               
                           
        
                                
                                
                
                              
Teri: Yay! We're gonna battle with\nlots of Pokémon!\c
Teri: Even with both of us, we lost.\n
Teri: Our mommy is a twin, too.\n
Teri: We want to battle with lots\nof Pokémon.\n
Teri: Yay! We're gonna battle with\nlots of Pokémon again!\c
Tia: Yay! We're gonna have a battle\nwith three Trainers!\c
Tia: We two couldn't win.\n
Tia: When Mommy and Aunty and me\nand Teri get together, it's really\rconfusing and fun!\n
Tia: We want to have a battle with\nthree Trainers.
Tia: Yay! We're gonna have another\nbattle with three Trainers!\c
My Pokémon toughened up from\nworking on the ranch.\cI'm right proud of them!\c
Hahahah! Your Pokémon sure can be\ncounted on!\n
When I cuddle with my Pokémon, I can\nfeel not just their bodies' warmth, but\rtheir compassion.\n
Howdy! You're that tough little\nTrainer! I remember you!\cCheck out my farm-toughened Pokémon!\nThey're my pride and joy!\c
I'm warmed up and limber.\nI'm OK to battle!\c
Um...\nI wasn't emotionally ready.\n
Actually, I wanted to make a run\nfor it... That's a joke.\n
I'm going to keep running.\nJust as long as there's a road...\n
I've been training so I can have\na rematch with you.\cI'm OK to battle!\c
Matt: Uhohoho! I'll show y'all how\ntightly I've bonded with my daughter!\c
Matt: Parent-and-child power couldn't\nget the job done.\n
Matt: I reckon the bonds between you\nand your Pokémon are like the bonds\rparents share with their kids.\n
Matt: Oh, there's no way you could\nbeat us both with one Pokémon.\n
Matt: Ayuh? You're here to check the\nbond I have with my daughter again?\c
Ava: I can get away with slacking\noff if I have my Pokémon out!\c
Ava: Oh, sheesh!\n
Ava: Papa, I'm sorry! I promise I'll\nwork harder starting tomorrow!\n
Ava: You're battling me and my pa.\nOne Pokémon won't cut it, dear!\n
Ava: Oh, hi! It's good y'all came\ncalling on us again!\cI can take a break from work if I'm\nbattling Pokémon. Lucky for me!\c
I am one of the Ninja Trio!\nBeing discovered means I must battle!\c
I concede defeat...\n
My cover is blown, so what should\nI do?\cMaybe I'll go catch some Contests in\nHearthome City. Maybe I'll do that.\n
Do you remember me?\nI am one of the Ninja Trio!\rBeing discovered means I must battle!\c
I am one of the Ninja Trio!\nBeing discovered means I must battle!\c
I concede defeat...\n
While I hid in the tall grass, I\nsensed Pokémon all around me!\cFurtive sounds of movement...\nStifled cries... I heard them!\n
You don't remember me?\nI am one of the Ninja Trio!\rBeing discovered means I must battle!\c
I am one of the Ninja Trio!\nBeing discovered means I must battle!\cBut how did you discover me?\nDon't tell me you're a ninja, too!\c
I concede defeat...\n
A Pokémon Trainer's good at finding\nstuff, I guess.\n
You should join us so we can form\nthe Ninja Quartet!\cAnyways, let's battle!\c
You seem to have a lot of confidence.\nLet's see if it's justified!\c
Haha!\nA total loss for me!\n
You seem to have an abundance of\ntalent. It's pretty amazing.\n
When I lost to you last time, I was\njust unlucky.\c
As an Ace Trainer, I have to take\nbattles in stride.\cI need to stay cool and calm whether\nI win or lose.\c
Aiyeeeeh!\nWe lost!\n
How dare you beat us!\nGo away! Go!\n
Last time, I got a little emotional\nover losing...\cI'll stay cool and calm today!\c
Me lose to someone so young?\nI daresay not!\c
The power of youth...\nIt's startling.\n
Somehow, it makes me happy seeing\na young, yet sure-footed, Trainer\rsuch as yourself.\n
The power of youth and the technique\nof the Veteran...\cLet us battle again to see which\nshall prevail!\c
This buff physique isn't just for\nshow!\c
Ugwaaaah!\n
Why? Is it because my training isn't\nenough?!\n
My buff physique!\nFeast your eyes on it again!\c
I just startled you!\cWhile you're still struggling to\nrecover, I'll already be the winner!\c
Oh, what's that?\nYou're supposed to be fumbling more.\n
I need a better reaction out of you.\nI feel silly hiding for so long!\n
You just saw me, and I bet you\nthought, “Long time no see.”\cWhile you're still thinking that, I'll\nalready be the winner!\c
We ninjas appear where you least\nexpect us!\c
I didn't expect to lose...\n
When I hide out like this, I think\nabout what it must be like for\rPokémon inside their Poké Balls.\n
Wah! Another chance encounter with\na foe who defeated me before!\c
A ninja can use all sorts of cool\ntechniques!\c
Hmm...\nMy ninja techniques failed to work...\n
There's a ninja Gym Leader somewhere\nfar away.\cI should become a devotee of theirs.\n
What's with you?\nYou're not a ninja yet?\c
Don't be shocked when you see my\nPokémon!\c
Oh... My... Gosh...\n
A dragon Pokémon's real power is\nnothing like mine!\n
You again?\cYou must really like that dragon\nPokémon I use.\c
I'll teach you about the charms of\nbird Pokémon!\c
Wow. I'll admit to being surprised\nby that outcome.\n
The sight of you battling...\nIt was simply a wonder to watch!\n
Are you finally noticing the great\nqualities of bird Pokémon?\c
Zac: Jen, watch this! I'm going to\nuse everything you've taught me!\c
Zac: Wow. Someone that's even\nbetter than Jen...\n
Zac: I don't care if I get to meet\nthe greatest Trainer in the region...\rI'd still rather learn from Jen.\n
Zac: Wouldn't you rather battle\nwith the two of us?\n
Zac: This time, I'm not gonna let you\ndown, Jen! I promise!\c
Jen: Here comes a Trainer.\nZac, you ready? Let's do this!\c
Jen: I just got embarrassed in front\nof my little buddy here...\n
Jen: Zac, I'm so sorry.\nI'm a failure as your instructor.\n
Jen: Would you like to have a\ntwo-on-two Pokémon battle with us?\n
Jen: Here comes our Trainer!\nAre you ready this time?\c
Look at these beautiful wings!\c
Oh, you!\nI'm going to peck you for that!\n
People say there's a bird Pokémon\nthat can learn human speech.\cDo you know anything about it?\n
My bird Pokémon has such gorgeous\nwings.\cIt must have been some sort of a\nmistake that we lost last time!\c
                 
                  
              
ZUBAT! Doesn't that sound like a\nninja bursting from cover?\c
Oh!\nMy ZUBAT tristars...\n
Sowing confusion among the foe is\none way a ninja battles.\cA Pokémon can't overcome its\nconfusion unless it switches out.\n
The shinobi live by speed!\nI'll get in my attacks before you do!\c
See how Mt. Coronet towers above us.\nI want to be big like that one day!\c
A powerful presence towers before\nme... It is you!\n
Mt. Coronet has long been known as\nan ancient and mysterious mountain.\n
Hmm?! You tower before\nme again?\cIt's as if you're Mt. Coronet!\c
Hah! Hah!\nI'm psyched for this! Here goes!\c
I don't get why we can't win.\n
I guess I ought to study winning\ntechniques for a change...\n
Hah! Hah!\nThis time, I'm psyched up!\c
Speed is a ninja's best weapon!\nCan you keep up?\c
I did a lot to conceal myself, too...\n
I'll wait here for a weaker-looking\nTrainer and then ambush them!\n
I became even faster!\nHow can you hope to keep up?\c
I go everywhere with my NOCTOWL.\nWe're gonna show you owl best! Ha!\c
We did our best. That's what\nmatters. Right?\n
Even on cold days, just being with\nmy NOCTOWL keeps me warm!\n
I curled up inside my NOCTOWL's wings\nand waited for you to return!\c
Whilst exploring the ruins, I spotted\na Trainer! I must investigate!\c
My investigation has revealed the\nTrainer to be tough! Ouch...\n
Celestic Town is an old town.\nI'm sure to find something cool.\n
Whilst exploring the ruins, I spotted\nyou again! I will now investigate!\c
I'll have you know my Pokémon\nsleeps on a fancy imported bed.\c
H-humph! There's an unseemly sense\nof desperation about you. Ugh!\n
Oh, my poor little battler is\nall tuckered out...\cI'll let it sleep it off in that bed\nI had sent from overseas.\n
I do this only because I love my\nPokémon. Winning isn't that important.\c
I'd like to begin now.\nAre you quite prepared?\c
Oh, how very impressive of you.\n
Would you care to inform me of who\nthe amazing tutor you've hired for\ryour Pokémon is?\n
Oh, I'm delighted to see you again.\nAre you prepared?\c
If it pleases you, would you care for\na Pokémon battle with me?\c
Your handling of Pokémon is\nquite impeccable, I must say.\n
Bahaha! I was invited by the master\nof the Pokémon Mansion.\n
If it pleases you, would you care for\na rematch with me?\c
I've never battled a young Trainer\nlike you before. I'm quite nervous!\c
Oh, dear... That wasn't anything like\nbattling with my friends.\n
Usually, I'll have matches with\nmembers of my social club.\n
Oh, it's you again, dear?\cIt makes me a little nervous to ask,\nbut may I have a rematch?\c
                          
                 
                                                      
Hold it right there, citizen!\nWalking around at night is unsafe!\c
You've got tough partners with you.\nCarry on, citizen. Carry on.\n
Out so late? Does your mother\nknow you're out so late?\n
Well, hello there!\cThat's very civil minded of you to\nsay hello to your local Policeman!\n
Didn't I already give you a warning?\nIt's unsafe to walk around at night!\c
Are there any shady-looking\ncharacters around here?\c
Now, just hold on. I didn't say that\nyou were shady looking!\n
Don't go hanging out with any\nshady-looking characters! You hear?\n
Patrolling night and day sure is\nexhausting... Yawn...\n
Any shady-looking characters around?\nI'm always on the lookout for punks.\cExpecting some shady dude to actually\npop up... Does that make me weird?\c
Let's enjoy a fierce battle in the\nchilly night winds! Brrrr! Refreshing!\c
It was too dark for me to see very\nwell... Yeah... Too dark.\n
Oops, I'd better get back to my\nbeat before the boss radios me...\n
Yo! Hanging tough, Trainer? Word!\nI'm trying to make my lingo more hip!\n
Still training this late?\cThat makes you either a bad kid or\na good Trainer. Which one is it?\c
I'm on patrol seeing whether or not\nthere's any trouble afoot!\c
Big trouble! Officer in need\nof assistance!\n
Your toughness is too much!\nI'm in serious trouble!\n
I don't know how to say this, but\nmaybe we patrol too much.\n
Let me ask you a question!\nAre you tough enough to take me?\c
Can't you see I'm fishing?\nDon't talk! You'll spook the fish!\c
Sheesh... I let a Pokémon, and that\nbattle, get away from me.\n
Fishing and battling are delicate\nthings--as am I. Is that wrong?\n
You can see I'm fishing, can't you?\nThen don't talk to me! Geez!\c
I wish some fishing-loving lady'd come\nalong. But no, it's all just Trainers.\c
Sure, so I lost.\nBut I'll keep on fishing.\n
If you know of any ladies that like\nfishing, help me sink the hook in 'em!\n
Umm... Yeah. Weren't you that person\nwho preferred Pokémon over fishing?\c
Water Pokémon sure get happy when\nit rains. So do I!\c
Oof. Just got trampled right under\nyour feet that time!\n
Yup, a kid like you should be running\naround outside, rain or shine.\n
I've been fishing here ever since\nI lost to you.\c
Can you keep up with us?\c
You've got energy to burn!\n
However hard you battle, make sure\nyou never harm the environment.\cTry not to break any branches or\ntrample any plants, OK?
Hey! You're that high-energy Trainer!\nI bet you can't keep up with us now!\c
Are you doing your part to protect\nthe environment? I am!\c
Good. You seem to be a kindhearted\nTrainer.\n
People, Pokémon... All of us!\nWe're all a part of nature.\n
Heya, long time!\cAre you enjoying your nature-filled\nadventure with Pokémon?\c
Our job is to protect the natural\nenvironment of this region.\c
We've got to get tougher than this...
I love how natural it is here.\nI wish I could live out here.\n
What do you think? The environment\nis unharmed in this area.\c
                   
               
                                          
                               
                             
       
                                                           
                                          
I find it reassuring to be on this\ndamp soil...\c
Ufufufufu...\nYou had to beat me...\n
It feels good to mope here after a\nloss... Ufufufufu...\n
Is Damp my favorite Pokémon ability?\nFufufu... Anything will do...\c
                             
                
                                   
                            
       
                                 
                  
                        
                             
                           
I'm proud of my Pokémon!\nHere, I'll show you why!\c
Youch! You sure showed me how tough\nyou were.\n
Oh, what have we here?\nThat's a Pokédex!\cIt records Pokémon data upon\nsight? I've never seen one before!\cI heard you can move the sun or\nmoon icon to check the Pokémon\rhabitat map by time of day!\n
I take down details in my notebook\nabout Pokémon I've battled.\cI'll write more data down about your\nPokémon!\c
Oh? Here comes a nice-looking\nTrainer. This is worth evaluation.\c
Our research has arrived at this one\nconclusion: you're a tough one!\n
A huge variety of Pokémon live in the\nGreat Marsh.\cYou see, countless years ago,\nthis whole area was under the sea.\n
Oh, how do you do? May I investigate\nhow much tougher you've become since\rour last encounter?\c
There are Pokémon that become more\npowerful when it rains.\c
Like rain, my tears flow from losing...\nThey call me the Rain Woman...\n
I want to show off my pretty\nparasol, but it will get dirty\rin the rain.\cOh, such a big dilemma!\n
On rainy days, I get more energetic!\c
When it rains, I get more tense!\c
It's not very easy trying to battle\nwhile holding an umbrella.\n
If it rained every day, I could have\nmy umbrella open all the time.\n
It's not because it's raining.\nI just love umbrellas!\c
I've spotted a sneaky Trainer!\c
Defeated by sneakiness...\n
I'm sorry, it wasn't “sneaky”!\nIt should have been “tough”!\n
We're constantly on patrol.\nThat way, it's safe even at night.\n
Whoa! Hold it right there!\nI've spotted a sneaky Trainer!\c
I swim the whole year round.\nI'm not losing a battle at sea!\c
I lost in the sea...\nBut I swim the whole year round!\n
When you're out at sea, Water-type\nPokémon look more lively.\n
I love the sea. It was only by fluke\nthat I lost last time.\c
Brr... I'm starting to get chilly.\nI could use a win to get warmed up.\c
The chill of the sea, and the\ncoldness of defeat...\cIt's a double whammy.\n
Look at my lips...\nThey're the color of prunes!\n
Brr... I'm starting to feel chilly.\nHow about a hot Pokémon battle?\c
Hi, wave-riding Trainer!\nHow about a battle on the sea?\c
You sure schooled me there.\n
Maybe I should switch to surfing,\ntoo...\n
Oh, hi again!\nYou're that wave-riding Trainer!\c
Hello, there!\nAren't you going to swim?\c
What's saltier?\nMy tears or the sea...\n
There aren't many sea routes that\nyou can swim in Sinnoh.\cIt makes me want to take a vacation\nin the Hoenn region.\n
When I see people surfing, I don't\nfeel jealous or anything.\cI just simply love to swim!\c
Isn't this nice?\nI love my inner tube!\c
I couldn't move very well because\nmy inner tube got in the way!\n
My mom blew up my inner tube for me.\nI ran out of breath just opening it!\n
You can come back all you like, but\nyou can't have my inner tube!\c
Ehehe...\nI can battle, too!\c
I lost, and now I feel hungry.\n
That cloud looks like ice cream!\nI wish I could eat some! Mmm...\n
I've been dawdling here all this\ntime!\c
                
         
                               
Traveling alone, are you? That's\nimpressive! How about we battle?\c
You're good, pip-squeak!\n
Maybe I'll go work out down at the\nrestaurant again.\cThat place gets different people in\nevery day, and they all like battles.\n
Hey, lonesome traveler! Let's break\nthe monotony with another battle!\c
Awwww!\nI almost had that fish reeled in!\c
You need to have more respect for\na grown-up...\n
You need to settle down some.\n
Awwww!\nI was just reeling that fish in!\c...Oh, no. Not you again!\c
                             
                       
                                    
                       
                             
                              
                          
                                  
Let me demonstrate my technique.\nIt's how this grown-up battles.\c
That's how you attack? Pshaw!\n
You're so much more of a Trainer\nthan you look!\n
Give this grown-up another chance to\ndemonstrate her technique.\c
It seems to be very mystifying.\nThat's the sense I get.\cTo show you what I mean, I'll battle\nwith the Pokémon I found.\c
I can't win with Pokémon that I'm\nnot familiar with...\n
It seems to be very mystifying.\nThat's the sense I get.
Ah-ha! I found me a Trainer!\cI challenge you to battle with\nthe Pokémon I've found!\c
I've been traveling around the world\nchasing stories on mysteries.\cIt's made me pretty tough!\c
Sigh...\nThat's a downer.\n
There are mysteries waiting for me\nto investigate around the world.\cThis is no time to be feeling sorry\nfor myself.\n
There's an endless supply of\nmysteries around the world.\cRunning into you here just happens\nto be one such mystery!\c
                                                       
                
                           
                 
                
                            
                          
                
                        
                     
                        
                               
I'd sensed the presence of a\nTrainer for a while. It was you!\c
Defeating you will be no easy matter.\n
Is it possible to become more\npowerful by understanding Pokémon?\n
I was certain that you'd return.\nI sensed your presence, you see.\c
Look out! Behind you!\nWhat is it?\c
My plan to spook you didn't go over\nwell at all.\n
You might be tough, but let down\nyour guard at your own risk!\n
Wah! That thing curled around your\nneck!\c...Nice scarf, kid!\c
Win or lose...\nWho knows how this'll go?\cWe're playing for keeps!\c
I guess wrong far too often.\n
I can't get into the groove...\nThat's enough for today.\n
I wasn't feeling lucky the other day.\nThings will be different today.\c
For the sake of my collection, I\ntake on people I know I can't beat.\cThat's what a Collector does.\c
You should boast more about\nthat last attack.\n
I'm proud of having a Pokémon that\nothers don't have.\cOh, and I'm also proud of winning\nthe second prize on Jubilife TV's\rdaily drawings.\n
For the sake of my collection, I\nkeep battling people I can't beat.\cThat's what a Collector does.\c
Whaaat? You do!\nYou do have a Pokédex!\c
I'm so envious of your Pokédex...\n
Trainers have all sorts of Pokémon\nwith them, right?\cSo, the more Trainers you battle,\nthe more your Pokédex will fill up!\n
I don't have a Pokédex, but that's\nall right.\cYou come here and show me!\c
To find my favorite Pokémon, I'll go\neast, west, or any which way!\c
But they're my favorite Pokémon!\n
If you're trying to find the Pokémon\nyou want, you need to go everywhere!\cNot just east and west, either.\nSouth and north are important, too!
For my favorite Pokémon, I'll go\neast, west, or any which way!\c...Saying that, I've been wandering\naround here all this time.\c
Oh? You want to teach me something\nabout Pokémon?\c
Wow, is that right?\n
There are so many kinds of Pokémon.\nI can't decide which one to pamper.\n
Yoohoo, little kid! Can you teach me\nsome more about Pokémon?\c
                          
                 
                         
                        
               
                               
                         
                   
                    
                               
                       
                      
                               
                 
                     
                                                      
I was snoozing, you claim?\nI merely feigned sleep! Hiyah!\c
Gurgle...\n
I feigned a loss!\nHiyah!\n
Am I lost, you ask?\nI merely feigned it! Hiyah!\c
Check the sharpness of my fighting\nPokémon's moves.\c
You've dulled its sharpness...\n
Back to training for us!\n
I sharpened my Pokémon's moves more\nfor when I saw you again!\c
Every drop of sweat I shed makes\nme that much stronger!\c
I don't want to believe this\nhappened, but a loss is a loss.\n
Time to shed some more sweat!\n
We're going to win this time!\cDon't believe me?\nThen you test it out!\c
Hufff-huff, huff-huff.\nWant-huff a battle-huff?\c
Huff-huff, we-huff lose-huff.\n
Bye-huff now-huff.\nHuff-huff, huff-huff.\n
Running-huff is-huff good-huff.\nOver-huff doing-huff it isn't-huff!\rHuff-huff, huff-huff.\n
Huff-huff, huff-huff.\nWe-huff meet-huff again-huff?\c
I'll battle anyone.\nThat's how I'll get better!\c
You won and I lost, but the both of\nus gained something from this.\n
In a Pokémon battle, it doesn't\nmatter how old or young you are.\cYour gender doesn't matter, either.\nNothing like that means anything!\n
I'll battle against people who've\nbeaten me again and again.\cBy doing that, we both grow a little\nas Trainers.\c
I'm taking the Veilstone Gym\nchallenge. But first...\c
You made me lose my confidence...\n
I think about Pokémon all day long.\nI was confident, you know.\n
Oh, it's you again!\cI've regained my confidence.\nLet's have another battle!\c
I'm a treasure hunter.\cToday, the loot is a victory from\nyou!\c
I can't win.\nYou're too much to take!\n
If one's after treasures, maybe the\nUnderground is the better choice.\n
I'm a treasure hunter.\cThis time, I will have my trophy:\na victory from you!\c
If I battle now, won't it mess up my\nusual pace?\c
My pace is completely off...\n
Sticking to one's own goal is more\nimportant than it seems.\cIf you match your goal with someone\nelse, you'll lose your identity.\n
Well, yes, sometimes I do walk.\nI even stop on occasion.\cI am human, after all.\n
Up till now, I'd maintained my pace.\nBut seeing you threw me off!\c
                        
                              
                       
I'm an ace.\nI can see that you're an ace, too!\c
Just as I thought...
You can pretend to be ordinary, but\nyour eyes tell me another story.\n
A real ace doesn't get hung up on\ngetting wins.\cA real ace sets sights consistently\nhigher to improve themselves.\c
I always battle for keeps.\nThis is no drill!\c
Good job!\nThat was an excellent battle.\n
If you don't play for keeps, you'll\nlose battles you should be dominating.\n
When I lost to you last time, I was\nbattling for keeps.\cBut this time, I really mean it.\nThis is seriously for keeps!\c
I'm fully kitted up and equipped!\nAnytime will be fine!\c
Hunh?!\n
Perhaps I should maybe change into\na more comfy outfit...\n
I'm fully equipped again today!\nAnytime you're ready will be fine!\c
To be ready to answer any call!\nTo be ready to accept any challenge!\cThat is the way of a Trainer!\c
How disappointing...\n
You can make all the preparations in\nthe world, but if it doesn't work, it\rdoesn't work.\n
I got everything ready so we could\nhave a rematch whenever you come.\c
I'm skiing right now, but OK.\nAs we Skiers say, “Spur thing!”\c
...I've hit an ice patch!\n
I quite enjoyed that battle!\nLet us meet again. Slalom!\n
We might get snowbound, but why not?\nIt's on the “spur” of the moment!\c
Are you a novice?\nOr are you capable?\c
I never expected you to be an\nexpert...\n
You know how to play your Pokémon\nwith an edge!\n
Knowing you to be an expert,\nI challenge you to a rematch!\c
What's fun about winter?\nNumber one, skiing!\rNumber two, Pokémon!\c
Snivel...
If it was skiing, I wouldn't lose.\nI should go ski with my Pokémon...\n
You're a better Trainer than a skier.\nBut I'll challenge you again anyway!\c
How do you expect to battle in this\nheavy snow?\c
The winds of victory shifted...\n
It's so cold here, but here you are,\ndressed all lightly.\cI guess you kids are made tougher\nthan people my age.\n
Why would you wander around here?\nYou must really like this area.\c
I can withstand this cold. That means\nI can take any kind of attack!\c
Huh? It's over, you say?\n
Oh, gosh, this is bad! I think I'm\nlosing feeling all over my body!\n
Oh? I've seen your face before.\nWhat say we battle?\c
This cold is but nothing compared\nto the fire that burns in my heart!\c
Your heart burns as hot as mine!\n
The weather clears up sometimes.\nThe view is breathtaking then.\n
We'll come at you with our hearts\nablaze!\c
Wh-what is it?\nP-Pokémon battle?!\c
Whew...\nYou are alive, aren't you?\n
Around these parts, perhaps because\nof all the snow, there are many\rfolktales of hauntings...\n
This isn't like last time. See how\nmuch I've trained since then!\c
I'll show you the techniques I had\ndrummed into me at ski school!\c
I don't believe it...\nMy techniques were rebuffed...\n
I should have enrolled in a Pokémon\nTrainers' school...\n
Since I lost to you last time,\nI redid my training at ski school!\c
We Skiers feel Mother Nature through\nthe soles of our feet!\c
I got a good taste of your power!\n
Trainers get an appreciation of life\nthrough Pokémon. At least I think so.\n
I knew you were headed here.\nI felt it with the soles of my feet!\c
I've been skiing with Pokémon since\nI was just five years old.\c
Oh, um, wait... What?!\n
The scenery doesn't change very much\naround here. Don't go getting lost!\n
Oh... Did you maybe get lost again?\nYou should pay more attention!\c
Rainy days make me feel blue...\cBut the instant it starts to snow,\nI'm as happy as can be!\c
The conditions weren't very good.\n
Can any of your Pokémon use that\nhidden move to climb cliffs?\n
You really must like snow.\cAfter all, if you didn't, I doubt that\nyou'd come here so often!\c
Poof!\cYou've got a good eye spotting me!\c
You also saw through my weak\nspots...\n
I'll play with my Pokémon--even in a\nblizzard!\n
Poof!\cYou saw through my camouflage again!\c
There are several kinds of ninjas.\nAre you an Iga or a Kouga ninja?\c
I'm not much of a ninja either way...\n
I wonder why everyone stops being\na ninja when they grow up?\n
I forged my willpower in the snow!\nWitness my snowy might!\c
To make sure I'm more agile,\nI always dress light!\c
Achoo!\n
I might have to go home and dress\nwarmer than this...\n
I'm sticking it out and staying lightly\ndressed!\c
                              
       
                    
                                
         
                 
                                           
         
                          
                                    
            
                       
Yeah, yeah...\nNothing's biting!\c
...
When nothing's biting, the smart thing\nto do is just call it a day.\n
Yeah, yeah...\nNothing's biting today either.\c
                                   
     
                  
                                             
                                 
     
              
                
Outdoor fishing for the win!\cShouting doesn't help my fishing any,\nbut shout I must!\c
Gwaaah!\nThis is hurting!\n
Oh, right... My shouting is scaring\naway the Pokémon.\n
Super outdoor fishing!\nShouting still doesn't help!\c
Let it rock!\nIt's the rhythm of battle!\c
Can you hear it?\nThat's my guitar weeping...\n
I'm too torn up to sing anymore...\nI am so cool that way...\n
Rock 'n' roll!\nWe'll beat it out again!\rOur rhythm of battle!\c
A man of the sea is also a man of\nPokémon!\c
Anchors away!\n
You've got what it takes to be\na Trainer among Trainers!\n
Rudder hard to starboard!\nHold on! Nobody go overboard!\c
                 
                          
                               
                                         
              
                               
                      
       
                          
I love my inner tube.\nSo I admire jellyfish Pokémon!\c
I'm drifting away...\n
I wish Professor Rowan would\ngive me a Pokédex.\cBut that old guy looks kind of\nscary.\n
I love my inner tube.\nSo I admire jellyfish Pokémon.\cWon't you hang out with us and just\nbob around on the waves?\c
I can't swim without my floaty.\nBut my Pokémon sure can!\c
They weren't tough, my Pokémon...\n
My mommy said that Professor Rowan\nis really kindhearted.
Oh! You're the Trainer who played\nwith us before!\cCan you see if my Pokémon have grown\nstronger?\c
I only live to swim. Teach me what's\nso fun about Pokémon!\c
Wow, that was fun!\n
I'll try swimming with Pokémon next.\n
Yo! You're that Trainer who taught\nme how fun Pokémon can be.\cLet's have another battle, you and\nme!\c
On your marks, get set...\c
Owowowow!\nMy leg cramped up!\n
I forgot to do my stretching\nexercises...\n
Hi, I was waiting for you!\nReady? On your marks, get set...\c
OK! Get your breathing in order!\nOK! You're ready to go!\c
I let my momentum falter...\n
Listen, I have something important to\nsay to you.\cDon't drown in your own talent.\n
OK! You're ready to go!\nThis time, I'm going for the win!\c
Swimming is a full-body exercise.\nYou should swim, too!\c
Sunk like a stone!\n
Well, Pokémon's one thing, but you\nshould take up swimming, too!\n
Hiya, Pokémon-riding Trainer!\nYou should be swimming like me!\c
The human body floats more easily in\nthe sea, so it's easy to swim!\c
The water's too salty!\n
I've got that sinking feeling...\n
Pokémon can stay afloat even while\ncarrying someone. That's so cool!\c
I may not look it now, but I'm a\nstar. I'm always with my Pokémon.\c
I lost, but at least I had fun.\n
If it were an underwater Pokémon\nshow, I would have shined.\n
Oh, hi! Are you back to see our\nPokémon show again?\c
I bought a new bikini!\nIt's this year's newest model!\c
Psssssh!\n
I made a mistake buying this bikini...\nIt's a little too tight...\n
Did I show you already?\nMy bikini, new for this year!\c
                              
                  
                             
                               
                     
              
                
                 
Well? Does it look like I'm swimming\ngracefully?\c
I'm finally feeling fatigued...\n
I may look like I'm swimming\ngracefully, but beneath the surface\rI'm kicking furiously.\n
You were attracted by my graceful\nswimming again, weren't you?\c
Water-type Pokémon come in a great\nvariety of shapes and sizes.\cI'll show you the water Pokémon that\nI've picked for myself!\c
I can't boast when I lose...\nI'm so disappointed...\n
Sure I lost, but watch me! I'll get\ntougher with water Pokémon.\n
This time, my water Pokémon will show\nyou why I'm so proud of them!\c
Hey. I like fishing.\nBut my true love is battling!\c
Sploosh!\n
If you don't know how to fish, you're\nmissing half of life's enjoyment.\cIf you don't know Pokémon...\nYou're missing out on all of it!\n
Come on, battle me again!\nYou know I love to fish and battle!\c
                                
        
                                   
People consider me an Ace Trainer.\cLet me demonstrate the skills that\nearned me that title!\c
I'm burning with jealousy over your\nraw talent!\n
I think keeping up the effort to\nbetter yourself is a talent in itself.\n
Last time, you beat me before I had\na chance to show you my skill.\cThis time, I'll show you why they\nconsider me an ace!\c
Oh? You intend to beat me?\nI am an ace, you know.\c
I see...\nI have to concede defeat.\n
To not be depressed by a loss...\nThat's one trait of an ace.\n
Ace Trainers always work to improve\ntheir natural-born talents.\c
You're going to the Pal Park?\cIt's not right that you get to go\nbefore a Collector like me!\c
You're one enthusiastic Trainer.\n
Pal Park, huh? I wonder what kinds\nof Pokémon you can see there?\n
Listen, did you go to the Pal Park?\nWhat was it like? What was it like?\c
I'm in the middle of fishing, but OK.\nI'll be happy to sink you.\c
Whooah!
The one that got away was a big\none...\n
Once I hook it, no fish gets away\nfrom me!\cA Trainer walking by also can't get\nfree of my clutches!\c
Hi, traveler!\nHow would you like to battle?\c
You sure showed me up.\n
I like to fish.\nYou're a traveler.\cFarewell, until we meet again!\n
Hi, traveler!\cI've forgotten your name, but we've\nbattled before, haven't we?\c
I'm getting bored of fishing.\nLet's have a quick battle!\c
I've been done in...\n
Thanks, Trainer.\nThat was a good change of pace.\n
Yo! I remember how our battle was a\ngood change of pace before.\cLet's have another quick battle!\c
If I stare at the water's surface\nfor too long, I begin to forget what\rI was doing in the first place.\c
I don't know how, but I lost!\n
Oh, right...\nI was fishing, wasn't I?\n
When I looked up from staring at the\nwater's surface, I saw your face.\cI'm not sure about what I was just\ndoing, but do you want to battle?\c
                    
    
                
                
      
                 
                                                                      
                       
                                                        
                                 
     
                               
It takes both brains and brawn\nwhen you're out at sea.\cAye, it's not an easy job, the\nSailor's life!\c
Glub, glub, glub!
If you were to become a Sailor, I'm\nsure you'd make a good one!\n
I'll beat you this time and convince\nyou to become a Sailor!\c
Oh, we'll ride upon the sea,\nin a boat, just you and me!\cThat's the way of the Sailor!\nWay of the Sailor. Sing it!\c
Your Pokémon...\nThey're looking good!\n
You ought to think about becoming\na Sailor yourself.\cIt's been great to be able to visit\ndifferent places around the world.\n
Oh, we'll ride upon the sea,\nin a boat, just you and me!\cThat's the way of the Sailor!\nWay of the Sailor. You sing, too!\c
Who's there?!\nWhat do you think you're doing?!\c
I happen to be rather jumpy, so\neveryone looks suspicious to me.\n
I'm easy to scare, and yet here I am\non patrol. Funny how things go.\n
At night, I get tense and nervous.\nI don't know why.\n
I'll repeat myself! Who's there?!\nWhat do you think you're doing?!\c
I'm quite bored.\nCare to break the monotony?\c
The monotony was broken, but...\n
I'll go rest at the hotel.\nI've had quite enough of this.\n
Ah, it's you. I'm bored again.\nCare to break the monotony?\c
                                 
            
                                  
                                
                       
                               
After enjoying a meal at the hotel\nrestaurant, one has a battle.\cThat's the social etiquette.\c
Enchanting.\n
Personally, I would rather just play\nwith Pokémon than battle with them.\n
I only seem to run into you after\nI go to the restaurant.\cEtiquette calls for a battle after a\nmeal. Shall we?\c
Look, look! Look at my Pokémon!\nIt's really cool!\c
Wowee! I had to hold on tight to\nmy inner tube!\n
Pools are OK, but I like the sea\nbecause Pokémon live there.\n
Yay! You came to see my Pokémon\nagain, right? Look, look!\c
Listen, listen! Can you tell me what\nkind of Pokémon you have?\c
You're so tough. I'm stunned...\n
I want to hang on to a BUIZEL and\njust bob around.\n
Listen, listen! Did you find any new\nkinds of Pokémon?\c
                          
           
                               
                            
                
                   
                                 
                 
                 
                  
                           
I came out here because I wanted to\nsee the Pokémon League for myself.\c
I'm shocked...\nNo, really, I am.\n
The way I battle now, well, I can\nonly look at the Pokémon League!\cYou, go on! You go to the Pokémon\nLeague for me, too!\n
I've been training here in hopes of\ngoing to the Pokémon League.\c
I've decided! If I can beat you, I'm\ngoing to the Pokémon League!\c
Blblblblugh...\n
It's OK. Just let me float away\nlike driftwood...\n
I've decided! If I finally beat you,\nI'm challenging the Pokémon League!\c
It might not look like it, but I'm\ntraveling now.\c
You've got the upper hand on me.\n
But you can be sure that there will\nbe bigger challenges in front of you.\cGo! Go as far as you can! You alone can\nbroaden your horizons.\n
I'm still on my journey...\nLet's have a battle!\c
The sea around here is harsh.\nIt's made me just as harsh!\c
The world is so harsh...\n
What? You've got that many Gym\nBadges? No wonder you're so tough...\n
It's me again! The harsh sea here\nshould have toughened me up more!\c
My dream is to swim in the sea in\nevery region under the sun!\c
Boo!\nI'm not done with my dream!\n
I wonder what the seas are like in\nKanto and Hoenn...?\n
My new dream is to challenge all the\nPokémon Leagues in every region!\c
Yes, I know I can surf, but I'd\nrather swim instead.\cIt does seem weird, I agree.\c
Kaploosh!\n
If you don't know how, I'm willing to\nshow you how to swim.\n
If you rely on your Pokémon all the\ntime, you'll never learn how to swim!\c
I train at a Pokémon Gym, too.\cDon't think you're going to win\neasily!\c
Master Wake...\nI'm so sorry to have failed you...\n
What to do... Train at the Gym again,\nor train by myself...\n
I trained at the Gym after you beat\nme. Let's do it, gang!\c
I'm determined to go to the Pokémon\nLeague, no matter how hard it is.\c
Th-this is so hard...\n
Losing won't make me give up. The\nPokémon League isn't going anywhere.\n
It doesn't matter how long it takes,\nI'm going to the Pokémon League!\c
Excuse me for wearing my bikini!\c
Was I multitasking too much, battling\nand swimming at the same time?\n
When I'm in my bikini, I'm at a loss\nabout where to carry my Poké Balls!\n
Giggle...\nExcuse me for wearing my bikini!\c
Deep breathing before battle!\c
Inhale... Exhale...
Deep breathing after battle, too!\n
Don't get careless, even if you're\nfacing someone familiar.\cDo your deep-breathing exercises...\c
Your Pokémon isn't tired, even though\nit's carrying you on its back.\cLet me see how strong that Pokémon\nis, OK?\c
I've had my fill...\n
I'm tired of swimming, so I'll just\nfloat around and get some rest.\n
How much stronger have your Pokémon\nbecome?\cLet me check 'em out, OK?\c
Did you know, I was crowned the\nchampion of a swimsuit contest!\cSo now, I'm trying to win a title\nat a Pokémon Contest!\c
I've been sunk!\n
I'll need to rework my strategy!\n
I became the champion of a swimsuit\ncontest... I'm a super-talented girl!\cI'm challenging you so I can become\nthe champ of a Pokémon Contest!\c
My favorite kind of guy is someone\nthat looks good out on the open sea!\c
The tide is going out...\n
...Though there's a mysterious nature\nthat surrounds a mountain man...\n
Hello again! You're that Trainer who\nlooks keen with your Pokémon!\c
Fine, all righty then.\nJust a quick battle on my break!\c
Wahaha!\nMercy, I cry mercy!\n
I'd better get on back to work...\cYou know, I'd rather be traveling\naround with Pokémon the way you do.\n
I'm gonna let you in on a secret...\nI snuck my Pokémon to work!\c
Well, now aren't you something!\n
OK, OK, time for work! I'll work up\na thirst with my Pokémon!\n
                           
              
                 
                           
                
                           
                                 
           
                               
                                                
                          
                         
What's cool, you might ask? No?\nI'll tell you anyway: bug Pokémon!\c
It bugs me when people ignore the\nawesome coolness of bug Pokémon!\n
It would seem that coolness alone\ndoesn't add up to any wins...\n
Here comes the swarm!\c
Whoooh...\n
Did you know? “Swarm” is the name\nof a Pokémon ability.\n
My senses tingle...\nI've spotted a rare Pokémon!\c
Awawawawah...\n
I thought it was a rare Pokémon, but\nit turned out to be just a Trainer!\n
We're just out on a power walk!\c
Oh, you!\n
Eewww, nasty! There are only bug\nPokémon in the forest...\cI also forgot to buy some Antidotes.\nIt's just the worst thing ever!\n
When a Trainer and a Pokémon bond\nas one, a wondrous power is born...\c
Hmm...\n
There still remain many mysteries yet\nto be solved in this strange world...\n
A strange presence has been felt...\nIt is emanating from...you!\c
Oh! Be one with me, my MEDITITE!
The Old Chateau... I sense...\na particularly strong presence there.
I see it...\nI see it...\cI see you going down in defeat...\c
It is I that has gone down in defeat.
The Old Chateau...lies abandoned,\nwith none living in its walls...\cAnd yet, and yet, there permeates a\npresence...
This forest is strange, you know...\nIt seems to fill me with energy...\c
Your victory...\nThere is nothing strange about it.
Forests are mystifying... They seem\nto gather such unexplainable energy.
                         
               
                               
                                  
                            
                 
                             
                                  
                        
                 
                                                
                  
                 
                                           
                              
               
                                 
                             
            
                   
                                
                
                            
                                             
                
                
                                 
            
                        
                                       
               
                                 
                                                 
                  
                      
                           
        
                                   
                                               
               
                                   
                                                           
              
                                
                  
               
                            
                  
             
                          
                             
    
            
                                   
              
                                        
                         
                             
               
               
                  
You... One look at you tells me\nyou're a real contender!\c
You're as tough as you look.
One day, people will run to the other\nside of the road when I walk by 'em.\cIt's a goal of mine I'm working on.
Victory Road... Somehow, it feels as\nif my journey is now coming to an end.\cBut, before the final chapter is\nwritten, I must pen your defeat!\c
That wasn't how I planned the final\nchapter to go in my writing class...
If you don't give up, you can reach\nyour goal.\cThat perseverance is what's important\nto Trainers. That's in my book, too.
Show me how you've battled to get\nhere! Let's do this!\c
So, that's how you battled...?\n
Once you emerge from Victory Road,\nthe Pokémon League lies directly\rahead...\cBut many Trainers fail to ever find\ntheir way on Victory Road...\n
This total stranger'll be a good way\nto see if I have what it takes to own\rthe Pokémon League's Elite Four!\c
That battle just now must make you\ntougher than everyone in the world.\n
It doesn't appear as if anyone could\neven try to stand against your might.\cThe Elite Four should just surrender.
I can sense that your Pokémon have\na lot of trust in you.\cYou and your Pokémon...\nYou seem to be aglow.\c
Ah, I understand it now!\n
You blaze with so much vitality!\n
Let me take a measure of how much\nyou have raised your Pokémon!\c
Brilliant!\n
Rather than navigating Victory Road,\nI have a much better time putting\ryoung Trainers like you to the test.\n
I'm making an already-strong Pokémon\ngrow even stronger.\cI'll need your help with this!\c
There's no way I could have won!\n
Now how am I gonna teach it the most\npowerful dragon moves...? Well?\n
Top-level Trainers gather around this\nplace naturally.\cI'd go so far as to call it the ideal\nplace to train with the best!\c
That's why I like it here; I get to\nbattle tough characters like you.\n
When two roads diverge, you must\nchoose the path less traveled...\n
My Pokémon knows karate!\nI'm warning you, it's a tough one!\c
I've met my match in strength!\n
I've made it this far in life using the\nkarate I learned on the Internet!\n
I keep battling so I can soar\never higher into the skies!\c
It seems I've been grounded...\n
The wings of freedom...\cI know I'll find them if I can win\nmy way through the Pokémon League...\n
Be warned, mortal!\nI can see the future!\c
So be it! I will now divulge what\nI know of your future... Hmm!\n
In the Pokémon League ahead, the\nElite Four await you!\cBut, you knew that already.\n
I can see the past!\c
There's just so much in your past...\n
Did you...\nDid you meet a legendary Pokémon?\cNo. That can't be right...\n
Pat: It's a doubles team of aces!\nWe're gonna overwhelm you!\c
Pat: You and your Pokémon will gain\npower by helping each other out.\n
Pat: The combination of you and\nyour awesome Pokémon...\cIt's the ultimate tag team!\n
Pat: If you don't mind, we're hoping\nfor some two-on-two battle action.\n
Jo: We form a combination that's\nin perfect sync!\cHow do you expect to counter that?\c
Jo: You and your Pokémon make\na beautiful combination!\n
Jo: Yup, the way you battle is\nfantastic!\cYou should try to take the Elite Four\nright now--not later!\n
Jo: We want to have a battle\nwithout an advantage.\cPlease come back when you have\nat least two Pokémon!\n
Al: I intend to perfect my Double\nBattle technique.\cThat will make me better all around.\c
Al: You! You're an expert\ndouble battler, too!\n
Al: Your mastery over several\nPokémon at once...\cYou're a remarkable Trainer!\n
Al: You have but one Pokémon?\cI would say that you are taking\nVictory Road too lightly, kid.\n
Kay: I want to improve my doubles\ntechnique as much as I can.\cThat will improve me as a Trainer.\c
Kay: My goodness!\nYou're great at doubles, too!
Kay: Depending on the combinations,\nevery kind of Pokémon can excel.\cAt least, that's what I think.\n
Kay: You're really going through\nVictory Road with only one Pokémon?\n
We Trainers will accept challenges\nanywhere! It's what we do.\c
Hmm...\nInsufficiently raised?\n
Gee... When you're in a cave, wild\nPokémon can appear anytime!\n
To celebrate my getting through this\ncave, I'm going to battle you!\c
Well, I guess losing is something\nto commemorate, too...\n
Getting through that cave feels\nlike an adventure.\n
I'm a Veteran, yes, but don't you\ndare treat me like a senior citizen!\c
Hnuuurgh...\nSo much skill for one so young!\n
I'll always remain young at heart.\nNever let them say you're too old!\n
                                                       
          
                        
                                         
              
                                        
                         
               
               
Oh, what's this? My last one!\nThis is where we make our stand!\c
We're not done yet!\nThere's no giving up!\n
Hmm!\nMy sturdy Pokémon, defeated!\n
Aiyaah! We're coming out swinging\nwith super-heavy judo chops!\c
That was...\nA complete trashing!\n
I must rededicate myself to training.\nThe road extends into infinity...\n
Up and down you go on the lifts.\nMe? I like to battle!\c
You've got me feeling down!\n
I can't keep this up!\nI'll go back to working on the lifts.\n
A Pokémon Gym isn't only about seeing\nhow tough your Pokémon happen to be.\cIt's so much deeper than just that.\nIt's a test of you as a person.\c
That move was devastating!\n
I get to work all day with my\nPokémon, and even battle sometimes.\cI get all the fun I need every day!
An ace has the knowledge and\nexperience of battling at high levels.\cI'll demonstrate what that means to\na noob like you!\c
Wow...\nI'm in the mood to sing a lullaby...\n
Your earnest enthusiasm...\nI guess that kinda makes you an ace.\cMaybe you're a Trainer who has the\npotential to surpass aces!\n
By focusing on only one type, you can\nreally see the strengths and\rweaknesses of that Pokémon.\c
My focus was too narrow minded...
Start by becoming friendly with your\nPokémon. I mean really friendly.\cIf you do that, you'll learn naturally\nhow you should battle with it.\n
Steel represents an unbending spirit!\cIf one refuses to accept defeat,\nthe path to victory reveals itself!\c
I never gave up, but still I failed to\nwin...\n
If you give up, well, that's when\neverything ends for you!\n
Pokémon and people have worked\ntogether for many years.\cLet us show you an example of that\nhistory!\c
A spectacular loss!\nBut it's still a loss!\n
The way you helped each other...\nThat is what made you prevail!\n
What do you think you're doing to my\nPokémon?!
This can't be?! I lost?!\nYou...you uppity brat!\n
I ain't fooling around, kid.\nThis is how a professional does it!\c
You messed up my job...\nNow I'm not gonna get a bonus...\n
I hear they're going to do something\nwith electricity, I think.\n
Collecting electricity from the Valley\nWindworks... That's our mission.\c
I really don't like kids who also\nhappen to be tough Trainers...\n
You don't have an inkling of what\nTeam Galactic is trying to achieve!\cOf course, they don't tell a grunt\nlike me anything, either... But still!\n
...This is why I'm gonna be stuck as\na grunt forever...\n
...If only I had some decent\nPokémon...\n
Don't get cocky, kid!\nThis isn't over yet!\n
My Pokémon's HP is low...\nThis could be a close fight.\n
What just happened?\nI lost?!\n
Don't get cocky, kid!\nThis isn't over yet!\n
My Pokémon's HP is low...\nThis could be a close fight.\n
What just happened?\nI lost?!\n
We were having a heated discussion\nover Pokémon the way Collectors do.\c
Knowledge alone isn't everything,\nyou know...\n
I'm more knowledgeable than the\nrest when it comes to collecting.\cI have rare Pokémon!\cBut a Collector doesn't make a good\nbattler necessarily...\n
I'm a Collector, and I'm proud of\nwhat I know about Pokémon.\cWould you like me to test your\nknowledge?\c
That's some knowledge you have\nthere!\n
I don't like people who are more\nknowledgeable than me! Go away!\n
Welcome!\nThis place is my pride and joy!\c
I take losses with an unusually big\nsmile! Do you find that odd at all?\n
After a match, you should have some\nMoomoo Milk to quench your thirst!\cJust chug it right down! Glug glug!\n
                                                                   
                   
                              
                                                                
                   
                                 
                                                                  
                   
                                   
                            
                 
                   
                                 
                   
                 
It's not the end yet.
Are you saying something?\nYou think you have me cornered?\n
Amazing!\nYou're very good, aren't you?\n
Giggle! You found me!\nOf course, let's battle!\c
Aww, boo!\nLook, you've beaten me!\n
Giggle! There's only our Gym Leader\nleft. Go on, don't be afraid!\n
A forest inside a Gym...\nShocking, isn't it?\c
I was going to beat you while you\nwere still in a state of shock...\n
OK, the next Trainer is at the end,\npast two boulders.\n
My Grass-type Pokémon can dole out\nspecial attacks...\cI won't let you win easily!\c
The more beautiful a flower,\nthe faster it withers...\n
Oh, that's right...\nA hint about the next Trainer...\cIn the middle of three trees.\nThat's my hint. Good luck.\n
Even concealed, there is no hiding\nthe aroma of flowers.\c
Just like your inability to conceal\nyour abundant skill.\n
Your next opponent is under four\nflowers.\n
Hey! That there!\nThat was a good move!\n
This is where it gets exciting!\n
Hunwah!\nIt's gone and ended!\cHow will I say this... I want more!\nI wanted to battle a lot more!\n
I've landed the most fish Pokémon\nin the world. I'm next!\c
Being number one in the world doesn't\nmean a thing...\n
I figure I got too wrapped up in\nfishing and neglected training.\n
I have mastery over the incredible\npower of water. You won't win!\c
But the kid wins anyway!\nI'm just bowled over!\n
The water rising and falling is tricky,\nbut don't let it annoy you.\cIf you lose sight of yourself, that's\nwhen you're set to lose.\n
I've traveled all over the globe\nwhile raising Pokémon.\cThis is the Gym I've chosen.\nYou'll find it a handful for sure!\c
You!\nYou're a kind of top-class tough!\n
If you were to go around the world,\nI'm sure you'd meet tougher Pokémon.\n
Like the raging sea, I crash down\nand wash away everything before me!\cThat's just how I roll!\c
That wave didn't even wash\nmy hands...\n
I'm now becalmed like a waveless\nsea...\n
My body isn't the only thing I\nwork on toughening up here.\cI also work on my Pokémon and my\nspirit!\c
Wow, Trainer! You just might be\ntougher than our Gym Leader!\n
Maybe I'll do like Wake,\cI mean, Crasher Wake, and wear\nthe same kind of mask.\n
I want to become a strong Trainer\nlike Crasher Wake!\c
Groan...\nYou're too much.\n
Maybe I'll do like Wake,\cI mean, Crasher Wake, and use\nthe same kinds of Pokémon.\n
                                              
                     
                           
                                
      
                                  
                                                              
                           
                              
                                  
                      
                                 
Oh!\nBut this isn't the end, my friend!\n
I'm in a bit of a bind, aren't I?\n
I shall admit defeat...\nYou are much too strong.\n
We're the Karate Quads!\cI will strike a blow for love with my\nfist! Hiyah, looooooooove!\c
Argh! Crunched!\n
Your Pokémon sure are tough!\cBut our Gym Leader Maylene will\nbreak you like a stack of bricks!\n
We're the Karate Quads!\cI will strike a blow for courage with\nmy fist! Hiyah, couraaaaaaaaaaage!\c
I couldn't force my way to victory...\n
To overwhelm by force...\nThat is my ideal beat-down style.\cIt doesn't seem to work that way\nwith Pokémon, however.\n
We're the Karate Quads!\cI will strike a blow for hope with my\nfist! Hiyah, hoooooooooooooope!\c
We came up short, but not by much.\n
I'll have to redo my training, though.\nMaylene's gonna trample me again...\n
We're the Karate Quads!\cI will strike a blow for tears with\nmy fist! Hiyah, teeeeeeaaaaaaaaars!\c
I'm so hungry, kid...\nI don't have any strength left...\n
I lost because I didn't eat\nenough pizza.\c...No. Anything I say will sound\nlike I'm making excuses.
Oh, heavens. What is this?\nIs this my final Pokémon?\n
Never give up, never surrender!\n
You are so fantastically strong.\nI know now why I have lost.\n
I've been to all sorts of places.\nThat means I know tons of things!\c
Yeah, whatever.\nYou can battle, too...\n
I'm gonna visit new places and find\nnew Pokémon so I'll be a know-it-all!\n
Seriously, kid, why don't you answer\nthe quiz properly?\cYou could get to the Gym Leader\nwithout a problem! Waste of my time.\rNow I gotta knock you around a bit.\c
I kinda deserved that, didn't I?\nI gotta stop mouthing off like that...\n
I'll remember you and your shifty\nPokémon, too. I'm watching you...\n
Ooh, ooh! You want to battle me?\nOK then, I'll do the best I can!\c
I squeezed out all my power...\nYou're one impressive challenger.\n
Look at it this way: you can learn\nsomething from every battle.\n
Ehehe! You threw the quiz so you'd\nget to battle with me, right?\c
Don't you know how to take it easy\nor anything? Geesh!\n
Since you're here, you might as well\ntake on every Trainer.\n
I'm not afraid of picnicking anywhere,\nso I've learned all sorts of things.\c
Your toughness...\nIt's something new to me.
I've learned that Pokémon are fun\n'cause everyone plays with 'em!\n
I study subjects like Pokémon and\nhistory...\cYou know, all the important things!\c
Oh, what in the...?\nI didn't study enough?\n
You won because of Pokémon type\nmatchups, cool tactics...\cYou know, all sorts of reasons!
I've probably studied more about\nPokémon than you.\c
Oh, you!\nI feel bad that I'm so angry!\n
I'm going over the reasons why I\nlost. That way, I'll win next time.\n
Don't you have a Pokétch?\nOr did you screw up deliberately?\c
Gwaah!\nI was done in!\n
You'll have to turn back, though.\nThis is a dead end.\n
I'm going to break the ice and bring\nout my last-resort Pokémon!\n
I can sense your will to win, but I\npromise you I'm not about to lose!\n
I must say, I've warmed up to you!\nI might even admire you a little.\n
...It's t-too cold.\nI can't even feel my t-tongue.\c
This result...\n...It's cold. Bitter cold.\n
The higher up you slide from, the\nmore speed you'll have to smash\rthose big snowballs.\n
My willpower was shaped and tempered\nby howling blizzards.\cI'll bring it to bear on you!\c
You weren't even fazed...\n
I've battled countless Trainers\nand many more Pokémon still.\cMy spirit has been hardened from all\nthe battles I have fared.
Is the Gym's trick floor making you\na little hot under the collar?\cIf you can't maintain your cool in\nbattle, you'll freeze up.\c
You were surprisingly cool...\nAt least I have my warm boots.\n
Your Pokémon look so hot in battle.\nSo hot, they're cool! Hahah!
Are you feeling the chill of fatigue?\cA good Trainer goes for the win no\nmatter what their condition is!\c
That's right. A good Trainer will win,\nno matter what the situation may be.\n
The Trainer's feelings...\nThe Pokémon's feelings...\cIf they are one and the same, you\nwill never lose.\n
                                 
                     
                           
                                             
         
                                                                   
Here it comes!\nGet ready for my trump card!\n
Shocking... I didn't see this coming!\n
You've got me beat...\cYour desire and the noble way\nyour Pokémon battled for you...\cI even felt thrilled during our\nmatch.\cThat was a very good battle.\n
Wow! I'm surprised you've come this\nfar, but you'll have to turn back.\cThere isn't any chance that you\ncould ever beat me!\c
What makes your Pokémon\nso special?\n
As a challenger, you're one tough\nTrainer.\n
I'm not just looking for tough\nTrainers to battle.\cI've been battling here because\nI want to feel the rush!\c
Your power is thrilling...\nI'm thrilled down to my toes!\n
I'm so glad that there are Pokémon!\cThere isn't much else that gives me\nthe thrill that Pokémon do!\n
I want to win! I channel that desire\nthrough my guitar!\cI want to win! That desire makes\nmy Pokémon a star!\c
We couldn't win...\nNo encores for us...\n
The Trainer's desire to win!\cIf you don't lose that, there's\nno limit on what you can become!\n
Spark!\cThis is what our Gym Leader did\nto the Gym out of boredom!\c
Spark...\n
We were lacking energy...\cNo, we lacked more than that. We\ndidn't want the win enough.\n
Whether you're a Trainer or a\nGuitarist, it takes dedication to\rimprove your mad skills!\c
My skills seem to have let me down.\nI must have been out of tune!\n
The way you battle, I can feel the\nvery heart of rock and roll.\cTell me, are you maybe a fan of\nrocking out?\n
Look at the way I'm dressed.\nCan't you see that I'm hardcore?\c
I was being serious!\nDon't laugh at me! I mean it!\n
I dress this way so I can learn to\nthink like an electric Pokémon.\cWhy don't you give it a try?\n
This is the toughest Gym in Sinnoh.\cThat's why I'm here--to learn the\nbest battle techniques around!\c
...You're tough.\n
You just showed me that there's\nstill lots I need to learn.\cThe world of Pokémon is deep!\n
Can you make it to the Gym Leader?\nYou sure now?\c
The gears spin round and round...\nI spin down and out...\n
Our Gym's trick walkways are sure\nto make your head spin!\n
My dragon Pokémon chose to become\npowerful here. They sure like it!\c
Your battle style...\nSo savage...\n
It's been several years since I left\nthe Dragon's Den.\cI've got to say, your Pokémon are\nin the top class for toughness.
My dragon Pokémon chose to remain\nhere to become powerful.\c
There's something about you...\nYou're not just anybody.\cI challenge you!\c
You're at a different level of\nexpertise for sure!\n
You've won countless times...\nThat has made you very powerful.\n
There's something about you...\nYou still remain extraordinary.\cI challenge you again!\c
I constantly analyze Pokémon and\nvarious battles on my laptop.\c
...Things don't always work out\naccording to my calculations...\n
I had a lot of fun battling with\nyou, though.\cI wonder if I can analyze the\nbattle data properly?\cI could use a rematch to get\nsome additional data.\n
I analyzed our last battle on my\nlaptop.\c
For some reason I was drawn here,\nand it is here that I met you...\cI want to know what all this means!\c
I see...\cSo that's what it means...\n
I feel... I feel some sort of a mystic\npresence emanating from here...\n
Why have you come back to this spot?\nI want to know what all this means!\c
There is nothing here... And yet\nthere is a power lurking...\cWere you drawn by it, as well?\c
The power that slumbers within you...\nIt is rather marvelous indeed...\n
A place where nothing else exists...\cA place such as that is better suited\nto awaken the power within.\n
Do you see now?\nYou've come back again.\cThere must be something that draws\nyou to this place...\c
I don't care who you are--no one\ninterferes with my treasure hunting!\c
My treasure!\nMy Pokémon!\n
I heard there's an intriguing stone\nmonument around, so I came running.\n
I'm still here...and still searching\nfor treasures.\cHowever, a battle with you\nis a treasure I can't pass up!\c
A man standing alone, I face the sea\nand train.\cThese fists were hewn in that way!\c
My training and my fists weren't\nenough to defeat you!
Argh! Instead of training myself,\nI should have trained my Pokémon!\cAll I've been doing for the last year\nis staring out over the sea!\n
Ah, it's been a long time!\cI have been toughening my fists\nagainst the sea, just as before!\c
I've seen countless Trainers and\neven more Pokémon!\cSo, what kind of a Trainer are you?\c
I see...\nSimply outstanding.
I've seen countless Trainers and\neven more Pokémon.\cYou're a strong Trainer.\nMoreover, your heart is strong.\n
I am indeed a Veteran, but I don't\nuse that as an excuse to slack off.\cI take pride in challenging those\nwho have bested me before!\c
Oh snap!\nThat's how it is, then?\n
I like to study a lot...\nI thought I could win...\n
If you can beat me, I'll let you join\nmy fan club so you can adore me!\c
Ouch! Are you one of those crazy\nfans? You sure are rowdy!\n
Well, that's me and my Pokémon!\nThank you for being such a fan!\cJust so you know, our latest single\nis “Pokémon for World Peace”!\n
I've spotted a charismatic Trainer!\nWe just might have a scoop here!\c
My camera's too heavy.\nI couldn't battle effectively...\n
The lively expressions on you and\nyour Pokémon's faces...\cIt sure makes for some great TV!\n
Your spirit's vibes, man... I can feel\nthat you've got rock in your soul!\c
You beat me, man, but...\nI feel totally amped to jam harder!\n
Rock is about your spirit!\nBattling is about spirit, too!\rThat's why battles rock! Rawk!\n
You're live on camera, but try\nto act natural, OK?\c
The camera is our witness!\nIt's recorded our defeat...\n
I'd like to take that footage and\nhave it broadcast worldwide.\n
Two Pokémon! If you had two Pokémon,\nwe'd have a great scene to shoot!\n
So, let's begin and find out what\nsort of a Trainer you are!\c
You have a superstar quality!\nYou sure could become a celebrity!\n
I lost, but I'm totally thrilled!\nWe just made some great TV!\n
Oh, no. What we're looking for is you\nin action with two Pokémon!\n
Are we all ready to have some fun?\nI sure am! Aren't you having fun?!\rLet's make it fun! OK?! Mwahahah!\c
Oh, no, no, no!\nMwahahah?\n
A clown's makeup is a face that's\ncrying while laughing. Mwahahah!\cIt defines what we do!\n
Po-Po-Pokémon!\nDo you think I'm a real Pokémon?\c
Pi-pikachu!\n
I need to find a way to get more into\nthe character of a Pokémon...\n
Join me in this on-the-spot report,\nlive at the scene of a battle!\c
The media is the victim!\n
Interviews are about taking the\ninitiative. The people need to know.\n
How is this madness possible?\nThe two of us, losing to children?\n
This won't do... Time to retreat.\nThis mission is a failure.\n
How insolent.\nTake a bite of this, child!\n
Losing to some child...\nBeing careless cost me too much.\n
We are gathering Pokémon for\nan astonishing undertaking!\cYour meddling won't be tolerated!\c
I feel like I got meddled with...\n
Our astonishing undertaking is\nmost certainly breathtaking.\cIf you ever hope to see its glorious\nunveiling, then don't meddle with us!\n
                           
             
                                                       
Our objectives are incredible!\nToo incredible for me to understand!\cI'll fight blindly to defend them,\nand your intrusion won't be forgiven!\c
What was I fighting for, again?
What do you have against taking\nPokémon from others?\cLook in any field or forest!\nThose things aren't exactly rare!\n
                       
                         
                                                
Sorry, deary! Team Galactic doesn't\naccept children as members!\c
B-but, deary, you're just a kid!\n
You wanted to go up?\nWell, why didn't you?\n
Let's see how good this Pokémon is!\nI stole it from some weak Trainer.\c
What is this?!\n
Wimpy little Pokémon...\cWhen I get promoted, I'll demand\nbetter stolen Pokémon.\n
Why, thank you!\cWe love it when people come to us\nto donate their Pokémon!\c
What do you think you're doing?!\n
You can catch Pokémon anywhere.\nWhat's so special about them?\cTrainers that lose theirs should\nquit whining and catch some more!\n
                                               
             
                                                                      
This place is teeming with UNOWN...\nThere has to be some meaning to this.\cThe truth is out there...\nI'll start my search by battling you!\c
The search must continue!\n
I give up. I'm not going to rack my\nbrain over the meaning of this place.\n
I can't explain it...\nBeing here compels me to battle!\c
Hunh?!\nWhat was I just doing?!\n
Though they are gone, their desire\nto battle lives on?\cThe spirits of Pokémon still linger?\nIs that what it is?\n
I need to shake off my sorrow...\nPlease, battle with me!\c
My sorrow has deepened...\n
I won't ever forget the time I spent\nwith my Pokémon...\cNot even for a moment.\n
It makes no difference where we are.\cIf you have Pokémon with you,\nI reckon you ought to battle.\c
You've got a lot of giddyap and go\nin you!\n
Over a long life, you'll be certain\nto have some sad farewells.\cBut I reckon there are also some\nnew beginnings.\n
Hahaha! I'm afraid y'all are no match\nfor us with jus' one of them Pokémon!
My Pokémon is a lively one.\nLemme show you how much!\c
Well! Aren't you the lively one!
Them graves here in Lost Tower...\nRight'n here, inside my heart...\cThose are the places where my\nPokémon remain...\n
You haven't got yerself two\nPokémon?\n
My Pokémon were taken from me...\nTeam Galactic did it...\cEver since, I've never forgiven\ntheir faces...\c
Gwaaaaaah!\n
I'm not doing my Pokémon any favors\nby ruining its memory like this...\cI can't be wallowing around forever.\nI gotta move on and turn the page.
Mike: I can't embarrass myself again.\nNot in front of my girlfriend!\c
Mike: Awww, jeez.\nMan, that's a downer...\n
Mike: Coming here again brings back\nall kinds of memories of me and Nat.\n
Mike: You can't battle with us.\nNot with one Pokémon, anyway.\n
Nat: I don't want to look bad again.\nNot when my boyfriend is watching!\c
Nat: This makes me feel hollow\ninside... Oh, so hollow...\n
Nat: The Pokémon that brought me and\nMike together is buried here...\n
Nat: You do have at least two\nPokémon, don't you?\n
Waah! Ghost! Get away! Eek!\nHelp me, team!\c
Hey...\nYou're no ghost...\n
I had to come here because I lost\na dare with some kids at school.\cThe loser had to go to the top and\nbring back an HM...\n
Beating you would be my 100th\nstraight win! Here's to a fun battle!\c
You don't know how frustrating it is\nto lose now, after all that work!\n
I wish I could beat Maylene in\nVeilstone City one day...\n
Yeah, I like to camp! So what?\nLet's battle!\c
I should've just stuck to\ncamping out here...\n
When I'm with my Pokémon, I can camp\njust about anywhere I want!\n
If we battle here, your Pokémon will\nbecome stronger, and so will mine.\cThat's a good thing for both of us.\nWhat's not to like? Let's throw down!\c
You know, I would have really enjoyed\na win there. Would've been real nice.\n
This mine's been abandoned, but\nnow it's home to many Pokémon.\cI guess everything finds a place\nto call home someday...
Tough Pokémon...\nTough Trainers...\cYou tell me, where else can I find\na place as good as this to train?\c
That was good.\nYou've bonded well with your Pokémon.\n
Tough Pokémon...\nTough Trainers...\cA strong spirit and a tight bond...\nThere is so much to train for.\n
I'll pound the fear of my fists into\nyou all karate style, punk!\c
I'm so sorry...\nI got a bit mouthy there, didn't I?\n
So, I'm gonna try and shatter steel!\cI wonder how many more years it\nwould take for me to do that?\n
Every good Hiker gets a boost of\nenergy when surrounded by boulders!\cWrooooar! Coming at you!\nLet me blow off some steam!\c
Whew... Crazy, delicious sugar!\nI think I've calmed down now...\n
If it's called a mountain, you can\nbe sure I'll be climbing it.\cEven if it's a mountain of food, I'll\nstill be stickin' my flag on top!\n
When you're up in the mountains,\na battle'd do for a proper greeting!\c
Yahoo!\n
Actually, when you're up in the\nmountains, a simple hi'd do if\ryou walk past someone.\cOh, and this isn't the mountains.\n
May we have a battle, please?\cIt will be something to lighten up this\nboring picnic with.\c
We're not going to win if we play\naround like that...\n
I'm going home to play with my\nPokémon!\n
The working-class hero says hi!\c
The working-class hero waves bye...\n
I used to work here a long time\nago, before it shut down.\cI worked at the ironworks near\nFloaroma Town, too.\cYou might say I'm drawn by iron\nas if by magnet!\n
While I'm making sure the lifts are\nsafe, I'll focus on a battle with you!\c
A-OK! Looks safe to me!\nNot a problem in sight!\n
I routinely check the lifts here.\nYou can be sure of their safety!\n
Hey! This is no playground!\nIf you're gonna play, battle me!\c
You played me like an amateur!\n
They were going to close this place\nup so no one could get in.\cBut, they left it open so people and\nPokémon can get together here.
The Canalave Gym folks use this place\nas their training grounds.\c
Maybe I should head to the Gym and\nwork out there...\n
Roark spent his childhood playing\nhere, I think...\n
Humph! You're lost, aren't you?\nI'll guide you if you can beat me.\c
I said I'm going to win!\n
I'm not lost, I tell you!\nI'm camping! That's my story!\n
Huh? Are you lost too?\nNo? It doesn't matter.\rLet's have a quick Pokémon battle!\c
Not fair!\nWe're not on the same level!\n
I got separated from my friends...\cI've got my Pokémon with me, so I'm\nOK, but...\n
You look like you might just have\nthe Pokémon I've been looking for!\c
You didn't have a single Pokémon\nI wanted... You're no Collector!\n
I'm very picky, so I want to collect\nevery Pokémon without anyone's help.\c...I do have friends, though.\nNo, seriously! I do!\n
In deep tunnels and caves, there're\na couple things you're sure to see.\cZUBAT and Ruin Maniacs!\c
Your awesome power...\nIt's mystifying.\n
I've scoured every inch of this\nplace... Most of it while I was lost.\cAnyway, if there's one thing I can\nsay, this place can't be called ruins!\n
Hush now, lost little Pokémon, don't\nyou cry.\cI'm here to take care of you!\c
Sniffle... W-who's crying now?\n
Speaking of crying, I'm positive I\nheard crying from deeper in the cave.\n
Look! A Trainer lost in Wayward Cave!\c
I strayed from the battle plan!\n
Me? No, I'm not lost.\nI live here!\n
Wandering around, I got hungry, so\nI ate some wild mushrooms...\cThey gave me gas, and now I can't\nstop burping! Bluurrf!\c
Bleff! Hurk!\nI think...I'm getting better...\n
I hear there's a Pokémon that has\nmushrooms growing on its back.\cNot around here, somewhere far away.\nI wonder if they taste any good?
Where am I? Am I lost? Who are you?\nAre you a Pokémon Trainer?\c
OK, so we're both Trainers.\nThat's a start, right?\n
I just wanted to have a picnic under\nthe Cycling Road.\cI didn't think I would get lost\nin a place like this...
What every good picnic needs is a\ncute setting, good food, and a fun\rbattle!\c
That wasn't any fun for me!\n
Why have a picnic here? I don't know.\nThere's no deep meaning to it.
Did you come to play, too?\nWanna play battle with me?\c
You were just toying with me!
I'm playing hide-and-seek here.\nI like some underground tag, too.\n
The sharp vision of my bird Pokémon\nwill see through your weaknesses!\c
Don't you have an Achilles' heel?
I want to become stronger, but only\nwith my favorite Pokémon.\n
Learning how to manage tough Pokémon\nis the shortcut to getting tough.\c
I lost? But how is that possible?!\n
Being able to manage any kind of\nPokémon...\cI suppose that makes a good Trainer.\n
Being this tough isn't good enough.\nYou have to look cool while doing it.\cMastering that makes you an ace!\c
Made me look bad...\n
I battled the best I could.\nI wasn't uncool in losing! ...Right?\n
I want my Pokémon to get a taste of\nthe sweetness that is victory.\cI can't afford to lose this one!\c
This defeat has the tang of my bitter\ntears...
I feel sorry for my hungry Pokémon...\cSorry, guys. I'll get tougher so you\ncan feast on the taste of victory...\n
I will win. I am sure of it.\nTherefore, you will lose!\c
But...\nThis isn't possible!\n
You didn't win!\nI just lost!\cOh, whatever. It's the same thing...\n
Let me see what you got there, kid.\nI could give you some advice.\c
You got way too much!\n
Well, I don't have any advice for\nsomeone as tough as you!\n
Now we shall battle, and from it will\nemerge one loser...\c
...!\n
I can use psychic powers, but\nbattling isn't so simple...\cIt takes much more to win!\n
A battle is a clash of willpower!\cThe one who wants the win the most\nwill emerge the victor!\c
But... I thought I could win!\n
Psychic power...\cIt's hard to put faith in something\nthat you can't see...\n
Allow me to demonstrate how a true\nPsychic conducts a battle!\c
Did I get to show you anything...?\nAnything at all?\n
How do I use my psychic powers?\cI never use them for dishonest ends.\nI also never do any good deeds...
I see it!\nI see a victory for me!\c
The future...is different!\nWhy?!\n
Your efforts have altered the very\npath of the future!\n
I trained all of my gnarly Pokémon\nat the Fighting Dojo in Kanto!\c
Totally done for!\n
We're gonna go ahead and leave...\nYou know, go train elsewhere.\n
Judo chop!\nPokémon battle!\c
Wrroar!\nJudo chop defeated!
I'll forget that we lost!\c...Wait, if I did that, we'd never\nlearn from our mistakes...\n
What it means to battle...\nIts joys, its sorrows...\rI've experienced it all!\c
My sorrow deepens...\n
You may be a child, but you've taught\nme a whole lot. I thank you humbly.\n
I'll wheel out some wicked Pokémon\nand even wickeder moves!\c
All I can manage now is to wheeze\nout a few meek sighs...\n
I don't see what my age has to do\nwith playing with Pokémon, frankly.\n
I let my bird Pokémon carry me to\nwherever. And so, here I am!\c
Sheesh... I arrive in a new place, and\nit turns out to be the Battle Zone...\n
I was born in the Hoenn region.\nI've only just recently flown here.\n
I let my bird Pokémon do as they\nwish. And so, we train here daily!\c
My Pokémon grew up in the arms of\nMother Nature. They're tough!\c
How could you be tougher than\nMother Nature?\n
Most of the time, my Pokémon return\nto their Poké Balls right away.\cBut sometimes, they just fall asleep\non top of my head. That gets messy.
The desire to win... That should be\nevident in every Trainer!\c
The potential of dragon Pokémon puts\nthem at the top of my list!\c
Potential doesn't mean I can win...\n
A Dragon Tamer Champion...\cI'll need to train so much more to\neven come close to coming close...\n
I've cranked up my dragon Pokémon's\npotential!\cI've been looking forward to seeing\nyou again!\c
What my Pokémon and I most want...\nVictory!\c
Arrrgh! My GYARADOS...\n
I don't ever want to put my Pokémon\nthrough that again...\cIt got humiliated because I wasn't\ngood enough...
You've beaten us once before, but we\nwon't make the same mistake!\c
Dragon Pokémon are sacred beings...\nThat's what my master taught me.\cAnd now I'll prove it to you!\c
Not good enough!\nWe're still not strong enough!\n
It's not good enough for a Pokémon\nto just be tough.\cIt's not good enough for a Trainer\nto just work hard.\cBoth have to grow together!
This time!\cI'll show you how brilliantly I work\nwith my Pokémon partner!\c
How do you do?\nI'm a Dragon Tamer.\cWhat say we compare our Pokémon\nby means of a battle?\c
Oops!\nHow very silly of me!\n
Well, there seems to be an image\nassociated with Dragon Tamers.\cBut personally, I'm really laid back\nand easygoing, you know?\cI figure there's a whole lot of other\nthings I need to worry about first.\n
Heya, how do you do again?\cWhat say we let our Pokémon duke it\nout in another battle?\c
There is something missing in the\nway I battle...\cI've come here to find it.\c
I see it now...\nI know what I lack.\n
It's been a privilege to have battled\nwith you.\cI learned an invaluable lesson from\nyou today.\n
Have you discovered what's missing in\nyour battles? I have.\c
I've got the urge to battle with you.\nHope you're willing to oblige!\c
I shouldn't have paid attention\nto my urge...\n
So long as my partner's alongside me,\nI'm willing to take on the world!\n
The urge to battle you again has\nstruck me. Want to humor me?\c
Have you any knowledge of levels\nor the stats of Pokémon? Well, I do!\c
Hmm. I like how you attack.\n
Pokémon and numbers...\nWho cares about that stuff?\cWinning is what's important.\nNumbers aren't everything.\n
Pokémon battles aren't decided by\nnumbers.\cIt's the bond you share with your\nPokémon that decides outcomes!\c
Welcome to my Pokémon show!\c
Did you enjoy the show?\nSuper fabulous, wasn't it?\n
I'll be happy to battle you again!\nLet's battle again sometime, yeah?
Welcome to my new Pokémon show!\c
My team's been trained through\nand through!\cYou'll shake when you see how\ntough they are!\c
I'm sh-sh-shaking all over...\n
I fed my gang Protein, Carbos...\nYou name it, I pumped 'em full of it.\n
Hey! You're that Trainer who left\nme all shook up! Uh-huh!\cThis time, it's my turn to leave you\nshaking all over!\c
I've leveled my precious partner this\nfar. I'll let you see it!\c
It needs to be leveled more?!\n
My Pokémon...\cIt's actually the very first friend\nthat I've ever had.\n
...When I close my eyes, I'm taken\nback to that time we lost to you.\cMy partner's leveled since then.\nI'll prove it to you!\c
Worthy opponents... The search for\nthem drives me to travel far.\c
I've certainly found a tough\nadversary in you...\n
How much you believe in your\nPokémon...\cThat's a critical factor in how a\nbattle will turn out.\n
We've faced many challengers since\nwe met, but they were all weak...\cI relish the tough resistance that\nonly you can provide!\c
Please don't hold anything back.\c
Hmm...\n
I feel invigorated from that battle,\neven though we lost.\cAfter all, we gave it everything we\nhad.
Hello again! Please don't hold\nanything back--just like before.\c
You're willing to battle?\nLet me see what you have?\c
Your love of Pokémon really shows!\n
I grew up together with my team,\nright from my childhood.\cAll our memories, we've always shared\nthem.\n
Oh, hi, we meet again.\cMay I see what you've done with your\nPokémon?\c
The world is huge, and there are\nso many different Pokémon!\cWhat kinds of Pokémon are with you?\nPlease, I want to have a look!\c
Wow, there are Pokémon that\nwonderful!\n
There is always something to like\nabout any Pokémon.\cIt's so hard to decide which ones\nI should raise.\n
If I'm having trouble deciding,\nI go with my favorites!\c
What sort of moves have you taught?\nThat tells me how good you are!\c
Yowch!\n
I heard that somewhere there's\nsomeone who teaches Pokémon moves.\n
Have you taught your team any new\nmoves since last time?\c
When eyes meet...\nThat's when a battle starts!\c
You won't let me win?\n
I suddenly remembered what it was \nlike when I had my first battle.\cI wonder why that would be?\n
When eyes meet...\nThat's when a battle starts!\rThat's what makes us Trainers!\c
You're going to win!\nThat's the future I saw!\c
What I saw in the future turned out\nto be true...\n
I lost, but my vision of the future\ncame true...\n
You're going to win again!\nThat's the future I saw!\c
Right after this, you will send out\nPokémon to battle me!\c
Right after this, I have to pay\nout your prize money...\n
What will happen to you after this?\nWhy don't you do just as you like?\rIt would be more fun that way.\n
Right after this, you will hurl a Poké\nBall in an astonishingly cool way!\c
My quest for power brought me here.\cIt was beneath the desert sand that\nI toughened my body and soul.\cAccept my challenge! Uraah!\c
My spirit is broken...\n
I thought I couldn't win before it\nbecame a fact...\cI've let down my Pokémon...\cThey go to battle with faith in\ntheir Trainer...
This time! This time I will win!\nMy spirit is renewed and strong!\c
I have meditated under a waterfall\nto temper my spirit.\cAllow me to demonstrate its strength!\c
Ha-choo! Sniffle...\n
All that time under the waterfall...\nSeems I've caught a cold.\n
Since the day I lost to you, I've\nmeditated under a waterfall!\c
People! Nature! Pokémon!\nHarmony is essential!\c
You're A-OK!\n
Protecting Pokémon and nature.\nThink of what that means.\n
Do you remember my slogan?\nPeople! Nature! Pokémon!\cThat's right, harmony is essential!\c
I work to protect beautiful, natural\nenvironments.\cMy Pokémon are my constant\ncompanions while I work.\c
Oh, my gosh!\nMy poor Pokémon!\n
Everyone can do their part to keep\nnature clean. It doesn't take much.\n
I'm on patrol in pristine nature\nwith my Pokémon like usual.\cCome to think of it, you're always\nwith Pokémon, too.\c
We go on patrol to make sure there's\nnothing strange going on.\cAnd occasionally, we battle!\c
Thanks much!\n
You know that Pokémon ability Pickup?\cI think that's a good way of keeping\nthe environment clean of litter.
Patrols day in and day out!\nAnd the occasional battle!\c
In the embrace of Mother Nature,\npeople and Pokémon grow strong!\c
My, you are tough.\n
You can grow strong anywhere.\nIt doesn't matter where you are.\n
By battling tough opponents, both\nTrainers and Pokémon grow tough!\c
We've grown strong together in\nnature and in the concrete jungle.\cWe make everywhere we go our\nplayground!\c
You're fantastically tough,\naren't you?!\n
Look around you at this wildly\ncontorted terrain.\cIt's no wonder that Pokémon would\ngrow tough in a place like this.\n
I think I'm pretty tough, but so\nare you and your Pokémon.\cLet's have a battle to see who\nis the toughest!\c
Are you getting worn out from all\nthe running you've done?\c
You're not tired at all?!\n
The world is full of Pokémon and all\nsorts of Trainers.\n
What do you think of the Battle\nZone?\cYou've met so many Pokémon...\nI've got to battle you again!\c
A Trainer riding a Pokémon!\nI like that! We've gotta battle!\c
Awesome!\nYou're a real wild child!\n
Riding the waves on a Pokémon's\nback...\cYeah, that's something to talk\nabout, all right.\n
Yo, Pokémon-riding Trainer!\nHow about a rematch?\c
Check out my physique! The rough\nseas sculpted this awesome body!\c
Muscles I have plenty of...\nBut let's not talk about power.\n
You've got your Pokémon using\na hidden move for you...\cI find that really moving.
The rough seas here almost\ndrowned...\cWait, no, shaped my physique!\nSee how buff it is!\c
Check out my dynamic form!\nVictory is assured!\c
Oh.\nThat's how it is.\n
Being a good swimmer doesn't make\nme any better as a Trainer...\n
Hi! You're that kid who's great with\nPokémon!\cI'll battle with an even more dynamic\nform than before! Watch me now!\c
Me and my Pokémon are pumped up\nand ready to go all out!\c
Our muscles are deflating...\n
Overwhelm with our dazzling physiques!\nThat was our game plan...\n
Me and my Pokémon are pumped up!\nSee, our muscles are twitching!\c
People keep coming to us for battles.\nI really don't know why! Teehee!\c
OK, we lost.\n
I wanted to be alone, but swatting\naway immature boys on the prowl...\cWell, my Pokémon grew tough without\nme really even trying.\n
People still keep coming to us for\nbattles! Why?! Leave me alone!\c
Are your Pokémon growing up?\c
Maybe too grown up!\n
I've grown with my Pokémon, too.\nMy swimsuit's getting a little tight...\n
Did your Pokémon grow any more?\cMy Pokémon?\nMine are doing awesome!\c
I'm a mermaid who drifts among\nthe waves...\cBut I'm also a playful girl who likes\nto have fun with Pokémon!\c
Losing brings tears to my eyes...\n
A mermaid's tears are so salty...\n
I remain a mermaid who drifts among\nthe waves...\cBut I'm also a playful girl who likes\nto have fun with Pokémon!\c
I want to be with my water Pokémon.\nThat's why I swim.\c
Glub glub...\nI'm sinking...\n
Everyone I know says they have to\ntrain harder and more often.\cI thought so too, but I find it hard\nto get that serious about it.\cBeing with my Pokémon puts me in\na mellow mood, I guess.\n
I want to be with my water Pokémon.\nThat's why I want to be stronger!\c
                                                                 
                    
                                                         
With one mighty flap, my birds blow\naway the embers of aggression!\c
We failed to get off the ground...\n
The HM Fly isn't useful inside caves.\nIt's such a shame.\n
Dragons and a fiery mountain...\nIt's a totally classic setup!\c
Losing isn't a happy occasion...\n
My Pokémon seem to like it here\na lot.\n
Are you seeking the mythical\nPokémon, too? Let's battle, then!\c
There's nothing left...\n
The mythical Pokémon that sleeps\ndeep in a volcano...\cCould it be a dragon Pokémon?\n
What it means to win battles...\nThat is what I seek.\rTeach me if you will!\c
I grow less certain still...\n
Perhaps there is no meaning to\nvictory, but still I will battle!\cThat is what makes me a Trainer!\n
Being with Pokémon makes me happy.\cAnd when we win, I feel happier\nstill!\c
We're still happy even when we lose!\n
Raising Pokémon to the extremes...\nHaving fun with Pokémon...\cPeople should do whatever makes them\nhappy. That's what I think!\n
I was born in Floaroma Town.\nI'm sure thrilled to be here.\cIt took a long time to get here.\nWe're not going to lose again!\c
We went down...\nWe couldn't stick it out...\n
You can level all you want, but that\nwon't guarantee you any wins.\cBut we keep trying to get better.\nThat's what makes us Trainers.\n
The Trainers and Pokémon that gather\nhere aren't pushovers.\rThey all have tricks up their sleeves!\c
You're not a Trainer that can be\ntaken lightly!\n
The Pokémon you'll meet here won't\nmake it easy for you to move onward.\n
You've come all this way for Pokémon?\nYou must be dedicated.\c
Your dedication won out.\n
The Pokémon here must battle each\nother all the time.\cThat must be why they are so strong\nin this area.\n
My Pokémon and I are pretty nice,\nbut not when it comes to a battle!\c
I couldn't unleash the real me...\n
When you're raising Pokémon, you need\nto be both firm and gentle.\n
I came here after winning my way\nthrough the Battle Tower!\c
But...\nI had a win streak going...\n
Train more at the Battle Tower...\nThat's what I'll do.\n
We're all good to go!\nWe just have to battle now!\c
Aww...\nI'm out of useful items!\n
We came completely unprepared for\nthis little adventure...\n
I had a revelation this morning.\cI knew that I would have a wonderful\nencounter here today.\c
There's nothing wonderful about this!\n
Is my sense of premonition nothing\nto write home about?\n
I'll use my mystifying psychic power\nto pulverize you!\c
That's what I get for making idle\nclaims...\n
Psychic power is a mystery that\ndefies explanation.\cBut if everything could be explained,\nit would be a boring world.
My Pokémon can destroy anything.\nAnd you think you can win?!\c
We weren't up to the task!\n
Even though my team could break\nbricks and shatter boulders, they\rfailed to dent your spirits!\n
Hear the howl of my iron fists!\nHowdy! I'm crazy for karate!\c
Losing made it clear to me.\nYou're crazy about Pokémon!\n
I love seeing people who love Pokémon\nmore than anything!\n
What do you expect to achieve here?\nI'll be the one to make that call!\c
You've earned the right to be here.\nBoth you and your Pokémon.\n
You may find it odd, but the stink\nof sulfur from the volcanic gas\ris what draws me here.\n
                                                                                     
     
                                                            
                                                                                     
     
                                                            
                                                                                      
     
                                                            
                                                                                      
     
                                                            
                                                  
                             
                                                          
                                                  
                             
                                   
                                                  
                             
                                                              
                                                  
                             
                                                     
                           
         
                                
                           
         
                                
                           
         
                                
                           
         
                                
                                                                                   
                              
                                                            
                                                                          
                              
                                                            
                                                                            
                              
                                                            
                                                                                     
                              
                                                            
                                                                                     
                              
                                                            
                                                                                   
                              
                                                            
                                                                                
                              
                                                            
I just got worked over!\nAnd by a kid no less...\n
...!\nAgain and again...\n
It is our mission to stall you.\nSorry, but we gotta do our job.\c
Losing was a part of my job, too.\n...I feel better by saying that.\n
We won't allow anyone to stop us\nfrom gathering the three Pokémon\rfrom the three lakes.\n
In order for us to bring peace to\nthe world, we must control it!\c
You're too young to understand.\n
Our boss always had plans for\nthe three lakes...\cWhile you were blissfully ignorant,\nour work went ahead...\n
I'll knock your Pokémon into orbit!\c
My mind is going orbital!\n
The Pokémon here has already been\ntaken to our HQ in Veilstone City.\cIt's far too late for a child like\nyou to make any difference.\n
If this mission is successful, we\nwill get a nice bonus.\c
I'm heartbroken...\n
I want Team Galactic to become\npowerful. That is all I want.\n
...You, my friend, are tough!\nI can see why you defy us so...\n
We set off the Galactic Bomb!\nIts blast force was phenomenal!\c
Your Pokémon attack with phenomenal\npower...\n
So, you're tough. Big deal.\nWhat do you think you can accomplish?\cThere's one of you up against the\nentire Team Galactic.\cBy now, another crew should be on\ntheir way to Lake Verity near that\rpuny little Twinleaf Town!\n
I'll punish you in place of our\nboss for defying Team Galactic!\c
Grr...\nI took the punishment...\n
We're Team Galactic!\nThe no. 1 syndicate in the world!\cTo defy us is to defy the universe!\n
...Would you like to join the MAGIKARP\nand flop around in the mud?\c
...Overwhelming!\n
I played you for a child, and paid\na stiff price for my arrogance...\cHowever, you're much too late.\cTeam Galactic has already found the\nsunken island under the lake.\cAnd the Pokémon that lay in it?\nWell, what do you think?\n
You're tough, kid!\nBut, I still pity the likes of you.\n
Well, what have we here?\nA Trainer who's lost their way?\c
You're lost but you won!\nThat burns me up to eleven!\n
You barged right into our HQ?\nYou must not know what fear is, kid!\n
You're the first intruder we've had\nin our HQ!\c
Oh, sure. Why don't you just get\nall cocky about it!\n
Without our special card key, you're\nnot going to get very far.\cWell, non-Team Galactic member?\nWhat's your next move?\n
Who do you think you are?\nDesecrating the halls of our HQ?!\c
A tough little Trainer is what you\nare...\n
We get around in Galactic HQ by\na system of round warp panels.\cDo you think you will ever learn\nthe way they connect? Good luck!\n
Some people, like you, just don't\nunderstand why we do what we do.\cYou don't understand Team Galactic.\nSo why is it that you defy us?!\c
I couldn't understand the\nbattle or your toughness...\n
I went out of my way to deliver my\ncool lines before the battle!\cYou should've let me win!\nGet a grip on reality, already!\n
I'm, like, this close to getting my\npromotion to Commander.\cI'll impress our great boss by making\nyou my newest trophy!\c
...I wish this never happened.
Losing sets me back to square one...\cI'll probably get busted down to the\ngruntiest of the grunts... Humph!
                           
                
                                
                            
                        
                                                        
Intruder alert!\nThere's something smelly about you!\c
Oh, it was my own Pokémon's smell...\n
There's nothing smelly about us!\nWe're on the cutting edge of stuff!\n
Having fun scampering around our HQ,\nyou sneaky intruder?\cYour trail blazing will go out in\na blaze of glory right now!\c
Your trailblazing streak lives on!\n
So what, you have momentum...\nIt's too late. The experiment's done!\n
You should be tired out by now.\nIt's Team Galactic's turn to shine!\c
What? I don't get it.\nWhat's your rush?\n
Pokémon are that important to you?\nIs that what this is all about?\n
Are you enjoying your unescorted,\nunauthorized, and unsettling tour\rof Team Galactic HQ?\c
Let me do what I want!\n
It doesn't matter what happens to\nthe Team Galactic HQ building.\cSoon, all will belong to Team\nGalactic, anyway!\n
Hey there, little Trainer!\nYou're famous among Team Galactic.\cThe order has been issued--we get\na promotion if we put you down!\c
I just blew my promotion...\n
What's so special about you anyway?\cYou're just like any other little kid\nTrainer you can find anywhere!
Our time has come!\nIt's Team Galactic's time now!\c
When's it gonna be my turn...\n
It's too late!\cNo amount of desperation from a kid\nlike you will make a difference!\n
Our time will come.\nA time for only us!\cI'm going to turn back your time!\nTo a time before Pokémon!\c
Gyah!\n
You can struggle all you want, but\nyou can't stop Team Galactic alone!\cIt doesn't matter how many Pokémon\nyou try to use as your tools!\n
Team Galactic is all powerful!\cOnly a fool would show defiance to\nthe mighty might of Team Galactic!\c
Not standing up to the mighty is\nfoolish, you say...\n
It doesn't matter if you're an adult\nor a kid if you have Pokémon...\cPokémon are the equalizers.\nI should have realized sooner...
I can't believe you chased me here...\nOK, let's see how tough you are.\c
Where do you get that power?!\n
Mt. Coronet...\cI might be just a grunt, but even I\ncan tell it has a weird energy!\n
This is our final operation.\nNo one will interfere!\c
You turned the tables on me...\nI call interference...\n
The closer you are to the peak,\nthe closer you are to space!\cSoon, Team Galactic will... Uh...\nTeam Galactic will achieve greatness!\n
Team Galactic will take control of\neverything!\cYou can try all you want, but you\ncan't do anything alone!\c
All you gave me was the taste of\ndefeat...\n
...Is our boss about to ditch us\nand claim everything for himself?
We grunts have been assigned two\nnoble jobs.\cOne, ensure the success of our\noperation at the summit!\cTwo, utterly destroy anyone who\ndares interfere!\c
I don't accept this!\nI will not accept this!\n
Join Team Galactic and then abide\nby our rules.\cThat would solve all our problems!\n
Say, listen, do you realize you're\nbreaking hearts by being successful?\cIt's your fault that Team Galactic\nmembers are in so much pain...\c
See? You've left me brokenhearted,\ntoo...\n
Someone's joy is another person's\nsorrow...\cEveryone be happy and laughing?\nHow ridiculous!\cTeam Galactic should be doing all the\nlaughing!\n
...Our boss is going to do something\nhuge at the summit.\cBut here I am dealing with some pesky\nintruder.\cYou're spoiling the atmosphere.\nYou can lose quickly, right?\c
You're not supposed to work me\nover like that.\n
All my excitement's gone now...\cThis whole Mt. Coronet trip is too\nrough, long, and draining...\n
You've worked so hard to get here.\nYou should be proud of yourself!\cAnd now, I'll send you packing home\nwith only that happy thought!\c
Wh-- How dare you! That's how you\nrespond to my generosity?\n
We couldn't stop you...\nWe'll be discarded as useless...\cOur boss is ruthless that way...\n
Oh, yeah?\nI'll show you something wicked, too!\n
What the?! We're in trouble?!\nBut there's no giving up on me!\n
What just happened?!\nYou're telling me I lost?!\n

Not yet! Your first Pokémon League\nvictory doesn't come easily, kid!\n
I will now concede defeat.\cBut I think you came to see how\ngreat Bug-type Pokémon can be.\cI hope you also realized what you're\nup against in the Pokémon League.\cBattling is a deep and complex\naffair...\n
Dear child, don't assume for an\ninstant that you've won.\n
Well! Dear child, I must say, that\nwas most impressive.\cYour Pokémon believed in you and did\ntheir best to earn you the win.\cEven though I've lost, I find myself\nwith this silly grin!
I can feel your determination.\nYour will is overpowering me!\n
This situation...\nThis is heating up! I'm blazing now!\n
...!\cI wasn't expecting this!\nI wasn't looking down on you...\cBut I didn't think for one second\nthat I'd lose!\cThis is fantastic!\nYou and your Pokémon are inspiring!\n
Hmm...\nNow what should I do...\n
I see...\cYou getting past the three before\nme was no fluke. Your power is real.\n
I can't remember the last time I\nwas put in a corner like this!\n
I won't let this end yet! This match\nis too fun to let it end this easily!\n
...Just a few minutes ago, you were\nthe most powerful challenger.\cAnd just now, you became the most\npowerful of all the Trainers.\cYou are now our newest Champion!\n
You got Pokémon! I got Pokémon!\nLet's see whose Pokémon is the best!\c

Huh? It's over already?!\nI thought I'd win for sure!\n
You're too tough!\nI won't battle you again!\cJust joking! I'll challenge you again\nwhen I level up my Pokémon.\n

Losing makes me mad, but that\nwas still a bunch of fun!

Super outdoor fishing!\nShouting still doesn't help!\c
Gwaaah!\nThis is hurting!\n
Rock 'n' roll!\nWe'll beat it out again!\rOur rhythm of battle!\c
Can you hear it?\nThat's my guitar weeping...\n
Last time, you beat me before I had\na chance to show you my skill.\cThis time, I'll shows you why they\nconsider me an ace!\c
I'm burning with jealousy over your\ntalent!\n
Ace Trainers always work to improve\ntheir natural-born talents.\c
I see...\nI have to concede defeat.\n
Pal Park, huh? I wonder what kinds\nof Pokémon you can see there?\c
You're one enthusiastic Trainer.\n
Hi, traveler!\cI've forgotten your name, but we've\nbattled before, haven't we?\c
You sure showed me up.\n
Oh, we'll ride upon the sea,\nin a boat, just you and me!\cThat's the way of the Sailor!\nWay of the Sailor. You sing, too!\c
Your Pokémon...\nThey're looking good!\n
Oh, we'll ride upon the sea,\nin a boat, just you and me!\cThat's the way of the Sailor!\nWay of the Sailor. You sing, too!\c

The monotony was broken, but...\n
Ah, it's you. I'm bored yet again.\nCare to break the monotony?\c
The monotony was broken, but...\n
I've been training here in hopes of\ngoing to the Pokémon League.\c
I'm shocked...\nNo, really.\n
I've decided! If I finally beat you,\nI'm challenging the Pokémon League!\c
Blblblblugh...\n
It's me again! The harsh sea here\nshould have toughened me up!\c
The world remains as harsh as\never...\n
It doesn't matter how long it takes,\nI'm going to the Pokémon League!\c
Th-this is so hard...\n
How much stronger did your Pokémon\nbecome?\cLet me check for you, OK?\c
I've had my fill...\n
My dragon Pokémon chose to remain\nhere to become powerful.\c
Your battle style...\n
Why have you come back to this spot?\nI want to know what all this means!\c
I see...\cSo that's what it was...\n
See?\nYou've come back again.\cThere must be something that draws\nyou here...\c
The power that slumbers within you...\nIt is rather marvelous...\n
I am indeed a Veteran, but I don't\nuse that as an excuse to slack off.\cI take pride in challenging those\nwho have bested me before!\c
I see...\nSimply outstanding.
I let my bird Pokémon do as they\nwish. And so, we train here daily!\c
Sheesh... I arrive in a new place and\nit turns out to be the Battle Zone...\n
I've cranked up my dragon Pokémon's\nabilities!\cI've been looking forward to seeing\nyou again!\c
Raising abilities alone doesn't mean\nI can win either...\n
What's missing from my game...\nHave you discovered yours yet?\c
I see it now...\n
The urge to battle you again has\nstruck me. Humor me!\c
I shouldn't have paid attention\nto my urge...\n
We've faced many challengers since\nwe met, but they were all weak...\cI relish the tough resistance that\nonly you can provide!\c
I've found a tough adversary in\nyou...\n
Hello again! Please don't hold\nanything back, just like before.\c
Hmm...\n
You're going to win again!\nThat's the future I saw!\c
What I saw in the future turned out\nto be true...\n
Right after this, you will hurl a Poké\nBall in an astonishingly cool manner!\c
Right after this, I have to pay\nout your prize money...\n
This time! This time I will win!\nMy spirit is renewed and strong!\c
My spirit is broken...\n
Do you remember my slogan?\nPeople! Nature! Pokémon!\cThat's right. Harmony is essential!\c
You're A-OK!\n
By battling tough opponents, both\npeople and Pokémon grow tough!\c
My, you are tough.\n
Yo, Pokémon-riding Trainer!\nHow about a rematch?\c
Awesome!\nYou're a real wild child!\n
People still keep coming to us for\nbattles! Why?!\c
OK, we lost.\n
                                                    
                                 
Does this mean I'm only talented as\nan Artist?\n
You're a lucky one...\n
I never thought I'd lose at\nPapa's restaurant...\n
Ohh... How could I lose at dear\nPapa's restaurant?\n
Ack! I lost...\nCheck, please!\n\n
So young, and yet so strong!\nHow very remarkable!
I don't care if I lose.\nI'm still a happy guy.\n
Waaah! You're too much!\n
Wow... You're out there.\n
No one's hurt?\n
Tough, aren't you...?\n
I was with my daddy, too...\n
That's quite the demonstration.\n
Hmm...\nI should have expected this.
My luck's run out...\n
I think I have what it takes to\nbecome a successful model!\n
Hmm... I failed to foresee this\noutcome...\n
You know, I had confidence before\nheading into this.\n
Yeah, like I'm really supposed to\nwin with a Pokémon like this...
We spend all our time battling in the\nblizzards of Snowpoint City.\cWe'll show you how it's toughened\nus up!\c
What's with your toughness?!\n
You've battled all over, you say?\nThat makes you tough, perhaps.\n
I've only been involved with Pokémon\nfor a short time.\cI managed to get this far because\nskilled friends toughened me up!\c
I can't believe how tough you are!\n
If you have wonderful friends, there\nis no limit to how far you can go.\n
Our mission is to implement our\noperations without question.\cIt is all for the new world order\nthat our boss will lead!\c
This won't go unpunished...\n
I'm quite prepared to do anything\nto be promoted.\cOne day, and soon, you will learn\nthe true might of Team Galactic!\n
I won't let you disrupt our research!\nThis is for Team Galactic!\c
I got whipped...\nI look pathetic...\n
Our boss is a scientific genius!\cHe will make the power of mythical\nPokémon his own!\n
Hey, now! Our HQ is a state-of-the-\nart facility!\cA snot-nosed kid like you ought to\nkeep your dirty hands to yourself!\c
You and your Pokémon weren't part\nof my calculations...\n
Our boss is trying to create an\nentirely new world.\cA world only for us!\nFor Team Galactic!\n
Bika bikabika!\nPigachu!\c
Pikachu...\n
Pika...\cI'll need a lot more practice to\nbecome a real PIKACHU...\n
I work at a red-hot foundry.\nWatch out, I'm on fire!\c
I burned out...\n
I toughened up my muscles from\nhonest work.\cPokémon have nothing on me!\n
Well! It's not often we get a visitor\nlike you to the ironworks!\cLet's mark the occasion with\na battle!\c
Fire!\n
The floor panels move automatically.\nWe're pretty proud of them here!\n
Are you maybe getting annoyed by\nwhere the floor panels take you?\c
I'm going down in flames!\n
The sweat of a working man is\nbeautiful to behold...\cThere is also beauty in the tears\nwept from defeat...\n
The toughest of all the grunts!\nThat was me...\n
Arrgh!\nI let some little kid beat me!\n
Sheesh... I should have done the\nfighting myself.\n
Humph! You've toughened up.\nBut you're no match for our boss.\n
Done in by two kids?!\nThis isn't right!\n
I should have kept my head down and\njust watched our warehouse...\n
Fweh... If I didn't run...\nI could've...battled harder...\n
My last Pokémon.\n
I see... I may lose if this pace\ncontinues...\n
Interesting.\nAnd quite curious.\n
I admit that you have pushed me\nto this extreme.\n
This... This cannot be!\nIt's not possible that I lose!\n
I won't accept this!\nThe power spoken of in mythology...\cI didn't just make it obey me,\nI made it my own!\n
I feel like crying...\nThis is so sad...\n
What a tough combination!\nI can't believe it!\n
Oh, yeah? When the going gets tough,\nmy Pokémon get tougher!\n
What just went down?!\nYou're telling me I lost again?!\n
Oh, yeah? When the going gets tough,\nmy Pokémon get tougher!\n
What just went down?!\nYou're telling me I lost again?!\n
Oh, yeah? When the going gets tough,\nmy Pokémon get tougher!\n
What just went down?!\nYou're telling me I lost again?!\n
I'm not giving up till the end!\nI can't give up!\n
What just went down?!\nYou wait! I'll get tougher!\n
I'm not giving up till the end!\nI can't give up!\n
What just went down?!\nYou wait! I'll get tougher!\n
I'm not giving up till the end!\nI can't give up!\n
What just went down?!\nYou wait! I'll get tougher!\n
If I battle now, won't it mess up my\nusual pace?\c
My pace is completely off...\n
If I battle now, won't it mess up my\nusual pace?\c

A battle? Of course, but I need\ntime to get ready.
Sorry I made you wait!\nLet's get started!
I'm terribly sorry, but my Pokémon\naren't feeling well...\cLet's battle another time.
If you want to battle, you need two\nPokémon that are Lv. 30 or lower.\c
That Pokémon...\nIt's been raised really well!
That's it!\nThis is the right move now!
That's awesome!\nYou can battle that way?
You have exquisite timing for\nswitching Pokémon!
A trade? Of course, but I need\ntime to get ready.
Sorry I made you wait!\nLet's get started!
I'm sorry, but I don't have any\nPokémon that I can trade now...\cLet's trade some other time!
I'm trading Pokémon right now.
I finally got that Pokémon I\nwanted in a trade!
You can't trade if you have only\none Pokémon with you.\c
If you want to do something with\nme, don't be shy. Just ask!
You want to mix records?\nSure! But I need a little time!
Sorry I made you wait!\nLet's get started!
Oh, sorry!\nLet's do this another time!
[VAR 0103(0000)]: We were just mixing\nour records.\cI know! [VAR 0103(0001)], would you like\nto mix your records with us, too?
Oh...\nPlease come by anytime.
Thanks for waiting!\nLet's mix some records!
Oh, sorry!\nLet's do this another time!
It's so fun to mix records!
I'm going to keep mixing!
Let's mix it up!
I wonder what's going to happen?
                         
                       
                     
                           
                                                            
                 
                                
                                             
                     
               
               
               
                      
Welcome to the Union Room.\cIf there is anything you need help\nwith, please let me know!
How may I help you?
Which topic would you like me to\nexplain?
In the Union Room, you may battle\nwith two Pokémon of your choice\rthat are Lv. 30 or lower.\cWhen you visit here, we recommend\nthat you bring Pokémon that\rmeet this requirement.\c
You may trade your Pokémon with\nother players.\cMeeting new people could be a\nshortcut to meeting rare Pokémon!\c
You may communicate with other\nplayers and mix your records.\cWhat will happen if you mix records,\nyou ask?\cWe recommend that you try it and\nsee!\cUp to five players can take part,\nso try it with your friends!\c
                                                                                                                                    
You may get together with others\nand draw.\cYou all get to work on one sheet\nof paper at the same time.\cI'm sure a drawing made by friends\nwill be a memorable masterpiece!\cUp to five players can take part,\nso try it with your friends!\c
You can chat with other people\nby selecting “CHAT” in the menu.\cGo out and meet other players in\nthe Union Room!\cLet people know what you're like\nand what you'd like to do.\cMingle, chat, and add to your\ncircle of friends!\c
Oh!\nHere comes someone now!\cInstead of me, why not strike up\na chat with our newcomer?\c
It's rather boring if no one comes\nto visit...\cWhat might we do for\nentertainment...?\c
Do you sometimes get mistaken for\na real [VAR 010E(0000)]?\cI just seem to get that feeling\nfrom you.\c
Hello!\cThat's right!\nIt's important to say a greeting!\cIf someone arrives, let's try to\nbe friendly!\c
Greetings!\c[VAR 011C(0000)]?\nIt's wonderful!\rI really like it, too!\cWhen you meet someone for the first\ntime, the proper etiquette is to\rintroduce yourself.\cBy introducing yourself, you'll get to\nknow about the other person, too!\c
[VAR 011C(0000)] Trainer?\nThat's what you are?\rIsn't that something!\cBut I'm sorry to say, I don't have\nany Pokémon...\cI would rather watch than battle,\nyou see.\c
Oh! Your [VAR 011C(0000)]!\nI would love to have it!\rPlease trade me!\c...\cI was actually joking.\cI don't have any Pokémon, so\nI can't trade with anyone...\c
[VAR 011C(0000)]?\nI can understand you'd want one...\cBut you shouldn't expect people to\nmake trades just for you.\cYou also have to consider what\nPokémon the other person wants.\c
Welcome to the Union Room!\cI'm the only one here now, but\nplease do bring your friends for\rsome fun and excitement!\cIf you have time on your hands,\nI'm also here to chat.\cYou see, I have a lot of time on\nmy hands...\c
I'm quite good at drawing!\cIf it's [VAR 011C(0000)],\nleave it to me!\rNo one's better than me at it!\c
Oh, you're leaving...\c...\cIt makes me feel lonesome...\cPlease do come visit again!\c
What's wrong?\nAre you feeling down about something?\cIf you're feeling blue, it's much\nbetter to have fun with friends\rthan to be alone.\c
[VAR 011C(0000)]?\nYes, please!\c...I do want to join in, but I'm\non duty here, so I can't...\cSigh... [VAR 011C(0000)]...\nI wish I could...\c
[VAR 011C(0000)]?\nMe, too, please!\cBut I need to stay here and attend\nto our visitors...\cPlease enjoy it with your friends!\c
[VAR 011C(0000)]?\nYou're inviting me?\cOh, but I have to stay here and\nattend to our visitors.\cI'm sorry. I'd love to accept,\nbut I really can't.\c
That's right!\cSometimes, it might be better to\njust go and invite other people.\cBut don't get too selfish or pushy\nbecause you want to [VAR 011C(0000)].\c
Yes!\nIt's OK!\cNothing is impossible.\cThink positively and keep your\nchin up!\c
Everyone has at least one thing\nthey aren't good at.\cYou should never try to make someone\ndo what they don't want to do.\cIncidentally, [VAR 011C(0000)] is\nsomething that I would like to do.\c
Good luck! I hope you enjoy\nserious battles.\cYou can't experience ones like\nthis in the Union Room!\c
You want to chat?\cWell, you shouldn't be wasting your\ntime chatting with me.\cYou need to be more active and\ntalk to other players.\cAfter all, you can't make friends\nif you don't talk to people.\c
Where are you?\nUm... Right before my eyes.\cOh!\nAre you maybe an impostor?\cThe real player is somewhere else?\c...That's ridiculous!\nPlease, don't be silly!\rMy word!\c
[VAR 011C(0000)] trade?\nThat sounds fun!\rI would love to as well.\cBut telling me that won't help.\nI can't trade with anyone.\c
If you want to have a [VAR 011C(0000)]\nBattle, you need to be more\rassertive and talk to other players.\cIf you can't assert yourself, you\nmay never get a chance at a\r[VAR 011C(0000)] Battle!\c
