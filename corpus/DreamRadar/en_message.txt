So you're the new researcher?\nI appreciate you coming along.\nI'm Burnet!\nI research dreams.\nAs part of that research,\nI'm investigating a certain place.\nI'm really fascinated by something\nI saw there--the mystery Pokémon!
So! I want you to help me\nwith my research! Whatcha think?\nTry tapping [VAR 0003(0100)]Start Search[VAR 0003(0000)]\non the device in your hand.
OK! Now we're ready.\nLet's be on our way!
[VAR 0003(0200)]If Dream Clouds and Dream\nOrbs are moving quickly, set[VAR 0003(0000)]\n[VAR 0003(0200)]the Nintendo 3DS system\non a flat horizontal surface[VAR 0003(0000)]\n[VAR 0003(0200)]for a short amount of time\nto return them to normal.[VAR 0003(0000)]
[VAR 0003(0200)]Hold the Nintendo 3DS system\nin front of you, and move carefully.[VAR 0003(0000)]
Hee hee! So, whatcha think?[VAR 0004]I had you dive right in\nwithout an explanation, but...\nright now, you're looking at the\nspace between dreams and reality.\nIt's called the Interdream Zone.\nLet's start by having a look around!
[VAR 0003(0200)]Move the Nintendo 3DS system\naround to look at your surroundings.[VAR 0003(0000)]
So, you see a fluffy object floating\nthere like a cloud, right?\nThat's a Dream Cloud![VAR 0004]They materialize in different cycles\nand create energy.\nAnd what I'd like you to help me\nwith is collecting that energy!\nI want you to gather the Dream\nOrbs made by the Dream Clouds.\nSo, whatcha think?\nI'll tell you how to gather them...\nCould you align the crosshairs with\na cloud in the center of the screen?\nWhen a cloud is in your sights,\npress [VAR 0003(0100)][VAR 0201][VAR 0003(0000)]!
Well, how about that?\nYou're amazing!\nThat Beam isn't exactly easy\nto get the hang of, but...\nnot only were you blasting away with\nease, but your aim was spot on, too!\nCan you keep it up and hit the\nremaining clouds with the Beam?\nThe number of clouds left is next to\nthe cloud icon on the Touch Screen.\nOh yeah! The orbs coming from the\nclouds are called Dream Orbs.\nTo gather them, hit them with\nthe Beam.\nUse [VAR 0003(0100)][VAR 0201][VAR 0003(0000)], just like before.
Could it be? That light might\nbe a Pokémon.\nSometimes Pokémon slip into\nthe Interdream Zone.\nWould you help it out?\nYou have to catch it first.\nUse [VAR 0003(0100)][VAR 0201] [VAR 0003(0000)]to fire the\nBeam and stall its movement.\nThen, press [VAR 0003(0100)][VAR 0201][VAR 0003(0000)] repeatedly.[VAR 0004]Keep hitting it with the Beam\nuntil the meter fills up.\nIf you take too much time,\nit will run away.
If you catch a Pokémon, I want\nyou to return it to the real world.\nCould you send the Pokémon you\ncatch to the Trainer you trust most?
[VAR 0003(0200)]Pokémon and items can be sent.[VAR 0003(0000)][VAR 0004][VAR 0003(0200)]After you finish your search,\nselect[VAR 0003(0000)] [VAR 0003(0100)]Send Research Data[VAR 0003(0000)][VAR 0003(0200)].[VAR 0003(0000)]
That Pokémon just now! That's it![VAR 0004]Wow! Encountering it on your\nfirst search is just amazing!\nTHAT is the mystery Pokémon\nI've been looking for!
Great work![VAR 0004]I'm so happy to have met you!\nI really want your help.\nFirst, let's collect the Dream Orbs\nI need for my research!\nDream Clouds usually appear at\na rate of one every five minutes.\nThey don't form while you're\nresearching, though.\nSo visit the Interdream Zone after\nmany Dream Clouds have appeared.\nSo, whatcha think? I'll be counting\non you from here out.
I want to upgrade the device you're\nusing, but I need Dream Orbs.\nI will be able to make more progress\nif I have a lot, so keep 'em coming!
Thanks to you, I finally finished\nthis extension!\nWith this, you will be able to\nfind the mystery Pokémon!\nI want you to do your best\nand catch it!\nIf anyone can catch a Pokémon\nno one has caught before, it's you!\nI believe in you!
I never would have guessed that\nthe mystery Pokémon was Tornadus!\nI just did a lot of research on\nthat Tornadus...\nThe reason it looks different\nthan it does in the real world is...\nit changed its Forme to\nmatch its environment.\nI'll call this Forme...Therian Forme![VAR 0004]Those other two Pokémon I saw...[VAR 0004]they must have been Therian Forme\nThundurus and Landorus.\nI'll get to work on extensions that\nwill let you meet those two.\nI'll need lots of Dream Orbs,\nbut you're here, so I'm not worried!\nI'm counting on you!\nKeep up the good work!
I completed the extension![VAR 0004]With this, you should be able to\nfind a Therian Forme Pokémon.\nYou caught Tornadus, so I'm sure\nyou'll succeed this time, too!\nGood luck!
I knew you could do it![VAR 0004]What you just caught now is\nTherian Forme Thundurus.\nWhat a foreboding appearance![VAR 0004]How wonderful! I'm sure researching\nTherian Forme Pokémon is important.\nIt'll be a big part of unlocking the\nmysteries of the Interdream Zone.\nI'm working on an extension to find\nLandorus, but I need Dream Orbs.\nI'm counting on you!
The extension is ready![VAR 0004]If you search with this, the identities\nof all the Therian Forme Pokémon...\nwill finally be clear.[VAR 0004]I really want you to catch it,\nbut don't do anything crazy.\nI don't want you to get hurt!\nI mean...\nYou're the only one here who is\na decent shot with that Beam.\nKidding...kidding.[VAR 0004]Sentimental stuff makes me\na little embarrassed.\nI mean, you're one of my teammates,\nand you're very important to me.\nOK. I'm counting on you!\nSee you when you get back!
Welcome back! Thank you so much!\nExcellent work!\nTherian Forme Landorus!\nI can barely take my eyes off it.\nWhat's more, researching these\nthree Pokémon will not only...\nteach us much about the\nInterdream Zone...[VAR 0004]it will also shed light on many\nmysteries in the real world as well.\nIt might change everything we\nknow about dreams and reality.\nWhat you found for me may be\na clue about a new dimension.\nThis is a discovery for the\nhistory books.\nMy research is going to get\neven more interesting.\nYou've really gone above\nand beyond for me...\nbut I'd be really happy if you'd come\nhelp when you have a little time...\nlike during breaks from your\nresearch or something like that.\nI mean, no other researchers have\ninstincts as good as yours.\nWhatcha think? Hee hee.[VAR 0004]I can't wait to see what you'll\nhelp me discover next!
Send research data to\nPokémon Black 2 or...\nPokémon White 2 Game Cards.[VAR 0004]Tap [VAR 0003(0100)]Transfer Data[VAR 0003(0000)]\nto start the transfer.
I had a sudden breakthrough\nand developed a new extension!\nIt's called the [VAR 0403(00CD)]!\nGive it a try if you'd like!
I made a new extension\nbetween other projects.\nIt's called the [VAR 0403(00CD)]!\nIf you're interested, test it out.
I made a strange extension.\nIt's called the [VAR 0403(00CD)]!\nIts theme is alternate worlds!\nGive it a try!
The [VAR 0403(00CD)] is ready.[VAR 0004]Something good might happen!\nIf you'd like, try it next time!
I was inspired by the calm\nand by the rage of the sea.\nSo I made the [VAR 0403(00CD)].\nTry it out next time.
The [VAR 0403(00CD)] is ready\nto go![VAR 0004]I made it when the idea popped into\nmy head while playing with magnets.\nIf you'd like, give it a try.
When I was cleaning my drawer,\nI found the [VAR 0403(00CD)].\nI made this extension a while ago,\nbut if you want to, give it a try.
Hey, guess what? I just found the\n[VAR 0403(00CD)].[VAR 0004]I think I might've been researching\nthe rotation of the planet at the time.\nIf you'd like, try it during your\nnext search.
An idea popped into my head\nas I was watching you work.\nI made this new extension.[VAR 0004]The [VAR 0003(0500)][VAR 0403(00CD)] [VAR 0003(0000)]reacts to\nPokémon that are holding items.\nTry it out the next time you go\nout to search.
I've been waiting for you.\nI came up with something neat...\nnew simulators![VAR 0004]I made them so we can research the\ntraits of Tornadus and the others.\nIf you'd like, use them like you'd\nuse any other search extension.\nThey need a lot of Dream Orbs\nto operate, though!

Thanks to you my research\nis moving along nicely.\nAnd I completed a new extension![VAR 0004]The [VAR 0003(0500)][VAR 0403(00CD)] [VAR 0003(0000)]makes it\neasier to find Pokémon.\nIf you'd like, use it the next time\nyou go out on a search.
Dream Clouds appear to generate\nmore energy when in a big cluster.\nMaybe you should search when\nmany clouds have appeared.\nWhen there aren't many clouds, they\ndon't leave as many Dream Orbs.\nPatience is important.[VAR 0004]Take it easy. This should feel like\na leisurely stroll in the Unova region.\nTake some time between searches.
[VAR 0003(0200)]The [VAR 0003(0500)][VAR 0403(00CD)][VAR 0003(0200)] was added![VAR 0003(0000)]
[VAR 0003(0200)]The[VAR 0003(0000)] [VAR 0003(0100)][VAR 0403(00CD)][VAR 0003(0000)] [VAR 0003(0200)]and [VAR 0003(0000)]\n[VAR 0003(0100)][VAR 0403(01CD)][VAR 0003(0000)][VAR 0003(0200)]...[VAR 0003(0000)]\n[VAR 0003(0200)]and the[VAR 0003(0000)] [VAR 0003(0100)][VAR 0403(02CD)][VAR 0003(0000)]\n[VAR 0003(0200)]were added![VAR 0003(0000)]
I have an idea of how to get to\nthe mystery Pokémon, but...\nI need more Dream Orbs and\ntime to develop the extensions!
I'm working on the extension for\nfinding the mystery Pokémon.\nI'm only about halfway done, but\nit's starting to come together.
I'm almost done with\nthat extension!\nI'm just now making some\nfinal adjustments.
Since I saw the mystery Pokémon...[VAR 0004]I've been totally absorbed in my\nInterdream Zone research.
The mystery Pokémon I saw were\ndifferent from other lost Pokémon...\nThey looked as if they were used to\nthe Interdream Zone.
Are you used to operating\nthe device now?\nTo catch a Pokémon, fire the Beam\nwith [VAR 0003(0100)][VAR 0201][VAR 0003(0000)] and hit it.\nThen, press [VAR 0003(0100)][VAR 0201][VAR 0003(0000)],\nand keep hitting it with the Beam.
A way to reach the Therian\nForme Pokémon...\nI've started data analysis, but\nI still need more Dream Orbs.
Development is going smoothly\non that extension.\nI'm about halfway there.\nI'd sure like more Dream Orbs.
I'm working on an extension for\ncatching Therian Forme Pokémon...\nDevelopment is moving right along.\nI'm over halfway done!
Thanks to you, the\n[VAR 0403(00CD)] is almost done!\nI'm making my final adjustments.\nI can't wait to see how it turns out!
I'd like to have a long look at the\nother Therian Forme Pokémon soon!
Landorus and Thundurus--\nI wonder which is easier to find...
Tornadus and the others\nseem to love Dream Orbs.\nI wonder if normal energy\ndoesn't satisfy them...
Your friend is in the\nUnova region, right?\nI hear there's a Gym Leader there\ncalled Roxie, and she's really tough!\nBut I guess when it comes down to\nit, I'm a researcher, not a battler!
Therian Forme... Don't you think\nthat name's perfect for them?
Thanks for the good work!\nYou know, the more you think...\n"I can still keep going,"\nthe more you need to rest!\nPeople say that to me a lot, too...
I'm developing the extension to\nfind Therian Forme Landorus, but...\nI still need more Dream Orbs.\nI'm relying on you!
Thanks to you, the extension\ndevelopment is moving along.\nMaybe I'm about halfway done?
The [VAR 0403(00CD)]'s\ndevelopment is coming along!\nI'm more than halfway done, but I\nthink I need more Dream Orbs.
The [VAR 0403(00CD)] is\nalmost done!\nI'm making some last adjustments.\nHee hee! I'm so excited!
Thundurus's Therian Forme\nwas sure surprising, wasn't it?
I've made progress in analyzing\nTornadus's and Thundurus's Formes.
All that's left is Landorus...\nI'll develop an excellent extension!
I can find Landorus by using data\nfrom Tornadus and Thundurus.
Research never ends.\nTake this, for example...\nIf I didn't know you, I wouldn't\nwant to know much about you.\nBut meeting you just once\nwould create a lot of mysteries...\nlike what your name is\nor what your hobbies are.\nI think it's something like that.[VAR 0004]The more you know, the more\nmysteries there are.
I'm taking a coffee break.[VAR 0004]Watching the steam come out\nof the cup is soothing, isn't it?
I'm shocked how much my research\nhas progressed since you arrived!
You are an amazingly good\nDream Orb gatherer.
I really want some fresh air.\nMaybe I'll go for a walk.
When I think about it...[VAR 0004]the sun we see is the sun\nfrom eight minutes ago.\nThe Interdream Zone could also\nbe further away than it looks, right?
Were Landorus and the other two\nPokémon from the Unova region...\nor were they born in the\nInterdream Zone?
Wait... Wasn't Landorus enshrined\nsomewhere in the Unova region?\nOh, that's right!\nIt's the Abundant Shrine!
I didn't think we could collect all of\nthe Therian Forme Pokémon's...\ndata so fast!\nIt's all thanks to you!
Therian Formes...\nThey're endlessly fascinating.
The Dream Orb's energy\nis astounding, but...\nyou and I, and everything influence\nthe space around us just by existing!\nMaybe that's an incredible power\nas well...
My research is moving along!\nScience isn't about the absolute...\nit's about always moving forward\ninto the next phase!\nThat's why it's endlessly fascinating.
I didn't want to take the time\nto eat, so I made do with coffee...\nDoesn't skipping meals just\nmake you feel ill?\nMaybe I should eat something.
I've come to understand many\ndifferent things through my research.\nBut what's made clear by science\nisn't necessarily the truth...\nit's the way to get close to the truth.\nThat's what I think anyway...
It's nice of you to work so hard,\nbut make sure to get lots of sleep!
Are dreams just noise? Or do\nthey have a vital meaning for us?
I think I'll have a little ice cream\nto cool my head...\nIce cream... That ice-cream cone\nFennel brought was sure delicious.
Maybe the true Forme of Tornadus\nand the others is their Forme...\nin the Interdream Zone!\nBut I can't say for sure yet.
I've been holed up in the lab,\nbut look at it like this...\nDuring the time I've been\nriding on this planet...\nI've traveled thousands of miles\nin space!\nPretty active...right?
You've been a great help!\nThank you!
I feel good leaving those Pokémon\nwith a Trainer that you trust!\nHave you tried sending them\nresearch data yet?\nI can't wait to hear about the\nadventures those Pokémon have.
You definitely gather high-quality\nDream Orbs!
Energy that works the same\nway as Dream Orbs...\nIt hasn't been discovered\nin the real world yet.
Oh! It looks like someone drank the\nShuckle Berry Juice I was chilling.\nThat's too bad. I wanted you to\ntry some.
My inventions haven't been well\nreceived by the researchers...\nIt seems something about my\ndevices is always a little odd.
So, I was doing some\nexperiments on space...\nand I made the hole in the donut\nvanish into nothing!\nSo watch out--there might be\na hole somewhere else in its place.
Dream Orbs sure look yummy...\nThat's a pretty color, you betcha!
Whatcha think would happen if you\nlicked a Dream Orb? Kidding!
The Dream Orbs you gather\nreally help my research.
Dream Clouds get bigger\nand smaller, right?\nIt's that movement that\ncreates energy.\nWhen the clouds are bigger,\nthey probably have more energy.\nYou might want to aim for those\nclouds with the Beam then.
Hmm... I can't stop sneezing.\nDid I catch a cold?\nYou make sure you don't work\ntoo hard, and rest sometimes, OK?
Huh? It felt like space\njust distorted a little right now...
When I counted them,\nI found out that you gathered...\n[VAR 0303(000001CD)] Dream Orbs!\nThanks for bringing me so many!
Something Fennel told me once\nseems like it might be a hint...\nFennel is a friend from college.[VAR 0004]We were both interested in dreams,\nand so we just kinda became friends.\nWell, these days she has been\nstudying Trainers, too, though.
My friend Fennel is researching\ndreams, too.\nI got to know her when\nwe were students.\nHer knowledge and arguments\nwere so impressive...\nI was really surprised when I\nfound out we were the same age.
Could people and Pokémon dream to\nprocess strange experiences?\nOr do we dream because sleep\nputs the brain in a special state?\nThere are still many mysteries.
When I say I study dreams, people\nask me what their dreams mean...\nbut I don't know much about\ninterpreting dreams.
Dreams can lead to breakthroughs\nand discoveries sometimes.\nMaybe dreams are important because\nthe reins are taken off the cerebrum.
When I get hung up on a problem,\nI break it down into its parts...\nthen I look for a clue.\nA change of pace also works!
Welcome back! I'm making good\nprogress on my research, too!
Thanks for the hard work!\nAre you making sure to eat?
Time flies when you're caught\nup in research, doesn't it?
At the current Visoscope level...[VAR 0004]it will take about 45 minutes for all\nof the Dream Clouds to appear.\nThat's just enough time\nto do a little research.
At the current Visoscope level...[VAR 0004]it will take about 70 minutes for all\nof the Dream Clouds to appear.\nJust enough time for a break.
At the current Visoscope level...[VAR 0004]it will take about 95 minutes for all\nof the Dream Clouds to appear.\nThat's just enough time\nto do an experiment.
At the current Visoscope level,\nall of the Dream Clouds will appear...\nin the time it takes for the sun to\nlook like it has moved 30 degrees.\nSo, in about 120 minutes!
At the current Visoscope level...[VAR 0004]I guess it will take about\n145 minutes for all of the...\nDream Clouds to appear.[VAR 0004]Take a nap and dream\nto refresh yourself!
Thanks for the good work!\nJust keep doing what you're doing!
Welcome back!\nHow are you feeling?
Did you know the Dream Orbs\nchange color over time?\nCould collecting the same colors\nof Dream Orbs influence space?\nI feel like the kinds of Pokémon that\nwander in might change, too...
It seems as if there's a relationship\nbetween the color of collected...\nDream Orbs and the kinds\nof Pokémon that wander in...
Are you using support items?[VAR 0004]They make it much easier to catch\nPokémon, so try them out!
If you encounter a quick Pokémon,\nuse the Dragnet Charge.\nIt slows them down so they're\neasier to catch.
I'd like to hear Fennel's thoughts\nabout the Interdream Zone.\nOh, Fennel is a friend of mine.\nShe's a dream researcher.
Have you ever heard of Castelia City\nin the Unova region?\nMy friend Fennel is\nstudying dreams there.\nCastelia's a great place! I even see\nthe Eevee I like so much there!
The device you're using to help\nmy research is called...\nthe Dream Radar system![VAR 0004]That name is a little long,\nso I call it the DRS sometimes.
So, about the Interdream Zone\nI'm having you search in...\nI discovered it by accident\nduring an experiment when...\ntopological dimensions just\nhappened to converge.\nI was blessed by serendipity,\nI guess.
Hold down [VAR 0003(0100)][VAR 0201][VAR 0003(0000)] to fire\nthe Beam in rapid succession.
The Dream Orbs you're\ngathering are vital to my research.\nThey're a sample from\nthe Interdream Zone.\nThanks for always gathering them.\nIt's a big help!
Dream Orb energy also powers\nthe devices for searching dreams...\nso it's vital for my research.[VAR 0004]I condense the Dream Orb\nenergy and use it.
No matter who tried to use it...[VAR 0004]that Beam you're researching\nwould fire in odd places.\nYou and that device are\njust a good match, I guess.
I had several researchers give\nit a try, but...\nthe only one who could master\nthat Beam was you.
It looks like you've got the hang\nof it! Keep it up!
I recommend the Vortex Charge\nfor Pokémon that move wildly.\nIt makes them easier to hit\nwith the Beam.
If you're feeling pressured while\nfiring the Beam...\nuse the Energy Recharge.\nIt makes the time limit longer...\nso you can take your time when\ncapturing a Pokémon.
Hitting several Dream Orbs in\na row makes them easy to gather.
Dream Clouds don't appear\ndirectly overhead or behind you.\nSo there's no need to bend\nyourself in crazy angles to search.
Seems like you find more Pokémon\nwhen there are many Dream Clouds.\nDream Clouds appear at a rate of\nabout one every five minutes.\nIt might be better to wait for many\nclouds to gather before you go.
When you start searching,\ncheck your surroundings carefully...\nso you protect yourself and don't\ndisturb nearby people and space.
The Interdream Zone...\nThe more I learn, the less I know.
I feel like good ideas come to me\nwhen I'm excited.
Welcome back! How did it go?\nEverything is going well here!
Did you know there's a way to\nmake more Dream Orbs appear?\nTry collecting all of a Dream Cloud's\nDream Orbs before they vanish...\nbut if there aren't many Dream Orbs\nat first, more won't appear.
My experimental apparatuses are \nacting up, so I'm inspecting them.\nMaybe it's something like a loose\npart or a Rotom in there somewhere.
Doesn't Dream Cloud have\na nice ring to it?\nI just started calling them that.
Dream Cloud energy production\nis like how rain clouds make rain.
Welcome back!\nA black hole appeared in the cabinet.\nGuess it's someone's experiment.\nI too need to work hard on inventing!
I wonder what makes Pokémon\nwander into the Interdream Zone.\nI feel like when many Dream Clouds\nare in the Interdream Zone...\nyou're more likely to encounter\na Pokémon.
The devices for my research\nare run on Dream Orbs...\nbut I run on nutrients from food\nand the desire to know more!\nYou could also say I run on dreams!
Welcome back!
Thanks for all your efforts!

Whatcha think? Want to try out one\nof the inventions I'm developing?
For that I will need [VAR 0303(000001CD)]\nDream Orbs. OK?
OK! Just leave it to me!
Huh? That'll be hard to do unless\nI have more Dream Orbs than that.
