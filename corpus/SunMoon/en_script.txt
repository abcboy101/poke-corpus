Welcome to the Battle Tree. I’m the receptionist.
How can I help you?
What would you like to hear about?
You can enjoy various kinds of battles with\nmany different Trainers here.\c\nYou can choose either Single Battles, Double\nBattles, or Multi Battles.\c\nYou’ll be competing to see how many Trainers\nyou can win your way through in a row.\c\nIf you lose even once, your win streak will\nend there. You’ll have to start over from zero,\r\nso please be careful.\c\nEach time you defeat a Trainer you’ll receive\nBattle Points, or BP, that you can use to scout\r\nTrainers or exchange for prizes.\c\nThe longer your win streak, the more BP\nyou’ll receive.\c\nDo your best to set an awesome record!
There are three important points you need to\nkeep in mind to battle at the Battle Tree.\c\nFirst, battles at the Battle Tree are held under\nFlat Rules.\c\nAny Pokémon higher than level 50 will have\ntheir level lowered to 50.\c\nSecond, you’ll need a certain number of\nPokémon for your battles.\c\nYou’ll need three for Single Battles, four for\nDouble Battles, and for Multi Battles, each\r\nTrainer will need two.\c\nAnd the last thing, you can’t use more than one\nof the same Pokémon or item in your battles.\c\nHowever, if your partner in a Multi Battle has\nthe same Pokémon or item as you, that’s not\r\na problem.
We hope to see you again.

This is the Battle Royal reception desk!
Would you like to have a Battle Royal?
What rank will you enter as?
Would you like to take part in a Hyper Rank\nBattle Royal match?
Would you like to take part in a Master Rank\nBattle Royal match?
A Pokémon Battle Royal takes part between four\nTrainers, who each bring three Pokémon into the\r\nring for a four-way free for all!\c\nEvery other Trainer in the ring is an opponent,\nand the goal of each match is to win your way\r\nthrough to victory against them all.\c\nOnce any of the participating Trainers have all\nthree of their Pokémon faint and can no longer\r\nbattle, the match ends.\c\nWhichever Trainer is in first place at the point\nwhen the battle ends will be the winner.\c\nPlaces are decided by how many Pokémon\nyou’ve defeated and how many you have left.\c\nYou score higher by defeating more Pokémon\nand having fewer Pokémon on your team faint.\c\nIf you tie with another Trainer based on these\ntwo factors, then the one who defeated more\r\nPokémon will be declared the winner.\c\nIf it’s still a tie, then whoever has the most\nnet HP left will be declared the winner.\c\nTry your best to knock out as many other\nPokémon as possible while keeping your\r\nPokémon from fainting!\c\nNow that we’ve reviewed all that, let me ask\nyou once again...
Then please select the Pokémon you would\nlike to battle with.
I am the Masked Royal!\c\nI heard about your efforts here at the Battle\nDome, and it made me want to battle you!\r\nLet’s do this. Woo!
It looks like you’re all ready for battle.\nThen please come this way.
Then we hope you’ll come back again!
Good effort today!
Congratulations on your win!\c\nYou tried really hard today, [VAR TRNICK(0000)].\nYou and [VAR PKNICK(0001)] both!
You’ll be promoted up to Super Rank for your\nnext battle, [VAR TRNICK(0000)]!
You’ll be promoted up to Hyper Rank for your\nnext battle, [VAR TRNICK(0000)]!
You’ll be promoted up to Master Rank for your\nnext battle, [VAR TRNICK(0000)]!
Now that you’ve won a Master Rank match,\nI’ll present you with a special stamp!
Please accept your BP from the battle.
You received [VAR NUM1(0001)] BP!
We look forward to your next Battle Royal!
That was great fun, oh yeah!\nLet’s do it again sometime!

On How to Heal Your Pokémon\nWhen your Pokémon are injured or suffering \nfrom some status condition, either get them to\na Pokémon Center or use the appropriate \nmedicines on them!
On How to Trigger Abilities\nMethod 1: An Ability may be triggered when the\nPokémon appears in a battle, and its effects will\nthen continue as long as that Pokémon remains\nin the battle.\c\nMethod 2: An Ability may be triggered when the\nPokémon takes an attack from an opponent.\n\nMethod 3: An Ability may be triggered when the\nPokémon is not in a Pokémon battle.
On the Origins of the Alola Region\nThe islands of Alola were given form when\nunderwater volcanoes erupted long, long ago.\nPokémon came to live in Alola when they flew,\nswam, or were carried on the wind to the isles.
On the Number of Pokémon Moves\nAs of this writing, scholars in this field have\nidentified more than 600 distinct moves that\ncan be used by Pokémon in battle.\c\nYet each Pokémon is only able to remember\na maximum of four moves at a time.\nTo learn a fifth move, it must forget one of the\nother moves that it knows.\c\nAdditionally, it must be noted that there are\nalso many different ways through which\nPokémon are able to learn moves.\nThere is still much for us to learn about the\nrelationship of Pokémon and their moves.
On the Classification of Pokémon Moves\nPokémon moves can be divided into three broad\ncategories: physical moves, special moves, and\nof course status moves.\c\nPHYSICAL MOVES\nMoves that attack an opponent, dealing damage\nbased upon the Attack stat of the Pokémon\nusing the move and the Defense stat of the\nPokémon on the receiving side.\c\nSPECIAL MOVES\nMoves that attack an opponent, dealing damage\nbased upon the Sp. Attack stat of the Pokémon\nusing the move and the Sp. Defense stat of the\nPokémon on the receiving side.\c\nSTATUS MOVES\nMoves that have effects other than directly\nattacking another target in battle.

Welcome to the Pokémon Center Café! The time\nin Alola is now [VAR NUM2(0000)] o’clock.\c\nHere in our café space, we provide a moment of\npeace to our customers.
Please come visit us again soon!
What can I get started for you today?
Lemonade
Tapu Cocoa
Moomoo Milk
Pinap Juice
Roserade Tea
Komala Coffee
A [VAR 01C2(0002)] will be $[VAR NUM3(0001)].\nWill that be all right?
This is our café’s original blend, made with\nplenty of freshly picked Alolan Berries.\c\nIts intensely sweet flavor will linger on\npleasantly for hours.
Just one sip and you’ll be hooked.\c\nThis milk is so mellow, yet rich, that it’ll \nmake you wish your mother were a Miltank.
Please enjoy the harmonious tones of sweet\nand sour that can only be performed by Pinap\r\ngrown under the Alolan sun.
We’ve mixed up all different kinds of Berries to\nmake this special Lemonade!\c\nThe refreshing sweetness of it might just\nswallow you!
Moomoo Milk!\c\nGulping it down will bring a smile to your face\nand your heart!
This highly aromatic tea is made with extracts\nfrom Roserade’s favorite leaves.\c\nWhen you drink it, you may find yourself wanting\nto Petal Dance.
Never mind
When your adventures have tired you out,\nit’s time to relax with a hot cup of Tapu Cocoa.\r\nYou’ll love it iced, too.
Pinap Berries don’t deal well with wind or cold.\nHere in the Alola region, however, they can grow\r\nto their full potential under the Alolan sun.\c\nMeaning they’re really delicious.
Enjoy this mellow tea made from the Pokémon \nRoserade’s favorite leaves which we\r\nhave fermented.
This Lemonade is made artisanally by hand, so it\nmust be better than what you get out of a\r\nvending machine.\c\nIt is, right?
Chocolate cream...\c\nTapu Cocoa is so good it’ll make you\ncompletely forget about counting calories!\c\nMaybe I’ll stop worrying about my blood sugar\nlevel and have some, too.
Don’t you think sour juice makes your body\nfeel great?\c\nOf course it’s just a feeling, but I guarantee\nthe taste.
Such a rich and mellow flavor...\c\nTapu Cocoa makes you feel so warm inside,\nit’s as if the tapu are watching over you.
You try to stay cool when you taste the\nspiciness, and you try to act strong when the\r\nsourness hits you.\c\nTry gulping down a glass of Pinap Juice\nlike that!
Coffee from Alola is famous all over the world.\c\nEven the timid Pokémon Granbull, with its scary\nface, can’t help but smile when it drinks some.
Drinking Tapu Cocoa improves your\ncirculation, allowing you to feel more relaxed.\c\nMixing in a little salt is also quite nice.
We’ve pressed the skins of Pinap Berries,\nfreshly picked on Akala, to make this juice.\c\nI ate all the flesh myself! It was crazy spicy!
The bitterness comes pouring out...\c\nJust one sip could knock you out like the\nPokémon Komala.
This Moomoo Milk is made with milk I\njust collected.\c\nAllow it to roll gently across your tongue as you\ndrink it.
When you peel a Pinap Berry, it’ll make your\nfingers tingle.\c\nBut I guarantee this juice is even better than\nthe Berry Juice that Shuckle make!
I became an apprentice to a mysterious barista\nand, after many struggles, I am finally allowed to\r\nbrew some coffee.\c\nWhat I have brewed is this mythical\nKomala Coffee.
We’ve crushed all kinds of Berries and mixed\nthem all up!\c\nHuzzah for you, who ordered this\nspecial Lemonade!
It’s good to gulp down fresh Moomoo Milk.
When you taste Roserade Tea, you’ll first notice\na Sweet Scent filling your nose.\c\nDrink it while it’s hot, before you miss out on\nthe fullness of its aroma!
Here in the Alola region we can harvest\nmany Berries, so we use over 50 kinds of\r\nBerries to make this.\c\nBut I’m actually too lazy to use so many, so I\njust throw in about 47.
This Tapu Cocoa is our specialty here.\c\nBy the way, did you know the English word\n“taboo” may have its origins here in Alola?\c\nBut I’m actually too lazy to check whether\nthat’s true or not, though.
You can get Moomoo Milk from Miltank.\c\nThis is just between you and me, but there’s a\nGym Leader named Whitney in Goldenrod City\r\nwith a Miltank.\c\nI heard that you can get some real tip-top\nMoomoo Milk from her Miltank. \c\nBut I’m actually too lazy to check whether\nthat’s true or not, though.
This is the finest Tapu Cocoa I have ever\nmade in my life. Please savor it.\c\nOf course I will continue to work hard to\nsurpass even this Tapu Cocoa.
In the old days Moomoo Milk was regarded as a\nhighly nutritious medicine.\c\nIf you drink two cups a day, other than the\noccasional tummy ache, you’ll be the picture\r\nof health!
In the old days Moomoo Milk was regarded as a\nhighly nutritious medicine.\c\nIf you drink two cups a day, other than the\noccasional tummy ache, you’ll be the picture\r\nof health!
I’ll be able to brew and offer you the finest\ncoffee only if I continue Pokémon battling and\r\nsurpass my master, a mysterious barista.
By using Berries that have become almost too\nripe to eat, our Lemonade here has a depth like\r\nnone other.\c\nWe’re quite proud of just how sour it is.
We had to battle Roserade to gather all the\nleaves for this tea.\c\nEnjoy it to your heart’s content. If you don’t, my\ngrandson who gathered the leaves will never\r\nfind peace.
We blend beans that we import from\na distant region.\c\nIn other words, you can experience not just one\nnovel flavor but several!\c\nIt might not actually be correct to call this\nKomala Coffee.
Got it! Then if you’ll just give me a moment...
Here you are!\c\nOne [VAR 01C2(0002)] just for you!
I’m sorry, but it looks like you don’t quite have\nenough this time.\c\nBut I really do appreciate how much you love\nour drinks, and I thank you for stopping by!
Here you are. This will make you feel better.
Here you are. This will clear your head.
Here you are. This will wake you up.
All the cool kids headed for their trial at\nBrooklet Hill are drinking Tapu Cocoa.\c\nAgainst Water-type Pokémon, Grass types and\nElectric types can attack efficiently.

All the cool kids headed for their trial at\nBrooklet Hill are drinking Pinap Juice.\c\nAgainst Water-type Pokémon, Grass types and\nElectric types can attack efficiently.
This is the best Moomoo Milk in all of Alola!\c\nI won’t bother you with all the details of\neverything it took to get it here to you, but try\r\nto imagine while you’re drinking it.\c\nBy the way, if you don’t finish it all, can I have\nthe rest?
I brew very strong Roserade Tea because if it\nwas weak, you wouldn’t get the stimulation you\r\nwant no matter how many cups you drink of it.\c\nIf you want to make it weaker, add Moomoo Milk\nlittle by little.
If you’re feeling comatose, it’s time for a\nKomala Coffee. The flavor’s still a work in\r\nprogress, though.\c\nThe water we get up here on the mountain is\ncold, so it’s hard to get the flavor right.
Did you know the “-ade” part of Lemonade\noriginally comes from the Kalos region?
This Tapu Cocoa has been prepared with\nplenty of Moomoo Milk to give it the richest\r\nflavor possible.
Drinking Roserade Tea up here near the stars...\nIsn’t the thought of it delicious?
This is a popular snack in Lumiose City in the\nKalos region.
This candy bar is a specialty from Mahogany\nTown in the Johto region.
This ice cream is a specialty from Castelia City\nin the Unova region.
This is authentic food from Eterna City in the\nSinnoh region.
This snack is a specialty of Shalour City in the\nKalos region.
These cookies are a specialty from Lavaridge\nTown in the Hoenn region.
This chocolate is just ridiculously sweet.
You’re limited to one per day, but have a tea\nbiscuit on us.
We’d like to offer your Pokémon something on\nthe house.
Poké Beans are a specialty in Alola, and\nPokémon love to eat them!\c\nFeed them to your Pokémon in Pokémon\nRefresh, and they’ll become more affectionate!
By the way, do you give your\nPokémon nicknames?\c\nYou know, no one can change those names\nbesides the Trainer who gave them to\r\nthe Pokémon.\c\nIf you trade a Pokémon away, it will always\nkeep the nickname you gave it.\c\nYou better think long and hard about what\nnicknames to give your Pokémon.
By the way, are you saving your progress?\c\nIt can be kind of a pain to save your progress\nsometimes.\c\nIt is important, though, so do try to save often.
By the way, are you going to Festival Plaza?\nYou can connect with other Trainers anytime!\c\nThere’s an exclamation symbol that lets you\nknow when events are going on, too.
By the way, are you going to the Poké Pelago?\c\nMy Pokémon are spending their days on an\nisland far away from me.\c\nI hope they’re having a good time out there...
By the way, are you using the Poké Finder?\c\nIt lets you capture all your\nunforgettable moments.\c\nIt’s so lovely that you can save all your precious\nmemories forever.
By the way, are you using Pokémon Refresh?\c\nWhen I catch new Pokémon, I make sure to\ntake really good care of them.\c\nIt bothers me when they get dirty in battles.\nI spend all my downtime taking care of them.
By the way, are you riding Stoutland?\c\nYou can find all kinds of stuff when you’re\nriding that Pokémon.\c\nI get so into it when I ride Stoutland that I\ncompletely lose track of time.
By the way, are you watching Battle Videos?\c\nI like battling, so I’m hooked on taking and\nwatching videos.\c\nI’ve stayed up all night doing it and been late to\nwork here before!
By the way, are you checking out your\nTrainer Passport?\c\nI get a bit wistful when I look at all the stamps\nI’ve gotten in mine.\c\nI guess I’m just the sentimental type.
By the way, are you using\nQuick Link?\c\nWhen you’ve got too many friends around, you\nmight not know who you’ll connect with.\c\nYou really can connect quickly, though, so it’s\nstill really convenient.
By the way, are you visiting the\nPokémon Nursery?\c\nWhen you drop off a male Pokémon and a female\nPokémon who get along well there for a while,\r\napparently sometimes you’ll find an Egg.
By the way, are you gathering Poké Beans?\c\nPeople give them to Pokémon or roast them\nand use them as coffee beans.\c\nThat’s a foodstuff that has a long history here\nin Alola.\c\nApparently the Poké Beans you can get from\nMohn’s Poké Pelago are the best these days.
When you get to be my age, it really makes you\nthink about things.\c\nThey say time is money, but time itself is\nactually really important.\c\nI mean, you can never buy more time for\nyourself with money, right?\c\nThe present is truly a present. Once it’s gone,\nyou can never get it back.
The reason I run a café is because everybody’s\nalways rushing around and busy these days.\c\nI hope people can come here and relax, even if\nit’s just for a little while.
These days you can easily communicate with\npeople all over the world.\c\nKeep in mind that there are time differences in\nthe world, though.\c\nWhat I mean to say is that it isn’t necessarily\nthe same time for you and whatever Trainer\r\nyou’re communicating with.\c\nDepending on what time you’re trying to\ncommunicate with other Trainers, you might find\r\nit easier to connect to Trainers from a\r\ncertain country.
Once time has passed you by, it will never come\nback. And no one is selling more time\r\nanywhere, either.\c\nThat’s what makes time so important for all\nof us.\c\nWhen you’re late for an appointment, it’s like\nyou’re stealing the other person’s time.\c\nI was often late for dates with my wife, so she\nused to give me an earful!
Time is the same for everyone.\c\nWhether you’re outside playing or laying around\nsleeping, time just keeps on flowing.\c\nHow you spend it is up to you. Remember that\ntime you enjoy wasting is not wasted time.
Vehicles sure are convenient.\c\nYou can get to where you’re going a whole lot\nfaster than if you had to walk everywhere.\c\nSo by convenient, I mean that they’ll save you a\nlot of time.
Each day the sun rises, filling the world\nwith light.\c\nEach of us grows big and strong, bathing in its\nlight so bright.\c\nEach night the moon rises and quietly\nshines down.\c\nEach of us wrapped in peaceful silence, not one\nheart with a frown.\c\nI wrote that poem myself. We take for granted\nthat the sun and the moon keep shining down\r\non us, but we shouldn’t forget to be grateful.
Long ago, months were decided by the moon,\nand days by the sun.\c\nThe sun and the moon have always been\nessential for our way of life.
The little planet we live on revolves around\nthe sun...\c\nAnd the moon revolves around our planet...\c\nHey, have you ever stopped to think about what\nit is your life revolves around?
By the way, are you using Festival Plaza?\c\nYou can connect with someone anytime and\nspend some time together.\c\nDon’t you think all the things you can do at\nFestival Plaza are miraculous?
You can have Pokémon battles with your friends\nor with people you don’t know.\c\nBattles can get so hot that you completely lose\ntrack of time.
Those who keep moving have more time than\nthose who don’t move at all.\c\nThat’s not some kind of riddle, it’s\nscientific fact.\c\nOnce I learned that, I started to more carefully\nconsider how I spend my time.
You got some Poké Beans!
Oh, you’ve given your Pokémon\n[VAR NUM6(0000,002C)] Poké Bean[VAR NUMBRNCH(0000,0100)]s.
Poké Beans make Pokémon happy. I think I’ll\ngive you a present!

Do you know the Pokémon Furfrou?\c\nThey don’t live in the Alola region.\c\nBut if you have one, I’ll trim it for you for $500!
Knock it off!\nYou don’t have $500!
Knock it off!\nYou don’t have Furfrou with you!
OK. Which Furfrou do you want me to trim?
Choose a style.\nI’ll give your Furfrou an awesome trim!
Heart Trim
Star Trim
Diamond Trim
Debutante Trim
Matron Trim
Dandy Trim
La Reine Trim
Kabuki Trim
Pharaoh Trim

Never mind
Leave it to me.\nI’ll take $500 for the trim first.
OK. Let’s get started.\n...Come here, dear Furfrou. ♪
Snip...[WAIT 5] Snip...[WAIT 5] Awwwwwwww. ♪\nFurfrou. ♪ You’re so adorable and cute. ♪
Aww... ♪ Furfrou, you’re super lovely. ♪\n...You think so, too, right?
If you want to try out a different style,\ncome back any time.
Want me to trim Furfrou a bit to maintain its\n[VAR 0194(0000)]?
Want me to return your Furfrou to its natural\nlook, huh?
Knock it off!\nI can’t trim an Egg!
I only feel love for Furfrou.\nI won’t trim any other Pokémon!
Hmmm? Hmmm? That won’t change\nanything, though.
Poodle Pokémon with fluffy fur...\nI don’t see them at all in Alola.\c\nMy fingers are itching to trim Furfrou so bad.

Thank you!\c\nI’ll be good to your [VAR PKNAME(0002)],\nso please be nice to my [VAR PKNAME(0001)]!
Wait! That Pokémon isn’t [VAR PKNAME(0002)].\nI guess you don’t want to trade with me.
Oh, OK.\nIf you change your mind, please come see me.\r\nI’ll be waiting!
Thank you for trading with me!\nI really wanted this Pokémon, so I promise to\r\ntake good care of it!
Sorry! I can’t trade with a person who has only\none Pokémon.
Hello!\nYou’re a Pokémon Trainer, aren’t you?\c\nHave you caught [VAR PKNAME(0002)]?\nWill you trade it for my [VAR PKNAME(0001)]?
Thank you, thank you!\c\nI’ll take good care of your [VAR PKNAME(0002)], so\nplease take good care of my [VAR PKNAME(0001)]!
Hmm... That is not [VAR PKNAME(0002)]...\nWhen you can trade, let me know.
I see.\nIf you change your mind, please let me know!
Yay! I’m so happy!\nI’ll take very good care of your Pokémon!
Uh-oh. Sorry.\c\nI can’t trade with a Trainer who has only\none Pokémon.
I have Bounsweet. The Pokémon is perfect for\nBrooklet Hill.\c\nIf you’d like, please trade it for your Lillipup.
Let’s trade!
Huh? That’s not Lillipup.\nIf you want to trade with me, speak to me again!
Wha—? You don’t want to trade?\nLet me know when you want to trade with me!
Wow!\nLillipup is so cute!\c\nBounsweet is indescribably cute, too!\nSo please take good care of my Pokémon!
Huh? You have only one Pokémon?\nI can’t trade with you unless you have two.
My Poliwhirl... I can’t make up my mind whether\nI should evolve it to Poliwrath or Politoed...\c\nArgh.\nPlease trade it for your Zubat!
Whoopie! I’m super happy!\c\nI’ll be nice to your Zubat, so please be nice to\nmy Poliwhirl!
Zubat! Zubat! Zubat!\nWhat I want is Zubat!

Please trade my Happiny for your Pancham!
Bye-bye, Happiny.\nCome on, Pancham.
Argh! I told you that I want Pancham!
OK.\nMaybe next time.
Please give lots of love to my Happiny!\c\nI’ll take good care of your Pancham and make it\nevolve into Pangoro!
Wherever you are, the rule is the same.\c\nYou can’t trade unless you have at least\ntwo Pokémon!
Hey. Do you have Haunter?\c\nTrade it for my Graveler if you have one.\nI want to see if the rumors about it are true.
My Graveler was born in Alola and has a\nRockium Z!\c\nIf you’d like, trade my Graveler for your Haunter.
No, no, no! If you don’t trade it for Haunter, I’ll\nmake my Graveler use Explosion!
I’ll be waiting!
Whoa! The Graveler I gave you evolved into\nanother Pokémon?!\c\nSo the rumor was true!
Wahaha! Don’t be ridiculous! You can’t trade\nwhen you have only one Pokémon in your party!
Do you wan’ a Steenee?\nI wan’ a Granbull.
Thanks.\c\nI’ll be good to your Granbull, so be nice to\nmy Steenee.
Didn’t I tell you that I want Granbull?
It’s not that easy to say good-bye to your\nPokémon...\c\nIf you change your mind, come see me.

Oh? If you want to trade, at least two Pokémon\nshould be with you.
My Talonflame takes great pride in its Speed!\c\nLet’s trade Pokémon!\nLet’s see. I want Bewear!

If you want to meet mysterious Pokémon that\ndisappeared from the world long ago...\c\nThen you’ll have to find some Fossils first!\nYou do know about Fossils, right?
If you find any Fossils, you can have my pa\ntake a look at them for you.
Fossils are the remains of ancient Pokémon\nthat have been preserved in the ground.\c\nThey can be restored and brought back to life\nso we can meet those ancient Pokémon again!\c\nWhat do you think? It’s pretty amazing, right?
Wow!\nYou’re pretty amazing yourself!\c\nYou’ve found every known Fossil that can be\nrestored into a living Pokémon, haven’t you?\c\nThat is just so amazing that I think I will have to\ngive you a little reward!\c\nThis is your proof of being a Fossil Master!

Route 1\n“The number-one route on the spectrum!”
Trainer Tips\c\nPokémon can gain Exp. Points by battling other\nPokémon. Exp. Points help them grow stronger.\c\nAnd your Pokémon will still get Exp. Points even\nif you catch a Pokémon you are battling against!
Advanced Tips\c\nIf you have Tauros smash any boulders in your\nway, you may be able to reach new areas!\c\nYou could even try exploring Ten Carat Hill,\nwhich lies near the Pokémon Research Lab.
Trainer Tips\c\nThe Pokémon that will appear first in a battle\nwill be the one that you’ve put in the top-left\r\nposition in your Pokémon list.

Route 2\n“A path through many grassy patches.”
Verdant Cavern\n“Designated trial site for the island challenge.”
The Berry Fields\n“All Pokémon are welcome here!”
Trainer Tips\c\nTrying to take another person’s Pokémon makes\nyou no different than a thief!\c\nPoké Balls are only to be used to try to catch\nwild Pokémon that have no Trainers!
Hau’oli Cemetery\n“Ahead lies our cemetery. Within lies eternity.”
Route 3\n“Watch out for flying Pokémon overhead!”
Melemele Meadow\n“A paradise where the Oricorio dance.”
↓ Iki Town
Island Challenge Marker\c\nCongratulations on clearing the trial in\nVerdant Cavern!\c\nNow it’s time to take on your island challenge\nwhile taking full advantage of your Z-Power!\c\nBut remember, if you try using Z-Power and your\nmove misses, it still counts as having used up\r\nyour Z-Power. So you’ll be out of luck after that!
Island Challenge Marker\c\nExplore the meadow carefully, and you may find\nthat there’s more to it than meets the eye!
Trainer Tips\c\nIf you find a Pokémon Egg after you’ve left a\nregional variant at the nursery, it can hatch into\r\nanother regional variant of that Pokémon!

Route 4\n“The path that leads to Paniola Town.”
Trainer Tips\c\nEven among the same species of Pokémon,\nindividuals will have different strengths.\c\nThey may not seem too different at first,\nbut as they grow, so too will their differences!
Trainer Tips\c\nWhen looking at your Pokémon’s Summary page,\nyou can change the arrangement of its moves\r\nby touching a move, dragging it across the\r\nlower screen, and dropping it in a new spot.
Route 5\n“A place of many winding paths and ledges.”
Brooklet Hill\n“Designated trial site for the island challenge.”

Trainer Tips\c\nTraveling together makes your Pokémon grow\nfriendlier toward you.\c\nSome Pokémon even evolve when they grow\nfriendly enough!
Route 7\n“Ahead lies the Dividing Peak Tunnel.”
Wela Volcano Park\n“Designated trial site for the island challenge.”
The Fossil Restoration Center

Trainer Tips\c\nPokémon moves are divided into two categories:\nphysical moves and special moves.\c\nA Pokémon’s physical moves will do greater\ndamage if the Pokémon has a high Attack stat,\r\nwhile a high Sp. Atk stat makes the Pokémon’s\r\nspecial moves stronger.
Trainer Tips\c\nDo you know what the stats describing a\nPokémon’s strengths mean?\c\n“Sp. Atk” is an abbreviation for “Special Attack”\nand shows how strong special moves will be.\c\n“Sp. Def” is an abbreviation of “Special Defense”\nand shows how well a Pokémon will be able to\r\nstand up to special moves.
Route 8\n“See the sea and know true joy.”
Island Challenge Marker\c\nIf you let your Pokémon evolve, they will grow\nstronger, but the timing for when they learn new\r\nmoves will also change quite a bit.\c\nIf you hope to complete the island challenge,\nthink well on your partner’s strengths!
Route 9\n“Short and sweet.”
This way to Memorial Hill\nAnd beyond it, the Ruins of Life
Trainer Tips\c\nOn the screen where you select a Ride Pokémon\nto call, press the +Control Pad icon beside a\r\nPokémon, and you can register that Pokémon to\r\na direction button.\c\nOnce you’ve registered a Pokémon, you can call\nit in no time by pressing that button in the field!
Trainer Tips\c\nThere is a Pokémon that only evolves when it\nfeels a lot of affection for its Trainer.\c\nUse Pokémon Refresh often to care for your\nPokémon and encourage their affection!
Trainer Tips\c\nYou can use a TM as many times as you like.\c\nBy teaching your Pokémon moves of different\ntypes, you can ensure that your team will\r\nalways be able to battle advantageously!

↑ Tide Song Hotel\n→ Route 4
Trainer Tips\c\nHow many Exp. Points you get from a battle\ndepends on the level of the Pokémon you fight.\c\nThe higher your opponent’s level compared to\nyour Pokémon’s level, the more Exp. Points\r\nyour Pokémon will get for defeating it!\c\nBut the opposite is also true: the lower that\nyour opponent’s level is compared to your\r\nPokémon’s level, the less Exp. Points your\r\nPokémon will get for defeating it!
→ Hano Grand Resort\n↓ Diglett’s Tunnel
Paniola Town\n“The town we developed with our Pokémon.”

Um...\c\nI don’t really like to see Pokémon battles where\nPokémon can get hurt...but I’ll watch for you.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Oh yeah, your first battle already!\c\nJust have your Pokémon dish out some moves\nand see who wins. Woo![VAR 0114(0005)]
I appreciate you being willing to take on my\ngrandson here.\c\nI expect a no-holds-barred battle from the\nboth of you![VAR 0114(0008)]
Let me see... So we open the X Menu by tapping\n and then select Save...\c\nAnd that’s how we can save our progress to\ncontinue again at any time, right?
It’s important to save your memories!\c\nYou can save them by jotting them down so\nthat you don’t forget what you’ve done.
Didja know? When a Rockruff really likes you,\nit rubs against you with the stones on its neck!\r\nBut...it does kinda hurt...
Little Hau is a sweet one, eh?\nNothing like his fearsome granddad, Hala!
If you treat your Pokémon wrong, the guardian\ndeity will strike you down with lightning!\r\nBut the children all laugh when I tell them that.
Both sides’ Pokémon will give it their all!
Pokémon have been there for me from the\nday I was born.\c\nI’d guess that Pokémon will keep being there\nfor me my whole life!
That Hau is the kahuna’s own grandson.\c\nBoy, I might just get my hopes up for this battle.\nI hope it’ll be a good one!
The tall grass is like a treasure trove, full of\nall kinds of Pokémon just waiting to be found!
Come on, Hau!\nYou can do it! And you, too, [VAR PKNAME(0000)]!
Ruff ruff!
Raff! Raff!

Welcome back, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]![VAR 0114(0004)]
So!\nWhat kind of Pokémon did you get?[VAR 0114(0004)]
Don’t keep me waiting![VAR 0114(0004)]
Kooo!
Mrar!
Bar?
Oh! I think I’m falling in love!\nSo why did you choose this sweetheart?[VAR 0114(0004)]
Because it’s cute
Because it’s cool
Well then, you picked right...because I’d say\nthis little charmer is definitely cute and cool![VAR 0114(0004)]
The two of you look great together...\nI feel happier just looking at the pair of you![VAR 0114(0004)]

What a stunning sunset!\nAll right, today’s the day that I finally unpack—[VAR 0114(0004)]
Was that the doorbell?\nGo see who it is, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].[VAR 0114(0004)]
Hey there, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\nIt’s about time we set out for the festival, yeah![VAR 0114(0005)]
But first...[VAR 0114(0005)]
Now that you’re a real Pokémon Trainer with\nyour own Pokémon and all, I’ve gotta show you\r\nsomething. Come with me out to Route 1![VAR 0114(0005)]
Have fun at the festival, sweetie!\c\nI’m sure you’ll have a good time with your\nnew Pokémon pal![VAR 0114(0004)]
Me and Meowth will be sure to unpack every\nlast box here—you’ll see![VAR 0114(0004)]

Yeah, over here![VAR 0114(0005)]
So you know that wild Pokémon will sometimes\njump out at you in the tall grass, yeah?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Now that you’ve got [VAR PKNAME(0001)] there,\nyou can not only fight wild Pokémon, yeah...\r\nyou can also try to catch ’em. Woo![VAR 0114(0005)]
I’m going to show you how to catch a wild\nPokémon, all right? Keep your eyes on the prize![VAR 0114(0005)]
Oh yeah![VAR 0114(0005)]
Wild Pokémon do sometimes attack people if\nthey get close, but catch ’em and they’ll join\r\nyour team and be a great help to you, yeah![VAR 0114(0005)]
But if your Pokémon get all tuckered out\nby fighting for you, just head home for a bit.\r\nIf you ask your mom, I’m sure she’ll let you and\r\nyour whole team rest up at home.\c\nOr you could use some Potions![VAR 0114(0005)]
Here’re some Poké Balls and Potions to get you\nstarted out.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Why don’t you have a little adventure of your\nown on the way to Iki Town, yeah?\c\nTake good care of [VAR TRNAME(0000)],\n[VAR PKNAME(0001)]![VAR 0114(0005)]

Hold on!\nYou gotta battle with me![VAR 0114(0007)]
You will battle me, right?\nI know you will! Right?[VAR 0114(0007)]
Yeah, and I won’t lose!
Not now!
All right! This is gonna be great![VAR 0114(0007)]
Very well, then! Let the Pokémon battle begin![VAR 0114(0008)]
Hoo-ee! That gave me chicken skin!\c\n[VAR TRNAME(0000)], right?\nYour [VAR PKNAME(0001)] was awesome![VAR 0114(0007)]
Now that settles it!\nI’m going all out tomorrow![VAR 0114(0007)]
Hm?\n[VAR TRNAME(0000)]...\c\nWould you be so kind as to give me a look at\nthat [VAR COLOR(0001)]sparkling stone[VAR COLOR(0000)] you have there?[VAR 0114(0008)]
Could it be?![VAR 0114(0008)]
Tutu, isn’t that...[VAR 0114(0007)]
You were rescued by Tapu Koko at the bridge—\nisn’t that what I heard, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0008)]
Yeah, it rescued me
That’s when I got that stone
So it even deigned to give you a stone...\c\nPerhaps you are here in Alola, [VAR TRNAME(0000)],\nbecause this is where you are meant to be.\c\nAllow me to borrow this stone for now.\c\nFret not! I’ll return it to you tomorrow evening.[VAR 0114(0008)]
It would seem that you have the makings of\na fine Trainer.\c\nYou must do us the honor of joining in our\nfestival tomorrow![VAR 0114(0008)]
First I’ll make sure you get back home safe\ntoday, though, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].\c\nLillie, you two should come with us, too, yeah.\c\nWouldn’t want to go losing you twice in one day.\nYou or that precious Pokémon of yours![VAR 0114(0005)]
Yes...\nI will keep an eye on...[VAR 0114(0006)]
Pew!
Oh, you! Would you not try to escape the very\nmoment that you were told not to wander off![VAR 0114(0006)]

The Alola region is made up of our four islands.\c\nAnd each island has its own guardian Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Our festival today is held to express our thanks\nto these great Pokémon guardian deities for\r\nalways remaining by our sides.[VAR 0114(0008)]

Hoo!
Grrr!
Arf!
Hold on...\nDidn’t anyone explain to you about tonight?![VAR 0114(0007)]
Oh yeah, right on time![VAR 0114(0005)]
But to what exactly?[VAR 0114(0006)]
Pew!
A full-powered festival for Pokémon battling!\c\nWe battle in the name of Tapu Koko, pitting our\nbest moves against one another in friendly\r\ncompetition to please our guardian. Woo![VAR 0114(0005)]
So you two will be taking part in the battle?\c\nI don’t like seeing Pokémon fight one another,\nsince they so often end up getting hurt...\c\nBut it seems like this is an important event, so\nI’ll be sure to watch you both.[VAR 0114(0006)]
[~ 11]
Your Pokémon have fought for you, so show\nthem the same care in return, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].\c\nAllow me to heal them for you this time.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Are you ready for this Pokémon battle?[VAR 0114(0008)]
When you feel that you’re ready, come back\nand tell me.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Then let’s begin![VAR 0114(0008)]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Text File : 53

For all life on our islands...[VAR 0114(0008)]
and for those who undertake the\nisland challenge with joy in their hearts...[VAR 0114(0008)]
we pray for your protection...\nfor them and all Melemele.[VAR 0114(0008)]
May this Pokémon battle be an offering to\nour island’s guardian deity—Tapu Koko![VAR 0114(0008)]
Before you stands Hau—grandson\nto the kahuna.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Before him stands [VAR TRNAME(0000)]—\none who has met with Tapu Koko.[VAR 0114(0008)]
What?!
What a curious little thing Tapu Koko is!\nHah, that’s just typical of it!
[VAR PKNAME(0001)]!\nTake care of my little [VAR TRNAME(0000)]![VAR 0114(0004)]
As long as we both have a good time,\nthen I think we can call it a great battle, eh?[VAR 0114(0007)]
[VAR TRNAME(0000)]! Hau!\nBring forth the power of your Pokémon![VAR 0114(0008)]
Hoo-ee! Another great battle this year.
I bet Tapu Koko liked it, too.
Phew...\nThat was awesome, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]![VAR 0114(0007)]
That was a really great battle!\nI had a blast fighting you![VAR 0114(0007)]
It was a good battle.\nWith this, even Tapu Koko...[VAR 0114(0008)]
Ko-ko-kooo!
Ho! You heard it yourself!\nTapu Koko’s song of approval.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Oh, I nearly forgot! I think it is time you take\nthis, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].[VAR 0114(0008)]
Your [VAR COLOR(0001)]Z-Ring[VAR COLOR(0000)], a mysterious armband that\ncan draw out the power that lies deep\r\nwithin Pokémon...\c\nIt can bring forth their [VAR COLOR(0001)]Z-Power[VAR COLOR(0000)]![VAR 0114(0008)]
You slipped the Z-Ring onto your wrist!
We kahunas can make them by refining stones\nlike the Sparkling Stone that you received from\r\nTapu Koko.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Although until you collect more Z-Crystals\nduring your island challenge, you will not be able\r\nto draw out the Z-Power of your Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0008)]
And yet you have already received that\nSparkling Stone...\c\nIt seems Tapu Koko took quite a liking to you...\nor perhaps it has a mission for you.[VAR 0114(0008)]
In other words, it’s time for you to get out there\nand start your [VAR COLOR(0001)]island challenge[VAR COLOR(0000)]!\c\nIf you visit every island, maybe you’ll figure out\nwhat that mission is.[VAR 0114(0005)]
The island challenge?
Every island?
Four islands![VAR 0114(0005)]
You’ll travel to each of the four islands here\nin the Alola region.\c\nThe island challenge is about aiming to be the\nstrongest Trainer—\r\nthe [VAR COLOR(0001)]island challenge champion[VAR COLOR(0000)]. Woo![VAR 0114(0005)]
Sounds great, right?\nI can’t wait to have a real adventure![VAR 0114(0007)]
I’ll explain about the island challenge later![VAR 0114(0005)]

Tapu Koko is amazing, isn’t it?\c\nI hope I can meet it again someday and thank it\nfor saving Nebby...[VAR 0114(0006)]
Pew!
Me, too
Oh yeah?
It saved you as well, didn’t it?\nAnd left you with that sparkling stone...\r\neven though you’re a stranger to this place.[VAR 0114(0006)]
You know, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]...\nit did save your life, too.\c\nAnd it even gifted you that sparkling stone...\neven though you’re a stranger to this place.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Suppose it’s time we get you kids home, yeah?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Then I suppose this is good-bye...[VAR 0114(0006)]

Maybe it would be a good idea for you to try\nthat island challenge thing...\c\nIt’s something you can only do in Alola, right?[VAR 0114(0004)]

Oh. Um...[VAR 0114(0006)]

“Hey there, Lillie!\nBring me that great new Trainer. Woo!”[VAR 0114(0006)]
So I’m here to show you the way to his Pokémon\nlab, if you’ll come with me.[VAR 0114(0006)]
It’s, um... It’s this way.[VAR 0114(0006)]
[VAR TRNAME(0000)]![VAR 0114(0004)]
Here. A little pocket money for you.\nDon’t go wasting it on anything too silly![VAR 0114(0004)]
Oh! Well done, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].\nYou’re already making friends, aren’t you?\r\nAnd what a cute little friend you’ve found!\c\nI knew Alola would be a great place for us.\nWe just keep meeting wonderful people here![VAR 0114(0004)]
M-me? Well, thank you...\c\nMy name is Lillie.\nIt’s very nice to meet you.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Looks like it’s finally your time to shine, sweetie!\c\nEnjoy yourself out there with [VAR PKNAME(0001)].\nAnd don’t be gone too long![VAR 0114(0004)]
You...have a very nice mother, don’t you?[VAR 0114(0006)]
We should get going.\nI’ll show you to the Pokémon Research Lab.[VAR 0114(0006)]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Text File : 59

You can only reach the professor’s lab by\ntreading through the tall grass here.\c\nHe says he can research moves better when\nhe is so surrounded by Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Since I’m not a Trainer, though, I have to rely on\nusing Repels all the time.\c\nYou do know that using Repel keeps Pokémon\nfrom attacking, right?[VAR 0114(0006)]
A-and about Nebby...\c\nOh. I mean...Cosmog.\c\nCosmog seems to be a very rare Pokémon.\nIt came from far, far away.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Pew!
It seems to have a very strange power...\c\nIt used that power to save me once when I was\nin danger.[VAR 0114(0006)]
But some...other people want Cosmog for\nthemselves, to use that power.\c\nThat’s why only the professor and Kahuna Hala\nand other people I can trust know about it...[VAR 0114(0006)]
Can you keep a secret?\c\nCan you not tell anyone else about Nebby\nor what happened on that bridge? Please...[VAR 0114(0006)]
Not that way![VAR 0114(0006)]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Text File : 60

Ahh...\nThere they go again...[VAR 0114(0006)]
The Pokémon Research Lab has its own unique\ncharm, as I think you might agree.\c\nI’ve actually been, um, imposing on the\nprofessor here for the past three months.\c\nI’m not much of an assistant, but it’s the least\nI can do to pay him back for letting me stay.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Maybe I’d be more help if I were a real Pokémon\nTrainer, too...[VAR 0114(0006)]
Raaaa-oooooohhh! Raff ruff!
Oh yeah, Rockruff! Let’s go!\nGive it everything you’ve got!\r\nMy body is ready. Woo![VAR 0114(0005)]
The professor...\c\nHe never stops researching moves.\nNot even...inside the lab itself.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Looks like we’ll have to patch the roof again...[VAR 0114(0006)]
And I had just washed his lab coat and finally\ngotten it clean, too. Now it’ll be in shreds...\r\nand I’m no good at mending clothes...\r\nso he’ll just have to buy another new one...[VAR 0114(0006)]
We should probably go in before he does\nany more damage...[VAR 0114(0006)]
Please don’t wander off![VAR 0114(0006)]

Hey there, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\nThanks for getting h[VAR GENDBR(0000,0202)]imer for me, Lillie![VAR 0114(0005)]
Of course. However I can be a help...\nI am supposed to be your assistant, right?[VAR 0114(0006)]
Rockruff’s moves were just so stylin’, and I was\nmaking good progress with my research.\c\nSay, [VAR TRNAME(0000)], lemme see your Pokédex\nfor a second, yeah?[VAR 0114(0005)]
So what do you think of the place?\nNot bad, right?[VAR 0114(0005)]
But that’s not why I called you here, eh?\nHere! It finally arrived![VAR 0114(0005)]
“It”...?[VAR 0114(0006)]
What’s wrong, Lillie? Don’t make me do all\nthe talking![VAR 0114(0005)]
See, there’s this Pokémon inside your Pokédex\ncalled Rotom...[VAR 0114(0005)]
Really?
Rotom?
Oh, I can tell you about Rotom.\c\nIt is a peculiar Pokémon, with a body made up\nof something like electricity.\r\nIt can take up residence in machines.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Yeah, buddy! And to put that crazy skill of\nRotom’s to work...
It’s the next generation of Pokédexes, but it’s\nonly complete once Rotom has gone into this\r\nbody specially developed for it!
A whole new way for people and Pokémon\nto communicate. Woo!\c\nAnd there’s only a few of these beauties out in\nthe world so far!
And now if I power up your Pokédex with the\nparts that I just got in...[VAR 0114(0005)]
Kzzzt!
Hey now! Sorry ’bout that, Rotom.\nGuess I surprised you?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Zzzt?
Rotom!\c\nHere, boy! I powered up your favorite ’Dex!\c\nGive [VAR TRNAME(0000)] here a Helping\nHand, yeah?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Kzzzttt!!
See, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]?\nNow Rotom can talk right to you!\c\nFrom what I can tell, yeah, it looks like Rotom\nhas taken a liking to you![VAR 0114(0005)]
[~ 21]
And this will help how exactly?[VAR 0114(0006)]
[VAR TRNAME(0000)] hasn’t been here in Alola too\nlong yet.\c\nSo I decided to give h[VAR GENDBR(0000,0202)]imer this special Rotom Dex\nto help h[VAR GENDBR(0000,0202)]imer navigate around.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Thank you very much
Nice to meet you, Rotom!
You can see where you’re headed just by\nlooking at Rotom, and if you give it a little tap,\r\nyou can even check out the [VAR COLOR(0001)]Town Map[VAR COLOR(0000)]![VAR 0114(0005)]
A-lo-la![VAR 0114(0007)]
The salty breeze sang to me and brought me\nhere to you![VAR 0114(0007)]
Whoa-ho-ho![VAR 0114(0007)]
Is that a loft?! That’s awesome![VAR 0114(0007)]
No, it’s not! It’s private!\c\nThe professor has been kind enough to let me\nuse it...[VAR 0114(0006)]
If you see a person or a Pokémon\nwho needs help, you just help them...\r\nRight, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]? Hau?[VAR 0114(0005)]
And that’s why I’m letting Lillie stay up there\nin the loft.[VAR 0114(0005)]

So that’s the Rotom Dex, eh?\nIt’s kinda cute.[VAR 0114(0007)]
All right, there are some important things you\nneed to know about the [VAR COLOR(0001)]island challenge[VAR COLOR(0000)].[VAR 0114(0005)]
The island challenge is your chance to become\nthe strongest Trainer around—the [VAR COLOR(0001)]island[VAR COLOR(0000)]\r\n[VAR COLOR(0001)]challenge champion[VAR COLOR(0000)]. Woo!\c\nIt’s a great adventure for you and your Pokémon\nto go on together![VAR 0114(0005)]
There are four main islands that make up Alola,\nand a kahuna for each one of them.\c\nIf you wish to be recognized by the kahunas as\nworthy, it’s said you must clear [VAR COLOR(0001)]seven trials[VAR COLOR(0000)].[VAR 0114(0006)]
[VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\c\nI want you and [VAR PKNAME(0001)] to get out there\nand give it a shot!\c\nYou were able to fully use your Pokémon’s\nmoves in your very first battle.\c\nI think you must have a talent for drawing out\nPokémon’s strengths, yeah.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Then yeah, I’ll do it!
Um...I’m not really sure...
Come on!\nYou’ve gotta do it![VAR 0114(0007)]
You did just come to Alola, yeah, so I guess it’s\nhard for you to relate to our customs, huh?[VAR 0114(0005)]
But as someone who’s dedicated my life to\nstudying Pokémon moves, I really want to see\c\nyou out there meeting all kinds of Pokémon on\nyour island challenge.\c\nC’mon and give it a shot, cousin![VAR 0114(0005)]
Oh yeah! As someone who’s dedicated my life\nto studying Pokémon moves, I really want to see\c\nyou out there meeting all kinds of Pokémon on\nyour island challenge![VAR 0114(0005)]
Here! Everybody on the island challenge gets\none of these island challenge amulets.[VAR 0114(0005)]
I got one from my gramps, too![VAR 0114(0007)]
All right then, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]! You too, Hau!\nGet a move on![VAR 0114(0005)]
OK!
What?
To the Trainers’ School![VAR 0114(0005)]
You’ve gotta learn the basics of being a\nPokémon Trainer through Pokémon battling.\c\nIt’s a long road to becoming the island challenge\nchampion, and the Trainers’ School is the\r\nfirst step![VAR 0114(0005)]
What about you, Hau?[VAR 0114(0005)]
I’m good. I just wanna play with my Pokémon!\nI mean, uh, train with them. Right![VAR 0114(0007)]
The island challenge...\c\nSo this is how the people of Alola connect with\nthe world around them.[VAR 0114(0006)]
And the way that you connected so quickly\nwith [VAR PKNAME(0001)] and Rotom, too, even\r\nthough you just met...\c\nEven Nebby likes you! I guess there’s something\nabout you that makes Pokémon feel comfortable\r\nwhen they’re by your side.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Lillie!\nYou take care of [VAR TRNAME(0000)], yeah?\c\nUntil [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0100)]she gets used to Rotom, help h[VAR GENDBR(00FF,0202)]imer find h[VAR GENDBR(00FF,0202)]iser\nway around![VAR 0114(0005)]

If you talk to the woman at the counter, she can\nrestore your Pokémon to perfect health.[VAR 0114(0006)]
It’s amazing, isn’t it?\c\nI can’t stand seeing Pokémon in pain...[VAR 0114(0006)]
You can also deposit Pokémon in the PC here\nor take them out.[VAR 0114(0006)]
And at the Poké Mart you can buy all kinds of\nitems that should help you during your trials.\c\nI’d take a look, if I were you.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Over there is the café area.[VAR 0114(0006)]
I like to relax there sometimes with a frosty\nglass of Moomoo Milk.[VAR 0114(0006)]
I read something in a travel guide about\nAlola once...\c\nApparently each Pokémon Center in Alola offers\na different selection of drinks.\r\nI wonder how they pick what to serve?[VAR 0114(0006)]
The cafés may also offer more than just drinks.\c\nI’ve heard they also sell special treats and that\nsometimes the staff have tips for trial-goers.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Pew!
We should head to the Trainers’ School next.\c\nBut have your Pokémon taken care of first if\nyou think that they need a little aid.[VAR 0114(0006)]

Hey there, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\nI must’ve passed you two somehow, yeah?[VAR 0114(0005)]
But welcome to the Trainers’ School, the place\nto learn how to be a Pokémon Trainer![VAR 0114(0005)]
[~ 2]
[~ 3]
Professor Kukui!\nIs this the child you told me about?
Yeah. Put h[VAR GENDBR(00FF,0202)]imer through the wringer, Teach![VAR 0114(0005)]
Four Trainers![VAR 0114(0005)]
You’ve got to beat four Pokémon Trainers here\nat the school, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\c\nThe experience will surely help you and your\nPokémon grow stronger, yeah.\c\nActually... Speaking of experience, why don’t\nyou take this.[VAR 0114(0005)]
If you keep that Exp. Share on, yeah,\nall the Pokémon on your team can get\r\nExp. Points from battle.[VAR 0114(0005)]
The Trainers who will take part in this lesson\nmay be inside or outside the school.
You may also want to visit our classrooms.\nYou’ll be sure to learn a lot.
[~ 11]
[~ 12]
All right. Let the lesson begin!
She may not look all that tough, but that teach\ntrains her kids right!\r\nOne of her students is even a captain![VAR 0114(0005)]
If you want a bit of advice from me, here’s\nsomething that might help.\c\nOnce you’ve fought a species of Pokémon once,\nyou can easily see what types of moves will\r\nwork best on it in your next battle.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Wandering about in the tall grass to meet\nlots of different Pokémon’ll help with that!\r\nBattle all the time, oh yeah![VAR 0114(0005)]
Seeing a Pokémon in pain makes my own heart\nseem to ache.\c\nYou can come talk to me anytime that you want\nyour team’s health restored. I’m happy to help.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Let me take care of poor [VAR PKNAME(0001)], OK?[VAR 0114(0006)]
Please try not to push your Pokémon too hard...\nUm...I mean...if you don’t mind...[VAR 0114(0006)]

Boy, you’re awful close!
Stand so close and I’ll wanna battle you.\nIs that what you want? Huh? Is it?
You sure? I heard that you’re supposed to\nbeat us as some kinda lesson or something.
Then I’ll show you how I like to fight...\nup close and personal!
Your style of battle...\nIt’s pretty great, you know?
Oooh, so close!\nIt makes me want to battle!
You know, as a Trainer you can feel a lot closer\nto someone after battling them.\c\nBut how close you have to get to a Trainer\nbefore they challenge you to a battle can\r\ndepend on what kind of Trainer they are!
You can tell me anytime that you want your\nteam’s health restored, and I’ll help you.\c\nSeeing a Pokémon in pain makes my own heart\nseem to ache...[VAR 0114(0006)]
Let me take care of poor [VAR PKNAME(0001)], OK?[VAR 0114(0006)]
Please try not to push your Pokémon too hard...\nUm...I mean...if you don’t mind...[VAR 0114(0006)]
I’ll teach you the tactics that I learned\nhere at school...by beating you with them!
Poisoning an opponent will slowly drain its HP.\nParalyzing ’em can prevent its attacks.\c\nPokémon moves can have all kinds of effects,\nso watch out for them!
I’ve been waiting here for you because the\nteacher told me to.\c\nIf you beat my Pokémon, I’ll give you a simple\nbut very important lesson.
If you use items or moves to boost your team’s\nstats, you can increase how much damage your\r\nPokémon deal and lessen how much they take.\c\nIf you ever want to be a Pokémon champion,\nthen that’s a total basic. You got that?
You wanna know why I’m standing here?\nBecause I’m the strongest, that’s why!\c\nI won’t even bother battling you unless you can\nbeat everyone else here!
You wanna know why I wanna be strongest?\nBecause it’s cool to be strong, duh!
Ahh... Now that wasn’t cool at all...\nMaybe I should aim for being pretty instead?
But fine! Whatever!\c\nI can admit it when I’m beat.\nI’ll give you a reward even.\r\nTake this Technical Machine!
OK. First thing to know about TMs.\c\nTechnical Machines teach new techniques.\nThey’ll give your Pokémon a new move in a flash.\c\nBut if your Pokémon can’t learn the move in a\nTM, then too bad. You are up the creek, pal.\c\nSecond thing to know about TMs.\c\nYou can use a TM as many times as you want,\non as many different Pokémon as you want.\c\nThey don’t wear out or get used up.\nPretty nice gift from me, huh?
Oh, that’s the school bell.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Attention, all students...\c\nWould [VAR TRNAME(0000)] please come to the\noffice on 2F?\c\n[VAR TRNAME(0000)] to the 2F office, please.
What terrible thing did you do to get called to\nthe office so soon?[VAR 0114(0006)]
Nothing!
Well...
That’s what you say...[VAR 0114(0006)]

[VAR TRNAME(0000)]...\c\nI can’t believe that you...
beat all of my students! Fantastic!
After seeing such a performance, I think I’d like\nto battle you myself!\c\nWhat do you say?\nAre you ready to take me on?
As a teacher, I’ve got to see for myself what\nyou did to beat four of my students!
You must be joking!\c\nYou do know how much experience you could\ngain from battling me, right?
Nice! Maybe you’d like to take over as teacher\nhere for me!
All joking aside, though, I do want you to take\nthese from me...\c\nIt’s a little reward for beating me.
They’re Great Balls. Great Balls are better at\ncatching Pokémon than normal Poké Balls.
Know your Pokémon and know their moves.\nThose are the basics of being a Trainer![VAR 0114(0005)]

My trial is held in Verdant Cavern.\nThe trial of Captain Ilima.[VAR 0114(000C)]
You can find Pokémon living everywhere, even\nin the patches of tall grass in Hau’oli City.\c\nPerhaps you’ll want to fill out your team a bit\nbefore attempting my trial?[VAR 0114(000C)]
I sincerely look forward to your challenge.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Oh yeah!
I reported to the folks upstairs about that\nTauros blocking the road out front again.

Isn’t that awesome, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]?\nYou got a Poké Finder![VAR 0114(0007)]
So, like, what’s a Poké Finder?[VAR 0114(0007)]
The Poké Finder is a tool that lets you take\nphotos of Pokémon.\c\nRotom will help point out places where you’ll\nbe able to take photos, too.\c\nHere, I’ll read you the instruction manual.\c\n“Tap on Rotom or press .”\nYup, that’s all it says. Quite simple, isn’t it?
Man, that Rotom Dex is cool!\c\nIt’s like a whole nother partner, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\nI mean, on top of your Pokémon partner![VAR 0114(0007)]

There! [VAR TRNAME(0000)], I’ve got this ornery\ncreature calmed again, for now.\c\nWant to try giving him a little pat again?\nThat’s the only way he’ll get used to you.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Moo?
Maybe old Tauros here can feel your love for\nPokémon. He sure seems happy to know you.\c\nAnd yet...\c\nIt still seems to me like Tauros wants to stretch\nhis legs on his own island challenge! Ha![VAR 0114(0008)]
What! You want to play tag, now?\nThe Melemele kahuna never loses, friend![VAR 0114(0008)]

You got a lame bunch of Berries...\nNow Team Skull’s your adversaries!\c\nTakin’ Berries off your hands\nis just the start of our plans, yo![VAR 0114(0031)]
Let’s get Figy with it!\nWatch while I Nanab me some Berries![VAR 0114(0032)]
I’ll share my Berries for free with any Pokémon,\nbut you’ll not have a single one from me!
So, what? I’m lower than a Pokémon?!\nI already got self-esteem issues, man![VAR 0114(0031)]
And what are you looking at, huh?!\nHuh? Huh? HUH?\c\nYo, hold up, you’re—![VAR 0114(0031)]
You got a bone to pick with us, homie?\c\nYou and Cap may have beat us at the Marina,\nbut you won’t be so lucky if we get serious, yo![VAR 0114(0032)]
I appreciate your concern, child.\c\nBut these Team Skull punks do nothing but talk\nbig and act small.\c\nYou carry on with your island challenge.\nDon’t give them a moment’s notice.
Yo, we’re standing right here! At least act a\nlittle bit afraid or something, y’know?![VAR 0114(0031)]
Yo, you tryin’ to run away? We’re gonna hafta\ntake your Pokémon along with the Berries![VAR 0114(0032)]

Yo, check out how hardheaded Team Skull\nGrunts can be![VAR 0114(0032)]
Yo, for real?!\nYou best stop trying to act hard, kid!\c\nYo, I’m so annoyed right now, homie! Let’s go\nmess with Ilima again![VAR 0114(0032)]
Aww yeah, let’s do it!\nVerdant Cavern is pretty close by anyway.\c\nAnd you!\c\nYou better listen to what my boy says\nand drill it into that thick skull of yours!\r\nFor real! You’d better not forget, numskull![VAR 0114(0031)]

Ho! You and that [VAR PKNAME(0000)] there did\nquite the number on him!\c\nAllow me to thank you for driving off those\nTeam Skull numskulls.
Oran Berries can restore some of a Pokémon’s\nHP for them.\c\nYou can feed a Berry to a Pokémon, or let one\nhold a Berry and they’ll eat it when they need it.
If you’re ever looking for more Berries,\nyou won’t have to look Berry hard!\c\nWa ha ha ha!\c\nBerries grow like...well, like weeds here in Alola,\nso feel free to pick up any you find!

You know that Verdant Cavern place, right?\nI guess it’s kinda, like, sacred to Tapu Koko.[VAR 0114(0007)]
You aren’t even allowed to go into it unless\nyou’re on your island challenge.[VAR 0114(0007)]
Oh yeah! Almost forgot!\c\nI have something pretty amazing to share with\nyou, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]. You lucky thing![VAR 0114(0007)]
Revives are solid items to have!\nIf your Pokémon faints in battle and can’t go on,\r\nthen a Revive will perk ’em right back up!\c\nBut you probably won’t find Revives here.\nDidja know that Poké Marts sometimes sell\r\ndifferent things? And not just that!\c\nThe two clerks at the counter even sell\ndifferent things from one another![VAR 0114(0007)]
I think I’ll get myself a treat at the café to\npump myself up before trying the first trial![VAR 0114(0007)]

Greetings.\nCaptain Ilima here.[VAR 0114(000C)]
And my trial...[VAR 0114(000C)]
begins mere steps from here in Verdant Cavern![VAR 0114(000C)]
[~ 3]
Note that the Pokémon living within Verdant\nCavern are quite fierce.\c\nI wouldn’t venture in unless you’ve prepared\nsome Potions and so forth.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Through attempting the trials during the island\nchallenge, one can exceed his or her own limits.\r\n...That is what the Alolan people believe.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Once you enter Verdant Cavern, you will not be\nable to leave until you have completed the trial.\r\nAre you prepared for the trial?[VAR 0114(000C)]
I’ll be waiting for you![VAR 0114(000C)]
Please make your preparations. I’ll be waiting\nfor you![VAR 0114(000C)]

Let me formally welcome you to Verdant Cavern!\nI am your captain, Ilima.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Allow me to explain the basics of my trial.[VAR 0114(000C)]
What you should attempt to do is...[VAR 0114(000C)]
Defeat three of the Pokémon that lurk\nhere in their dens![VAR 0114(000C)]
Then reach the pedestal deep within the cave...\c\nand collect the [VAR COLOR(0001)]Z-Crystal[VAR COLOR(0000)] there![VAR 0114(000C)]
You’ll need to be completely in sync with your\nPokémon to succeed.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Grrrr!
Oh dear!\c\nAnd there’s one more thing I forgot to mention.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Many strong Pokémon make their home in this\ncave, but one stronger and more fearsome\r\nthan all the rest, known as a [VAR COLOR(0001)]Totem Pokémon[VAR COLOR(0000)],\r\nalso resides here!\c\nIt will be the greatest obstacle you face as you\nattempt to clear my trial![VAR 0114(000C)]
By the way, until you clear the trial, you will not \nbe able to catch Pokémon in Verdant Cavern.[VAR 0114(000C)]
This is but one of the seven trials you will face\nduring your island challenge.[VAR 0114(000C)]
And it begins now! The trial of Captain Ilima![VAR 0114(000C)]
Let the Verdant Cavern trial of Ilima...begin!
Not sure what to do?\nIt’s quite simple.\c\nDefeat the three Pokémon, reach the\npedestal at the back of the cave,\r\nand get the Z-Crystal.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Now all you need do is claim the Z-Crystal from\nthe pedestal![VAR 0114(000C)]
Ki-ki-ki-kiii!
The Totem [VAR PKNAME(0002)] is a formidable\nopponent for any Trainer to take on.\c\nIt is a Normal-type Pokémon, so perhaps you\nshould battle back with Fighting-type\r\nPokémon or moves![VAR 0114(000C)]

Looks like there [VAR NUMBRNCH(0000,0302)]isare [VAR NUM1(0000)] more Pokémon for you\nand your team to prove yourself against.
Fantastic!\nYou proved your strength to all three Pokémon!\c\nThen go right ahead inside!
Going somewhere? The goal of the trial is\nto get the Z-Crystal, remember?
It’s pretty tough to even attempt the trial.\nAnd you managed to get a Z-Crystal and finish!\r\nYou’ll be a Trainer to keep an eye on!
Ooh, sorry, but I can’t let you through here till\nyou beat all three Pokémon you were asked to!

Sorry, who are you?
Whoa! Even though we look identical?\nThat’s pretty impressive, actually![VAR 0114(0031)]
Oh, I see...[VAR 0114(0032)]
Just ’cause we switched places, you can’t tell\nwho we are anymore?![VAR 0114(0032)]

What’s up with that?[VAR 0114(0031)]
For real, though?! I can’t get my skull around it!\nThis kid’s mad strong, yo![VAR 0114(0032)]
Naw, it ain’t even like that. This kid is straight\nup dangerous, homie![VAR 0114(0031)]
I don’t know, man...\nIsn’t this whole place trouble?![VAR 0114(0032)]
Yeah! It totally is, homie!\c\nI mean, that thing is so strong that regular\nPokémon don’t even wanna come out and battle![VAR 0114(0031)]
Yo, kid! You know there’s a mad strong\nPokémon lurking back here somewhere, right?\r\nI’d run if I were you.[VAR 0114(0032)]
Naw, we’re not going out like that!\nWe gotta get our revenge!\c\nGo stand over that den and catch that skulking\n[VAR PKNAME(0001)], yo![VAR 0114(0031)]
For real?! Fine!\nI got no bones to pick with you![VAR 0114(0032)]
Yo, you think maybe all these dens are, like,\nconnected or something?\c\nIf they are, and we park our bones right here,\nthen nobody’ll come out these holes, right?[VAR 0114(0032)]
Yo, yo, yo! Come on out!\c\nI’m gonna make you man enough...or, uh,\n’mon enough to take on that big ol’ boss inside![VAR 0114(0031)]

Yes, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]?\c\nWould you like to give up so you can better\nprepare for my trial?\c\nKeep in mind you’ll have to start from the\nbeginning if you give up now, though![VAR 0114(000C)]
I see.\c\nUnfortunately, I’ll have to ask you to go make\nwhatever preparations you may need to\r\nand then come back to try again.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Good!\c\nThen go and defeat the three Pokémon.\c\nOnly then will you be able to claim the Z-Crystal\nwaiting in the final chamber of the cave![VAR 0114(000C)]
Yes, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]? I take it you would like\nto attempt my trial again?[VAR 0114(000C)]
Very well, let the trial begin![VAR 0114(000C)]

What an incredible Trainer you are![VAR 0114(000C)]
For you to be able to defeat the Totem Pokémon\nthat I had trained up to such a powerful state...\r\nI don’t know what I can say![VAR 0114(000C)]
Working in harmony with your Pokémon, you\nhave cleared the trial of Ilima!\r\nYou’re a phenomenal Trainer![VAR 0114(000C)]

You reached out to grab the Z-Crystal from\nthe pedestal!
You obtained a Normal-type Z-Crystal!\nThe Normalium Z is yours!
You placed the Normalium Z in your Bag’s\nZ-Crystals Pocket.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Text File : 101

What you have just received is the Normal\nZ-Crystal![VAR 0114(000C)]
It is known as [VAR COLOR(0001)]Normalium Z![VAR COLOR(0000)][VAR 0114(000C)]
[~ 2]
Now if you let a Pokémon that can use a\nNormal-type move hold that...[VAR 0114(000C)]
and strike an elegant pose like this one...\c\nthen you will be able to strengthen a\nNormal-type move by unleashing Z-Power![VAR 0114(000C)]
Moving right along...[VAR 0114(000C)]
Ah, yes. First, there is one thing I forgot\nto mention.[VAR 0114(000C)]
The Totem Pokémon![VAR 0114(000C)]
In every locale where a captain holds his or\nher trials, you will encounter a particularly\r\nstrong Pokémon, like [VAR PKNAME(0001)] just now.[VAR 0114(000C)]
And during battles against such Pokémon, they\nmay [VAR COLOR(0001)]summon allies [VAR COLOR(0000)]to shore up their offense.\c\nIt’s not a tactic often seen in other regions.\c\nPerhaps Pokémon in Alola are simply more\ninclined to help one another?[VAR 0114(000C)]
Since you have managed to defeat the\nTotem Pokémon and proved yourself, you can\r\nnow try to catch any of the Pokémon you find\r\nhere in this cave.\c\nIn fact, have some Great Balls.[VAR 0114(000C)]
And here, let me see to your Pokémon after all\nof their hard work in there![VAR 0114(000C)]
If we’re done here, I have something interesting\nI’d like to show you. Come with me to Route 3.[VAR 0114(000C)]

Greetings.\nCaptain Ilima here.[VAR 0114(000C)]
As you travel around the islands of Alola, you\nwill find captains’ barricades here and there.[VAR 0114(000C)]
These barricades help mark areas where\nparticularly strong Pokémon can be found.\c\nAnyone can pass through them, of course, if\nthey are escorted by a strong Trainer.\c\nThose attempting the island challenge can pass\nthe barricades, as long as they clear the trials.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Are you ready?\c\nThen behold the power of a captain![VAR 0114(000C)]
Voila!\nYour world just got a little bigger.[VAR 0114(000C)]
I am the only captain here on Melemele Island,\nmeaning my trial is the only one here.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Now that you have cleared the trial, please\ninform our island kahuna, Hala![VAR 0114(000C)]

Hey there, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\c\nOooh, looking at the expression on Ilima’s face,\nI’d say you cleared your first trial, yeah?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Guess I better give you a little reward...\nTime to learn about [VAR COLOR(0001)]Z-Power[VAR COLOR(0000)]. Woo![VAR 0114(0005)]

Phew! Z-Powers heap all of a Trainer’s feelings\nonto a Pokémon, yeah,\r\nwhich totally wears you out!\c\nUsing Z-Power once per battle\nis all a team can handle, yeah.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Oh, so is that why you’ve been looking so\nragged, Professor?[VAR 0114(000C)]
No! It’s like I was hit with Amnesia!\c\nI forgot that I lost Lillie somewhere on Route 3!\c\nThink you could spare some time to help me look\nfor her, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0005)]
I can go and have a look around the cave for\nyou, in case she wandered that way.[VAR 0114(000C)]

Ah...\n[VAR TRNAME(0000)]...[VAR 0114(0006)]
Nebby ran off into the meadow here...[VAR 0114(0006)]
And right after it got into so much trouble\non the bridge, too...\c\nWhat if a wild Pokémon attacks it?\nIt doesn’t have any moves it can use to battle![VAR 0114(0006)]
Here, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].\nLet me heal your Pokémon for you...[VAR 0114(0006)]
I always carry lots of Potions on me to keep\nNebby healthy.\c\nThat’s the best I can do, since I’m not a real\nTrainer or anything...[VAR 0114(0006)]
Pew!
Oh, you![VAR 0114(0006)]
Pew?
Thank you, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].[VAR 0114(0006)]
And I should thank [VAR PKNAME(0001)], too.\nHere, let me at least do this...[VAR 0114(0006)]
You know, I read something interesting in a\nbook once...\c\nIt seems the Pokémon called Oricorio changes\nappearance by feeding on the nectar from\r\ndifferent types of flowers.\c\nIt’s not actually evolving but undergoing a\nso-called “form change.”\c\nIsn’t that interesting? I thought it was, anyway...[VAR 0114(0006)]
Pew!
Back into the bag, please, Nebby.\c\nI know there aren’t many people around to see\nyou here, but that’s hardly an excuse!\c\nAnd I guess we should be going now...\c\nThe professor will probably be worried after\nthe way we just disappeared on him...[VAR 0114(0006)]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Start off by selecting a compatible Z-Crystal\nfrom the Z-Crystals Pocket in your Bag, yeah!
Then use the Z-Crystal you chose\non a Pokémon!
Z-Crystals are [VAR COLOR(0001)]compatible [VAR COLOR(0000)]with a Pokémon if it\nknows a move of the same type as the crystal.
Have your Pokémon hold Z-Crystals, and you’ll\nbe able to use Z-Power in battles!
And don’t worry, you can use your Z-Crystals\nover and over on as many Pokémon as you want!

Hey, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\c\nI wanna see if I really learned anything from my\ntrial. Let me battle you again![VAR 0114(0007)]
So you and me both beat that Totem Pokémon,\nhuh, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]?\c\nLooks like we’re getting pretty strong!\c\nBut I wonder if I’ll ever really be able to beat my\ngramps at this rate...[VAR 0114(0007)]
Hey there, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\nKnew I could count on you, yeah!\c\nThanks for tracking Lillie down for me![VAR 0114(0005)]

Heh heh, right...[VAR 0114(0007)]
Hala’s probably rubbing his hands together in\nglee right about now, oh yeah![VAR 0114(0005)]
What do you mean?[VAR 0114(0006)]
It’s all a part of the trials, yeah?\c\nAfter you clear one island’s trials, you gotta\nbattle that island’s kahuna![VAR 0114(0007)]
Taking on the island kahuna in battle is called\nthe [VAR COLOR(0001)]grand trial[VAR COLOR(0000)]!\c\nFor someone like me who’s researching Pokémon\nmoves, nothing could be better than the chance\r\nto see some more fierce Pokémon battles! Woo![VAR 0114(0005)]
I don’t know about fierce...[VAR 0114(0007)]
I’ll be the judge of that!\nCome on! Back to Iki Town!\c\nCatch that Tailwind and blast through Route 3![VAR 0114(0005)]

It’s true... I’m not a Trainer, so I’m sure I don’t\nreally understand how hard it must have been...\r\nbut even I think it’s a great achievement.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Pew!
Yes, yes... We all know how you feel!\nBut stay inside your bag, please![VAR 0114(0006)]
The Melemele kahuna is strong, cousin!\c\nHe’s a Trainer who can use [VAR COLOR(0001)]Fighting-type[VAR COLOR(0000)]\nPokémon to the fullest, yeah.\c\nMight not be a bad idea to work on those\nFlying- or Psychic-type moves![VAR 0114(0005)]

Shall we begin?\c\nThe final trial here on Melemele Island will be a\nPokémon battle against me, the kahuna!\c\nIt is known as the grand trial![VAR 0114(0008)]
Your spirit appears to be ready! However, your\nPokémon must also be healthy if they are to\r\nunleash their full power in battle![VAR 0114(0008)]
Yes! It seems that both you and your Pokémon\nare prepared to combine your mental and\r\nphysical strengths to unleash your full power![VAR 0114(0008)]
Well, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\c\nYou have been entrusted with the\nSparkling Stone by Tapu Koko!\c\nNow show me you and your partner\n[VAR PKNAME(0001)]’s full power![VAR 0114(0008)]

The results come as no surprise to me.\c\nWhat a fine Trainer...and what fine Pokémon, too![VAR 0114(0008)]
Tapu Ko-ko-ko!
Ho! And our mighty Tapu Koko agrees![VAR 0114(0008)]
Hmmph! Perhaps Tapu Koko is hoping that a\nday may come when you will grow strong\r\nenough to battle it as well...[VAR 0114(0008)]
Accept this Z-Crystal! It allows Trainers to\nshare their power with their partner Pokémon![VAR 0114(0008)]
Observe, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].\c\nIf you wish to use the Fighting-type Z-Power,\nmove your arm like this...\r\nthen bend your hips like this and pose![VAR 0114(0008)]
Now then, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\nWith this victory...\c\nyou have cleared all of the trials of Melemele\nIsland, the first of Alola’s islands!\c\nThe Melemele stamp is proof of\nyour accomplishments. With it, Pokémon up to\r\nLv. 35, even those you received in a trade,\r\nwill obey you![VAR 0114(0008)]
The moon in the daytime...\nThe sun at night...\c\nNow to see if you can pour your heart into\nsomething that cannot be seen but is very\r\nmuch real.\c\nAs you continue on your island challenge,\nconsider what makes up the people and\r\nPokémon that you meet: both what you\r\ncan see and what you cannot.\c\nYou will surely meet Tapu Koko again someday.[VAR 0114(0008)]

See, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].\c\nHere in Alola our Pokémon lend us their strength\nand let us ride about on them![VAR 0114(0008)]
Let me explain some of the gear I gave you...\c\nYour Ride Pager is a tool that lets you summon\na Ride Pokémon.\c\nAccording to the instructions, you need only \n“press the [VAR COLOR(0001)]Y Button[VAR COLOR(0000)] to turn on your\r\nRide Pager! Use the B Button to dash!”[VAR 0114(0008)]
And your Riding Wear will be the special outfit\nyou wear when riding Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Have a little romp around Alola with Tauros\nhere. I’m sure you’ll be charmed by him![VAR 0114(0008)]
When you use your Ride Pager, Ride Pokémon\nwill kindly come running to help you wherever\r\nyou may be![VAR 0114(0008)]

Congratulations, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].\c\nI hope you find your Ride Pager useful. I worked\non developing it with a friend of mine.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Aren’t Z-Powers lovely?[VAR 0114(000C)]
I’m amazed that you won without\neven using your Z-Power.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Let’s have a Pokémon battle when next\nwe meet![VAR 0114(000C)]
Very well then, off on your island challenge you\ngo! May the future bring you happiness![VAR 0114(000C)]

All right, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].\c\nWith a little help from Tauros, you can smash\nright through those big rocks on Route 1![VAR 0114(0008)]
[~ 1]
All right! I got a little something for you, too![VAR 0114(0005)]
False Swipe is a move that will leave your\nopponent with 1 HP when you attack.\c\nKeep on catching more and more Pokémon,\nyeah, and tell Rotom all about it![VAR 0114(0005)]
But first, you’ve gotta go let your mom know\nwhat you’re up to.\c\nWhen you’re done with that, head on down to\nthe Marina in Hau’oli City. Oh yeah![VAR 0114(0005)]
All right, time to get the boat ready.\nLillie, you gonna help me clean it?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Um...\c\nI actually wanted to ask a favor of you first,\n[VAR TRNAME(0000)]. If that’s all right?[VAR 0114(0006)]
Sure!
What is it?
You see...\nNebby is...\c\nIts real home is far away from here.\nAnd I want to help it get home.[VAR 0114(0006)]
It’s like I told you before...\nNebby saved my life once when I was in trouble.\c\nNow I want to save it![VAR 0114(0006)]
I feel like there’s not much I can do on my own,\nsince I’m not a Pokémon Trainer...\c\nBut if I had a real Trainer like you helping me,\n[VAR TRNAME(0000)], then maybe...[VAR 0114(0006)]
But I probably shouldn’t ask a near stranger to\nhelp, right?\c\nI know it’s just my own wish and it has nothing\nto do with you...[VAR 0114(0006)]
Of course I’ll help!
Yeah, I don’t know...
Oh, thank you so much. I’m so glad!\nI really didn’t know what else to do![VAR 0114(0006)]
Then I suppose...\c\nThe two of us will be heading to the next island\nas well![VAR 0114(0006)]
Pew!
I...I understand.\c\nUm, but if you ever do learn anything that you\nthink might help Nebby get home...\r\nI’d really appreciate it if you could tell me.\c\nI’ll do my best to look for clues on the next\nisland on my own.\c\nAnd maybe I’ll see you there.[VAR 0114(0006)]

What about you, Professor?[VAR 0114(0007)]
The land is certainly ahoy, oh boy![VAR 0114(0005)]

I was on my way to see who was pulling into\nport and ran into Mallow here while she was\r\nout on a delivery.[VAR 0114(0009)]
Yup! My trial will be a chance for all the fine\ningredients that make up your team to shine![VAR 0114(000E)]
Especially you two!\nYour Pokémon look ready to cook with gas![VAR 0114(000E)]
And Mallow isn’t the only captain here on \nAkala Island, of course.[VAR 0114(0009)]
So? What’s the plan, kids?[VAR 0114(0009)]
Yeah, that’s up to these kids.\nIt’s their island challenge, after all![VAR 0114(0005)]
Yes...I suppose so.[VAR 0114(0009)]
OK, then.\c\nEnjoy your time on your island challenge, kids,\nalong with your Pokémon.\c\nI’ll be waiting for my chance to face you\nin battle when the time comes.[VAR 0114(0009)]
I’m looking forward to seeing what you’ve got![VAR 0114(0009)]
Let’s go, Mallow.[VAR 0114(0009)]
I’m sure she wanted to come see that you made\nit here all right...\c\nBut she’ll never admit it to you! Hah!\c\nThat’s Olivia for you.\nShe’s a kind [VAR COLOR(0001)]kahuna[VAR COLOR(0000)], deep down.[VAR 0114(0005)]
There are [VAR COLOR(0001)]three trials[VAR COLOR(0000)] here on Akala Island.\c\nIf you two decide you want to take on the trial\nstraightaway, head up Route 4 there and keep\r\non goin’ until you get to Paniola Town.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Shoots, I know where I’m going first,\nand that is straight to the Pokémon Center![VAR 0114(0007)]
I wonder what kind of malasada they make\non Akala, eh?[VAR 0114(0007)]
Maybe I’ll see about some shopping of my own...\c\nAnd I should find out about the ruins for\nNebby’s sake, too...[VAR 0114(0006)]
You’ve made it to Akala, [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0B07)]big boyclever girl!\nThis means a whole new [VAR COLOR(0001)]Island Pokédex[VAR COLOR(0000)], zzt!\c\nI’ll try to keep you up to date on all the new\nPokémon you uncover, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]! Zzzzzt![VAR 0114(0035)]

You looking for the ruins?

Yes, this little fellow will hardly sit still...\c\nI think Nebby might be interested in visiting\nthe Ruins of Life.\c\nApparently they house the sacred guardian of\nAkala Island. A creature called Tapu Lele.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Well, yes, I was doing that, too.\nBut this little fellow will hardly sit still...\c\nI think Nebby might be interested in visiting\nthe Ruins of Life.\c\nApparently they house the sacred guardian of\nAkala Island. A creature called Tapu Lele.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Pew?
I wondered if you’d like to come with us when\nwe go to visit the ruins...\c\nI mean...little Nebby here seems to like you quite\na bit, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]...[VAR 0114(0006)]
I’ll be at Tide Song Hotel if you decide you want\nto come.\c\nI’m supposed to be meeting someone there...\nSomeone very important to me...[VAR 0114(0006)]
I’ll be all right.\nI can see the building from here, after all.\r\nEven I shouldn’t be able to lose my way. I think.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Pew!
And you! I’ll have you stay in your bag, mister.[VAR 0114(0006)]
I’ve heard that there is a group of terrible\npeople around who try to steal Pokémon.\r\nA group called Team Skull.\c\nWe need to be careful if we want to escape the\nnotice of such a collection of villains...\c\nIsn’t that right, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0006)]
I wonder if the guardian of Akala will also be\ninterested in you, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]...\r\nYou are the one who got that sparkling stone.[VAR 0114(0006)]

My name’s Sina!\nA beautiful name for a beautiful lady![VAR 0114(0026)]
We’re here seeing the sights in Alola.\c\nIts unique tradition of island challenge...\nIt’s pretty fascinating, I’ve got to say.[VAR 0114(0027)]
Oh, I’ve got an idea!\nYou and Dexio should battle![VAR 0114(0026)]
And why should we do that?\c\nThough I might as well test my skills.\c\nIs that all right with you?[VAR 0114(0027)]
Then I’ll let my partners go wild![VAR 0114(0027)]
If you’d ever like to battle, I’d be willing.\nJust ask.[VAR 0114(0027)]
Oh, I’ve got an idea!\nWhy don’t you test your skills with me?[VAR 0114(0026)]
OK! Let’s get this show on the road![VAR 0114(0026)]
OK, I’ll wait till you’re up to the challenge of my\nawesome team![VAR 0114(0026)]
That’s what I would expect from a Trainer\ndoing the island challenge.\c\nI felt the bond between you and your Pokémon![VAR 0114(0027)]
I get it... Facing trials helps you grow close to\nyour team.\c\nI think that’s absolutely wonderful![VAR 0114(0026)]
I feel like I’ve been able to have a glimpse of\nthe island challenge!\c\nLet me heal your Pokémon as thanks![VAR 0114(0026)]
You and your Pokémon are the ultimate team!\nNo doubt about it!\c\nThis battle reminded me of us in the past...and\nthat group of five young Trainers.\c\nI’ve made up my mind! I’ll entrust this important\nitem to you![VAR 0114(0027)]
The item that I just gave you is for collecting\nthe Cores and Cells of a Pokémon—Zygarde.\c\nI’ll tell you the details another time, so please\nkeep it safe for now.\c\nFor your island challenge, it might not be a bad\nidea to go to Route 4 to train your Pokémon.\c\nWe’ll be taking our leave now!\nBon voyage![VAR 0114(0026)]

Having a battle in a place like Paniola Town\nfeels like we’re in a real old-fashioned Western\r\nshowdown or something, right?\r\nThis is so cool!\c\nThough if we’re real honorable cowboys, we’ve\ngotta make sure our teams are healthy first.[VAR 0114(0007)]

Ma-a-an, that was some kinda battle!\c\nOur Pokémon all look like they had a blast, too![VAR 0114(0007)]
Right then. Here. I’ll share my bit of good luck\nwith you, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].[VAR 0114(0007)]
You know how the Totem Pokémon are all, like,\nsurrounded by some aura of power?\c\nIf you use a Dire Hit on your Pokémon and\nmanage to land a critical hit, that aura won’t\r\nmean a thing![VAR 0114(0007)]
You know, Pokémon battles are just, like,\nsometimes you win, sometimes you lose.\c\nBut you’re only really a loser if you don’t have\nany fun while you’re at it. Right?\c\nAnyway, I’m heading off to Paniola Ranch![VAR 0114(0007)]

Hmm. So you have enough sense to be wary.\nNot bad...[VAR 0114(0030)]
I’m Gladion.\c\nI battle for my partner, Null, to make it strong.\c\nThough most of our time gets used up doing\nsmall jobs for Team Skull.[VAR 0114(0013)]

That kid there.\nHis Pokémon aren’t weak.[VAR 0114(0013)]
And sure, it’s fine to enjoy battling...[VAR 0114(0013)]
But this brat...\c\nhe’s just using that as an excuse not to try\nhard because he can’t beat the kahuna.\r\nBecause he can’t beat Hala when he’s serious![VAR 0114(0013)]
You know my gramps?\nWait. So you think I’m strong?[VAR 0114(0007)]
Awww, look at you, little Gladion!\nAren’t you just a real cool guy? Heh heh heh...[VAR 0114(0031)]
I guess it’s no surprise a homeless kid would\nturn out spineless, too, huh?\c\nNo worries! We’ve got enough backbone to\ncover for you![VAR 0114(0032)]
Just give it up already.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Huh?[VAR 0114(0031)]
You know you can’t beat me.\nYou’ll just get your Pokémon hurt for no reason.[VAR 0114(0013)]
They’re good Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0013)]
We came all this way, and for what?\nFor a big fat waste of our time, thanks to you.\c\nIf you hadn’t gotten in our way, we could’ve\nstolen the Totem Pokémon from Brooklet Hill![VAR 0114(0032)]
Let’s get out of here. Look, the Murkrow are\ncrying, and it’s time we should be flying.[VAR 0114(0032)]
Listen up good, Gladion...\nThe boss does like you. That’s true.\c\nBut you’re just some hired help we keep around\nfor when we need you.\c\nYou aren’t part of Team Skull, not really.\nAnd you never will be. Got it? You better get it.[VAR 0114(0031)]
Thanks, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].\nAnd [VAR PKNAME(0001)], too.\r\nIt was a good battle![VAR 0114(0007)]

What is it, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]?\c\nDo you need to leave so that you might prepare\nyourself better for my trial?[VAR 0114(000D)]
I understand.\c\nIt’s unfortunate, of course, but go prepare\nyourself so you can come try again.[VAR 0114(000D)]

Very well done, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\nPlease come back this way.[VAR 0114(000D)]
I...I must say that I find myself at an\nimpasse here.\c\nAll of the Wishiwashi that I so diligently trained\nup were defeated, and that is very frustrating...\c\nbut of course I cannot let your completion of my\ntrial go uncelebrated, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].[VAR 0114(000D)]
You were amazing, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].\nTruly impressive.\c\nPlease take this.[VAR 0114(000D)]
You do know what this is, don’t you?\c\nWatch. This is how you use Waterium Z.[VAR 0114(000D)]
And that’s not all I can offer you.\c\nHere. This is a Lana original.\nOne of my own handmade fishing rods.[VAR 0114(000D)]
This is how you use my fishing rod:\c\nWhen you want to fish for Pokémon, look for\npiles of rocks in the water.\r\nFish like to hide in the shadows there.\c\nWhen you see your bob dip under the water,\nyou have a bite. But you won’t for long.\c\nThe Pokémon will struggle to get away, so\npress  as soon as you see the “!” mark.[VAR 0114(000D)]
If you want to catch any of the Pokémon you\nfish up for your team, I recommend Dive Balls.[VAR 0114(000D)]
By the way...\c\nDid you know I once reeled in a red Gyarados?[VAR 0114(000D)]
You did?!
Did you really?
Well, what do you think?[VAR 0114(000D)]
You did a fine job today.\c\nShall I see you back to the Pokémon Center on\nRoute 5?[VAR 0114(000D)]
Good. Let’s be going then.\nAnd you can always do a spot of fishing later.[VAR 0114(000D)]
I understand. Oh yes, I understand all too well.\c\nThe siren call of the sea...\nand the urge to fish up something wonderful![VAR 0114(000D)]

Oh. And that reminds me...\nDid you see any Sudowoodo by Paniola Ranch?\c\nThey were causing some trouble for people, so I\ngave them a little dose of Z-Power using my\r\nWaterium Z. Just a little lesson for them.\c\nI wonder how they will react now that they see\nthat you have Waterium Z, too?\c\nHeh.[VAR 0114(000D)]

These scoundrels are Pokémon thieves.\nAnd you’re on familiar terms with them?[VAR 0114(0030)]
Well, yeah, I know them
I don’t know who they are!
Yeah, that’s right, you do![VAR 0114(0031)]
Yo, for real?![VAR 0114(0031)]

Life in the big city sure is something else.\c\nPokémon thieves roam about brazenly...[VAR 0114(000B)]
Hmm, I leave that one to you.[VAR 0114(000B)]
We’re not thieves, yo!\nIt’s a legitimate business![VAR 0114(0031)]
We got straight messed up in Melemele...\ngot exiled to Akala...\c\nbut we ain’t goin’ out like that![VAR 0114(0032)]
With all these losses,\nwe’re gonna anger our bosses!\c\nThese tears taste like salt, yo!\nIt’s all your fault, yo![VAR 0114(0032)]
Floooon?
Ne-hiiiiii!
Mudsdale, shall we stomp these scoundrels?\c\nIt’ll be a mess to clean up afterward, but\nI am willing if you are.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Time for us to break out, yo!\nGotta tell y’all peace out, yo![VAR 0114(0032)]
I’m not gonna keep telling you this...\nexcept when I keep telling you this!\c\nYou better listen to what my homie says\nand drill it into that thick skull of yours!\r\nSeriously! You’d better not forget, numskull![VAR 0114(0031)]
You’ll be fine getting home?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Floo-oooon...
Glad to see that one will get home on her own.[VAR 0114(000B)]
I’ve got you to thank for that.\nGive me your name, Trainer.[VAR 0114(000B)]
[VAR TRNAME(0000)], eh?\nThat’s a fine name.\c\nI like the way you handled yourself in battle.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Mudsdale and I are always wandering all\nabout Alola to try to achieve our goals, so\r\nperhaps we’ll meet again someday.\r\nI am indebted to you for your aid, after all.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Ni-hiii!
Ah yes.\c\nYou might want to try your hand at a \n[VAR COLOR(0001)]Battle Royal [VAR COLOR(0000)]or two, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].\c\nMudsdale here thinks you’d be well suited to it,\ngiven how strong you are.[VAR 0114(000B)]

Four Trainers![VAR 0114(002E)]
Four Trainers, yeah, each pick three Pokémon,\nyeah, for one big Pokémon battle, oh yeah![VAR 0114(002E)]
When one Trainer’s team can’t battle anymore,\nyeah, the Battle Royal ends!\c\nWhichever Trainer has taken out the most\nPokémon, yeah, and has the most Pokémon left\r\nwill emerge the winner. Woo![VAR 0114(002E)]

Ah, the breath of the jungle...\c\nI can tell just what today’s special should be...[VAR 0114(000E)]
Yup! It’s gotta be!\c\nMy personal specialty: the Mallow Special![VAR 0114(000E)]
I’m gonna need you to find four ingredients\nfor me!\c\nI’ll need a Mago Berry, a Tiny Mushroom,\na Revival Herb, and a Miracle Seed![VAR 0114(000E)]
Here you go! I brought you a Forage Bag to hold\nall the ingredients gathered for your trial.[VAR 0114(000E)]
If you put the trial ingredients in your own bag,\nthey’d get mixed up with your stuff, right?[VAR 0114(000E)]
When you’re hunting for ingredients, you’re\ngonna want to rely on Stoutland’s help.\r\nIt’ll find things that you don’t see, after all.\c\nYou remember what I told you at the farm,\nright? Just press the B Button to use\r\nStoutland Search![VAR 0114(000E)]

Tiny Mushrooms
Big Mushrooms
You put a Tiny Mushroom in your Forage Bag!
You tried putting the Big Mushroom in your\nForage Bag...
But the Big Mushroom attacked!
Hey, it’s me, Mallow!\nOoh, a Tiny Mushroom! That’s great![VAR 0114(000E)]
There’s a secret to why they’re so popular with\nsome people. You’ll have to try one to find out\r\nwhat it is![VAR 0114(000E)]
Ooh, looks like you got everything!\c\nOK, it’s time for us to start cooking, so come on\nback to the entrance of the jungle![VAR 0114(000E)]

It’s a Revival Herb!\c\nYou put the Revival Herb in your Forage Bag!
It’s a Revival Herb!\c\nWait... No, it’s not!\nOn second glance, it’s just a normal weed!
A Pokémon leaped out of the grass to attack!
Hey, it’s me, Mallow!\nThat’s a fine Revival Herb![VAR 0114(000E)]
Its bitter bite is even a shock to Pokémon,\nbut that’s what will add depth to the flavor![VAR 0114(000E)]

Yes, even back at Wela Volcano Park my\nvaunted Salazzle didn’t stand a chance.[VAR 0114(000F)]
Nor did the Wishiwashi that I had trained\nso carefully...[VAR 0114(000D)]
All right, you’ve cleared all three of\nAkala’s trials!\c\nYou even managed to get through my\ntrial, and I’d say it’s a real doozy!\r\nHere! A gift for such an inspiring young Trainer![VAR 0114(000E)]
You received a Z-Crystal from Mallow!
You obtained a Grass-type Z-Crystal!\nThe Grassium Z is yours![VAR 0114(000E)]
Let me show you how to use Grass-type\nZ-Moves! You go like “Graaassss,” ’K?[VAR 0114(000E)]
Since you’ve cleared my trial, [VAR TRNAME(0000)],\nI want you to help me train some Pokémon from\r\nhere in Lush Jungle.\c\nHere, have some Nest Balls![VAR 0114(000E)]
Hm?\nLooks like Lurantis didn’t finish all the food.\c\nOooh, I really want you guys to try some!\nHave a bite, Kiawe! You, too, Lana![VAR 0114(000E)]
If you insist.[VAR 0114(000F)]

Uhhn![VAR 0114(000F)]

Lush Jungle has some tough Pokémon, it’s true.\c\nRemember that Fire- and Flying-type moves are\nsuper effective against Bug and Grass types.\c\nNow get back in there and do your best![VAR 0114(000E)]

I am Kiawe.[VAR 0114(000F)]
My Marowak and I are students of the ancient\ndances that have been passed down in Alola\r\nfor generations.[VAR 0114(000F)]
The trial of Kiawe...\c\nYou will find that it is a bit different than the\ntrials you have faced to this point, but of\r\ncourse, you will attempt it, right?[VAR 0114(000F)]
Of course!
Not right now
Well, [VAR TRNAME(0000)], it looks like you have\nfailed my trial.[VAR 0114(000F)]
In my trial several Pokémon will appear, and you\nwill indeed battle them.\c\nBy carefully observing their dance, you can\navoid unnecessary battles. Never forget that\r\nthis is one way to approach the trial.[VAR 0114(000F)]
The Totem Pokémon Salazzle is a Poison and\nFire type, so she is weak to Water-type moves.\c\nShe also uses Torment to prevent your Pokémon\nfrom using the same move twice in a row.\c\nGood luck. I’m counting on you.[VAR 0114(000F)]

My trial will test your powers of observation!\nThere will be a dance...and then another.\c\nYour task will be to find the difference between\nthe two.\c\nBegin![VAR 0114(000F)]
Watch carefully and memorize this dance.[VAR 0114(000F)]
What was different from the previous dance?[VAR 0114(000F)]
The right Marowak
The middle Marowak
The left Marowak
Show me again!

Whoa!\c\nS-spectacular!\c\nWith your keen observations, you were able to\nsee even fine differences in our dances!\c\nAnd you defeated the Totem Pokémon with\nsuch ease![VAR 0114(000F)]
The Totem Pokémon was carrying a Firium Z.\nIt is yours now.[VAR 0114(000F)]
This is how you use the Fire-type Z-Power![VAR 0114(000F)]

You there![VAR 0114(0030)]
Oh, excuse me! I am a scientist.\nMy name is Colress.\c\nThe theme of my research is:\n“Bringing out the potential of Pokémon.”\c\nWhat brings out the power of Pokémon is...[VAR 0114(002B)]
I believe that is—the bond they share with\ntheir Trainers![VAR 0114(002B)]
And thus my attention is drawn to Trainers\nlike yourself...\c\nTrainers bound to their Pokémon through the\npower of the Z-Ring![VAR 0114(002B)]

Olivia is an expert user of Rock-type Pokémon.\nYou’re gonna wanna catch some Grass-type\r\nPokémon in Lush Jungle to add to your team.[VAR 0114(0005)]

Heh...\nI was just acting like I was [VAR TRNAME(0000)].[VAR 0114(0006)]
You...you always seemed to end up getting hurt,\nNebby.\c\nSo I never really liked Pokémon Trainers or\nthought that I would want to be one myself.\c\nBut when I see [VAR TRNAME(0000)] and Hau...\c\nIt’s like they’ve thrown open some door that I\nalways thought was closed...\r\nThey stride straight through it into the future...\r\nIt seems...so amazing somehow...[VAR 0114(0006)]
Pew?
Oh![VAR 0114(0006)]
Um, oh, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]. Hello.\nI feel like it’s been a while since we last met.\c\nTh-there’s a laboratory here that studies the\ndimensions, did you know?\c\nAnd the professor is waiting to meet you![VAR 0114(0006)]
How...how were your trials?\nIt must be quite trying to do three in a row.[VAR 0114(0006)]
It was no problem
It was really tough
Goodness, really? It wasn’t any trouble for you\nto tackle all three of Akala Island’s trials?\c\nI suppose that explains it.\c\nThe reason you look so content and understood\nby [VAR PKNAME(0001)] there, I mean.[VAR 0114(0006)]
I would think so...\nBut still! You made it through all three!\c\nI think that explains it.\c\nThe reason you look so content and understood\nby [VAR PKNAME(0001)] there, I mean.[VAR 0114(0006)]

Hey there, honey![VAR 0114(0005)]
Oh, hi![VAR 0114(0030)]
This here’s Professor Burnet.\c\nShe runs the Dimensional Research Lab, yeah...\c\nAnd she’s also my wife![VAR 0114(0005)]
You’re [VAR TRNAME(0000)], right?\nLillie told me about you.\c\nShe said you were the reliable sort.[VAR 0114(001B)]
Three months ago...\c\nI found Lillie lying on a beach.\c\nCosmog in her bag also unconscious.[VAR 0114(001B)]
Hm?\nNo Hau today?[VAR 0114(001B)]
Hau? He’s out doing his own thing.\c\nBut he’ll be the real deal someday... He could\neven become a kahuna, just like old Hala\r\nbefore him![VAR 0114(0005)]
You really think so?![VAR 0114(0007)]
Whoa-ho!\c\nWell, yeah, I really do.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Good to see you again, Hau!\nIt’s been a while since I last saw you.[VAR 0114(001B)]
Anyhow, I brought [VAR TRNAME(0000)] here\nbecause I wanted you to tell h[VAR GENDBR(0000,0202)]imer about some of\r\nthe mysterious phenomena here in Alola.[VAR 0114(0005)]
I’d be happy to!\c\nThe mysteries of Alola, huh?\nThen you’ve got to mean...[VAR 0114(001B)]
the [VAR COLOR(0001)]Ultra Wormhole[VAR COLOR(0000)]![VAR 0114(001B)]
It’s extremely rare, but sometimes a hole opens\nin the sky over Alola.\c\nIt appears that this rift leads to a different\nand unknown dimension.[VAR 0114(001B)]
The reason that people think there may be a\nmysterious dimension is because of the legends\r\nof fearsome Pokémon appearing from the Ultra\r\nWormhole.[VAR 0114(001B)]
Pew...
It’s very weak as proof, but I can’t ignore it.\c\nThere is also plenty of evidence already in the\nPokédex for the existence of different\r\ndimensions, right?[VAR 0114(001B)]
Fearsome Pokémon...?[VAR 0114(0007)]
Even normal wild Pokémon sometimes attack\npeople, right?\c\nBut the Pokémon that appeared from the Ultra\nWormhole went way beyond that.[VAR 0114(001B)]
They were called Ultra Beasts...\nAnd they were feared.\c\nIf the stories are to be believed, the guardian\ndeities of the islands fought desperately\r\nagainst them.[VAR 0114(001B)]
But like I said, it’s all legends and folktales.\nIt’s hard to know how much is true.[VAR 0114(001B)]
But I would be very happy if I could somehow\nunravel the mysteries of the Ultra Wormhole by\r\nstudying the dimensional disturbances![VAR 0114(001B)]
We’ve recorded several known relationships\nbetween Pokémon and different dimensions\r\nin books. You can find them on the bookshelf\r\nin this lab.[VAR 0114(001B)]

You want to know what happened three\nmonths ago?\c\nWell, I’d wanted to learn more about Nebby...\c\nI mean, about Cosmog.\c\nSo I decided to come speak to Professor Burnet.\c\nBut I got lost along the way...and ended up\nwandering about until I collapsed on the shore...[VAR 0114(0006)]
She listened to my story, staying up all night to\nhear it all. And then she even got her husband,\r\nProfessor Kukui, to lend me his loft to stay in...\c\nAnd she told him to help me investigate\nNebby’s origins, too.\c\nProfessor Burnet has been so kind, and she’s\nstill helping me try to find a way to get Nebby\r\nback to its own home...[VAR 0114(0006)]
She’s been like...like a real mother to me.[VAR 0114(0006)]

You’ve finished all three of Akala’s trials. Woo!\nAnd now comes the big match against Olivia—\r\nthe island kahuna!\c\nIt’s the biggest and baddest trial of them all\nhere on Akala—the grand trial![VAR 0114(0005)]
Good luck!\c\nOlivia’s house is past Diglett’s Tunnel.\nIt’s in Konikoni City!\c\nBut watch out for Team Skull![VAR 0114(001B)]
I still have some things I want to talk to\nProfessor Burnet about, so I’ll stay here.[VAR 0114(0006)]

This cave really is something, y’know?\c\nIt’s overflowing with these Pokémon called \nDiglett, and they are getting really out of hand.\r\nMediocre Trainers can’t even get through![VAR 0114(0009)]
So, how’s your island challenge going?\nLet me see which crystals you’ve earned.[VAR 0114(0009)]
Couldn’t wait to come see me, hmm?\c\nBut tackle Brooklet Hill first.\nIt’s right past Paniola Town.[VAR 0114(0009)]
OK, you’re doing all right! How’s that Waterium Z\nworking out for you?\c\nJudging by how well you and your team get\nalong, I bet you guys can do some real damage\r\nwith it!\c\nOK, [VAR TRNAME(0000)], Kiawe’s trial is next!\nOff to Wela Volcano Park you go![VAR 0114(0009)]
It looks like you’ve tackled everything but\nAkala Island’s last trial in Lush Jungle!\c\nJust relax and have fun with it. Your Pokémon\nwill be happier that way, too.[VAR 0114(0009)]
Oh hey, since you’re here on Akala...\c\nHave you made it out to our Dimensional\nResearch Lab yet?\c\nTraveling about for your island challenge is\nabout more than just trials, you know.\r\nHave a look around while you’re at it.[VAR 0114(0009)]
Ooh, look at you, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]! Nice work!\nI see you’ve even passed Mallow’s trial.\c\nIt’s about time you had some fun with me!\nThe Diglett have settled down, too.\c\nIf you are as strong as you appear, you should\nbe able to make it through this cave.[VAR 0114(0009)]

Phew...\c\nWith Olivia in charge, we’ve finally managed to\nmake some headway against those Diglett.
Oh! Alola!\c\nWe’re members of the Aether Foundation.\nWe work to support Pokémon conservation.
It seems like Team Skull was responsible for\nthe Diglett in this cave getting so riled up and\r\nbringing them all up to the surface.
Oh, Team Skull is this group of troublemakers,\nyou see...\c\nThey seem to delight in interfering with Trainers\nand their Pokémon.
Diglett normally live in elaborate systems of\nunderground tunnels that take years to dig out.\c\nWe’re here to ensure that they return to their\ntunnels and let people pass through here\r\nwithout having to fight so many Pokémon.
Some of the Diglett are still stuck on or near the\nsurface, though, so be careful!

Ahh, no way...\c\nJust when things were startin’ to heat up, yo,\nI got surrounded by Diglett and beat up, yo!\c\nYo, since when can Diglett use Beat Up?![VAR 0114(0031)]
I’m so mad that now I want to beat up on\nsome fools.\c\nDon’t be mad ’cause you were the fool who was\ndumb enough to be here right now.[VAR 0114(0031)]

You certainly don’t see Pokémon like that\nevery day.\c\nTapu Lele may be called the guardian deity of\nour island, but it can also run wild at times.\c\nRegular Pokémon normally avoid the guardians\nat all costs...\c\nUnless they are strong enough to face the\ntapu themselves, that is.[VAR 0114(0009)]
Wait, that can’t be right...[VAR 0114(0009)]
I think your journey will hold many surprises.\nAnd I hope it holds many joys.[VAR 0114(0009)]
I’ll take you back to town, Lillie.\c\nYou’re doing everything you can for your\npartner, even though you’re not a Trainer.\c\nI like that kind of person, so I can’t help but\ngive you a hand![VAR 0114(0009)]

Ooh, the Aether Foundation?\c\nI’m not sure what he wants with you,\n[VAR TRNAME(0000)], but why not go find out?\c\nIf you don’t want to keep him waiting, then\nCharizard should get you there in no time.\c\nThe Hano Grand Resort lies just over the bridge\nnear the Dimensional Research Lab.[VAR 0114(0009)]

Let me tell you about Aether Paradise.\c\nJust as the name suggests, Aether Paradise is a\nveritable paradise for Pokémon that floats far\r\nout in the sea surrounding Alola.\c\nIt is an artificial island, made entirely by human\ntechnology, for the protecting of Pokémon!\c\nOf course I’m an adult who keeps his promises.\nSo I will prove to you that all I’ve told you is the\r\nabsolute truth with a tour of Aether Paradise.\c\nYou will come, won’t you?![VAR 0114(0015)]
Good, good. Then you’ll come with me.\nAether Paradise will amaze you.[VAR 0114(0015)]
Hmm. Yes.\c\nWell, children are often too frivolous and\naimless to properly think through—\r\nAhem. I mean they value their freedom so.\c\nBut the answer that I want to hear from you is\na resounding “Yes!” Now let’s hear it![VAR 0114(0015)]
Wait!\nTake me, too![VAR 0114(0007)]
Oh?\nEven Kahuna Olivia has come to see you off?[VAR 0114(0015)]
As a kahuna, I look after all the trial-goers who\ncome to my island. They’re like my own children.\c\nNot that I’ve got any—I’ve never even\ngotten married.[VAR 0114(0009)]
Listen up, you two.\c\nYour greatest opponent is always yourself.\nYour greatest allies, the Pokémon beside you.[VAR 0114(0009)]
Thanks!\c\nAre you coming, too, Professor?[VAR 0114(0007)]
I’ve got my own business to attend to.\c\nYou go see all the amazing tech that Aether’s\ndeveloping and tell me about it later, yeah?[VAR 0114(0005)]
That’s right. I’ll see you on the next island...\c\nUla’ula Island, yeah?\nThen let’s meet up at Malie Garden![VAR 0114(0005)]
Yup! It’s good-bye, Akala Island!\c\nThough I guess we can come back anytime\nwe want to, huh?[VAR 0114(0007)]

Aether Paradise is a safe haven for all Pokémon.\c\nFor this reason, the use of Poké Balls is strictly\nforbidden within the conservation area.
Wow![VAR 0114(0007)]
We keep Pokémon that have been targeted by\nTeam Skull here...[VAR 0114(0016)]
And we also try to support Pokémon that need\na little extra protection.\c\nLike Corsola, for example. They are quite terribly\noverhunted by a Pokémon called Toxapex.[VAR 0114(0016)]
I hope you don’t mind if I read a passage from\nmy Pokédex.[VAR 0114(0016)]
“Toxapex...\c\n“Toxapex crawls along the ocean floor on its\n12 legs. It leaves a trail of Corsola bits\r\nscattered in its wake.”[VAR 0114(0016)]
Yeah. My gramps is always saying that nature’s\ngot its cruel side, sure as it gives us blessings.[VAR 0114(0007)]
But can the Aether Foundation really protect\nall the Pokémon that’re out there?[VAR 0114(0007)]
Nature does have its own balance, of course.\c\nIt can be difficult to judge just how much we\nhumans should try to affect that, can’t it?[VAR 0114(0016)]
That’s pretty amazing!\nThe Aether Foundation seems awesome.\c\nBut why’d you bother setting up a branch in\na place like Alola?![VAR 0114(0007)]
I couldn’t say...\c\nIt’s hard to know for sure what our president\nis thinking sometimes.[VAR 0114(0016)]
If you’d like to meet President Lusamine, she\nshould be here in the conservation area now.[VAR 0114(0016)]

This is where we look after the Pokémon that\nare commonly known as “regional variants.”[VAR 0114(0016)]
There are several species of Pokémon that\nseem to have adapted to the Alola region.\c\nThey have different appearances, and even\ntypes, in Alola than they do in other regions.[VAR 0114(0016)]
What is it in the climate and features of this \nregion that is affecting the Pokémon?\c\nWe are trying to determine that by testing\ndifferent parameters such as the local soil,\r\nwater, and temperature.[VAR 0114(0016)]
We’ve been aided in our research by Professor\nOak, who is in Ula’ula, among others...[VAR 0114(0016)]
Oh yeah, I remember!\c\nThe Meowth in your house is different from the\nones in Alola, isn’t it, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0007)]
Yeah
It is?
So that’s why! I never knew that Alola was\nso cool like that. Regional variants, huh?[VAR 0114(0007)]
Ha ha ha! OK, next time we’re back home,\n[VAR TRNAME(0000)], we should compare Meowth![VAR 0114(0007)]
Let me show you the next area.[VAR 0114(0016)]
If you’d like to meet President Lusamine,\nshe’s here in the conservation area now.[VAR 0114(0016)]

I’m glad there are people like you, who travel\nthe islands to learn more about Pokémon...[VAR 0114(0014)]
But there are also those unfortunate\npeople who harm Pokémon for their\r\nown selfish reasons or even for profit.[VAR 0114(0014)]
And that is why I am here.\c\nI will be like a mother to all of those poor\nPokémon and shower them with love.[VAR 0114(0014)]
Even Pokémon from distant worlds, far from\nthe Alola region, are worthy of my love.[VAR 0114(0014)]

The empty sky broke asunder,\na hole appearing where had been none.\nA single beast appeared from in it:\nit was called the beast that devours the sun.\c\nThe king of Alola bowed before it:\nthe beast that shone so like the sun.\nThe island guardians fought against it,\nbut in the end the beast had won.\c\nThen did the beast that devours the sun\nshine its light on the line of kings.\nThen did the beast that had won\nbring nature’s gift to bless all things.\c\nBeast of sun and beast of moon.\nThrough their union, they brought new life.\nA fragile heir in Alola born\nthat island guardians would keep from strife.\c\nThe ancient kings sang their thanks\nfor Solgaleo with song of flute.\nTwo tones rang out across the altar—\na perfect pair, ever after mute.

Isn’t it great?\nMy dad’s books are all great![VAR 0114(0030)]
What? I mean, yes, it is.\nBut when you say your father...\r\nIsn’t this book...very old?[VAR 0114(0006)]
Yeah, it belonged to my dad.\c\nI know I don’t look it, but my family used to be\npretty much royalty.[VAR 0114(0011)]
I had to have all my dad’s books moved here\nso they didn’t get ruined by the Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0011)]
I can tell you lots of other old stories about\nAlola, too! You interested?[VAR 0114(0011)]
Well...that would be wonderful!\nI would be delighted, if you did.[VAR 0114(0006)]
I think I’ll stay here...\nBut I know why you’ve come to Ula’ula.\c\nYou’ll be undergoing another trial, won’t you,\n[VAR TRNAME(0000)]? Good luck with it.\c\nI read that Ula’ula Island’s Electric-type trial\ncan only be reached by the bus on Route 10.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Oh!\nYou’re a trial-goer!\c\nYou’re just a few steps away from the trial at\nMount Hokulani!\c\nWell, a few steps and a bus ride, that is.\nYou can catch the bus from Route 10.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Oh! [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\nI didn’t forget...\c\nYou’re here to clear the Ula’ula trials, right?\nGood luck![VAR 0114(0006)]
Oh, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\nHave you finished your next trial?\c\nI heard that there is a trial held on top of\nMount Hokulani, of all places.[VAR 0114(0006)]
She’s just like a real princess, don’t you think?\nAll frilly and sweet smelling...[VAR 0114(0011)]

Mount Hokulani is the second tallest mountain\nin Alola.\c\nAnd the tallest...[VAR 0114(0005)]

It’s a sacred spot, yeah, the closest you can\never get to the Legendary Pokémon of Alola,\r\nsaid to be the sun incarnate.[VAR 0114(0005)]

We’ll get everybody who’s finished their island\nchallenges, yeah, and up there on the peak of\r\nMount Lanakila, they’ll battle against the\r\nkahunas to become the island\r\nchallenge champion!\c\nI’ve always valued our old traditions here in\nAlola, but it’s time to make a Champion the\r\nwhole world will recognize!\c\nIt’s time to get our own Elite Four and make our\nown Pokémon League![VAR 0114(0005)]
To think that, someday, the kiddos in Alola will\nbe able to go from being the island challenge\r\nchampion to the world Champion!\c\nAnd then, when we have our own Champion,\nthey can show the rest of the world what’s so\r\nspecial about Alolan Pokémon and their\r\nTrainers, yeah![VAR 0114(0005)]

Hey there![VAR 0114(0005)]
You’re still as fired up as ever, eh, “Royal”?[VAR 0114(0030)]
Ha! [VAR TRNAME(0000)], lemme introduce you.\nThis is Molayne.\c\nHe runs the observatory here, and also\nmanages PC boxes, but he’s not\r\nHokulani’s captain.[VAR 0114(0005)]
But I was the captain once, my masked friend.[VAR 0114(001C)]
It’s [VAR TRNAME(0000)], right? Thanks for coming\nall the way up Hokulani to visit us.\c\nBut our Captain Sophocles is a busy young man.\c\nAlways calculating comets’ paths or working on\nthat Festival Plaza thing of his...[VAR 0114(001C)]
So I’ll just determine whether you’re qualified to\ntake on the trial.[VAR 0114(001C)]
I’ll heal your team first, of course.[VAR 0114(001C)]
I’ll gladly show you the skills of a Trainer who\ntoughened up while adventuring alongside\r\nKukui back in the day![VAR 0114(001C)]
Well, well, you certainly seem qualified to take\non the trial.[VAR 0114(001C)]
Yeah, I think [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0100)]she’s even stronger than we were\nat this point of our island challenge![VAR 0114(0005)]
One more thing, cousin—the name’s Kukui!\nWho’s this Masked Royal you’re talking about?![VAR 0114(0005)]
All right, cousin, I’m heading back to\nMalie Garden.\c\nI figure Hau should be done eating malasada by\nnow, yeah?\c\nI’ll make sure he makes it up here, too.[VAR 0114(0005)]

You summon the Totem Pokémon and prove\nyour strength to it...\c\nThat’s what every trial boils down to, right?[VAR 0114(0010)]
So I thought...\c\nWhy not just call the totem here from\nthe start?[VAR 0114(0010)]
So I tried a bit of this and that, and I think I’ve\nwhipped up a little device to call the\r\nTotem Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0010)]
Perhaps you’re wondering why I built\na machine?\c\nHere at the observatory, we also monitor\nsounds that we detect from outer space.\c\nThere are some sounds that are inaudible to\npeople but Pokémon can hear just fine.[VAR 0114(0010)]
We broadcast the sounds we have gathered\nterrestrially and monitor the reactions\r\nof Pokémon.\c\nThe machine that summons the Totem Pokémon\nmakes use of this technology...[VAR 0114(0010)]
Utilizing other sounds we have gathered, we\nalso developed a security system here...\r\nBut that was actually Big Mo’s invention.[VAR 0114(0010)]
Just so you know...\c\nThis will actually be my first time trying it out,\nso I’m glad you came. I needed a test subject.[VAR 0114(0010)]
Ping Totem Pokémon 2.0, engage![VAR 0114(0010)]

It seems that your Ping Totem Pokémon 2.0\nuses too much electricity.\c\nIf we can get a little assistance from Charjabug,\nwe should be able to make some improvements.[VAR 0114(001C)]
Here, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].\c\nI’ll give you this Electrium Z to reward you for\nbeating the Totem Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0010)]

Congratulations on clearing your trial!\c\nAnd you, Sophocles.\nYou did well as captain.[VAR 0114(001C)]
I was really nervous...[VAR 0114(0010)]
Don’t you worry. I’m sure that I made the right\nchoice in naming you captain.\c\nEven if you are my cousin.[VAR 0114(001C)]
Usually it’s the island kahuna who appoints\nthe captains.\c\nBut there are some, er, unusual circumstances\nhere on Ula’ula.[VAR 0114(001C)]
So somehow I ended up captain...[VAR 0114(0010)]
But you were really great, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].[VAR 0114(0010)]
I see...\nThen let me reward you![VAR 0114(001C)]
This is one of the Z-Crystals that I collected\nlong ago during my own island challenge to\r\nprove my strength and that of my Pokémon.\c\nSo it seems fitting that it go from me to you.\nTake it, and use it well.[VAR 0114(001C)]
And if we’re done here, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]...\nCould I ask you to do a favor for me?\r\nProfessor Kukui forgot this.[VAR 0114(001C)]
He said he would be going back to Malie Garden.\nCould you take it to him?[VAR 0114(001C)]
Maybe next time we can battle...[VAR 0114(0010)]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Come on! Hurry it up, yo!\nWe’ve gotta get to Malie Garden, quick![VAR 0114(0031)]

Yo, yo, yo!\nHold up, yo, Mr. Kukui![VAR 0114(0031)]
You say you wanna make a Pokémon League?\nYou got rocks in your skull?[VAR 0114(0032)]
Four turns![VAR 0114(0005)]
Huh?[VAR 0114(0031)]
Bring it on, the both of you! I’ve been\nresearching Pokémon moves, yeah, so I’m\r\nalways ready, oh yeah!\c\nI’ll take you both on in a Battle Royal, and you’ll\nbe down with just a Swift and Incinerate or two!\c\nYou gotta beat the man to be the man, boys![VAR 0114(0005)]
Yo, for real?[VAR 0114(0031)]
F-fine! You asked for it![VAR 0114(0032)]
Get ’em good, Professor!
You numskulls should learn your place!
Battle Royal, huh? Nice idea there, Kukui.\nYou can beat down three Pokémon at\r\nonce, huh?[VAR 0114(0030)]
It’s Guzma...

We have an exciting bout for you tonight! In the\nopposing corner, the Pokémon professor Kukui!\r\nAnd in this corner, the boss of Team Skull and\r\nthe hardest guy around, Guzma![VAR 0114(0017)]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Text File : 223

Here we are, Kukui...\c\nFellow rejects who never could\nbecome captains.[VAR 0114(0017)]
We’ve got all these moldy old\ntraditions in Alola—the kahunas, the captains...\c\nIt’s about time we cut out all that silly garbage\nand make something new for ourselves.\r\nTrust me, I get that.[VAR 0114(0017)]
Don’t get me wrong, though, Kukui.\nWe’ve got no need for a Pokémon League.\c\nAfter all, everyone already knows who the\nstrongest Trainer is on these islands![VAR 0114(0017)]
Speak for yourself, Guzma.\c\nIt’s not like I couldn’t become a captain.\nI chose not to. I had other dreams, see?[VAR 0114(0005)]
I wanted to figure out which moves would\nbe strong enough to beat old Hala...\r\nand I finally found what I was looking for.\c\nThe strongest moves you can use are the ones\na Trainer and their Pokémon choose together...\r\nin the heat of the moment, when it really counts.[VAR 0114(0005)]
That’s when I knew I had to make a Pokémon\nLeague, yeah, to give everybody a chance to be\r\npushed to the limit with their team and find that\r\nperfect move!\c\nLet’s see it, Guzma! Show me your moves and\nprove you aren’t just all talk!\c\nIf you really can, that is...[VAR 0114(0005)]
Right, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]?\nDon’t you agree?[VAR 0114(0005)]
That’s right
What?
So you’re one of the kids on h[VAR GENDBR(00FF,0202)]iser island\nchallenge? You don’t look like Hala’s grandson.[VAR 0114(0017)]
This here’s [VAR TRNAME(0000)].\n[VAR GENDBR(00FF,0201)]HShe just moved to Alola recently.\c\nDiscovery! New experiences! Adventure!\n[VAR GENDBR(00FF,0201)]HShe’s loving every minute of it![VAR 0114(0005)]
[VAR TRNAME(0000)] and h[VAR GENDBR(00FF,0202)]iser [VAR PKNAME(0001)] can\nunleash some real powerful moves.\c\nSo if you think you’re the strongest Trainer on\nthese islands, Guzma, why don’t you battle h[VAR GENDBR(00FF,0202)]imer?[VAR 0114(0005)]
Tch! This move fanatic is getting me all riled up![VAR 0114(0017)]
You’ve got a Z-Ring, huh, kid?[VAR 0114(0017)]
Why even bother with the island challenge?\nWhat’s the point of it?[VAR 0114(0017)]
It’ll make me strong
That’s what I want to find out
No it won’t, you dumb kid!\c\nWatch closely, Kukui.\c\nSomeday I’m gonna destroy you.\nBut first, I’ll destroy everything you care about![VAR 0114(0017)]
Ha! You don’t even know why you’re doing it.\c\nWatch closely, Kukui.\c\nSomeday I’m gonna destroy you.\nBut first, I’ll destroy everything you care about![VAR 0114(0017)]
Wanna see what destruction looks like?\nHere it is in human form—it’s your boy Guzma![VAR 0114(0017)]
Guzma!!!\nWhat is wrong with you?!\c\nNow’s the time for your vaunted team to let\nloose and destroy everything![VAR 0114(0017)]
It was [VAR TRNAME(0000)], right?\c\nI’ll remember you...as someone I’ll be happy\nto beat down anytime![VAR 0114(0017)]
Don’t mess with the boss, yo!\nYou don’t want him to get serious![VAR 0114(0031)]
Team Skull will have to go lick their wounds now!\nGetting beat by a child just doing h[VAR GENDBR(00FF,0202)]iser trials!
Aue, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\nYou are one righteous Trainer!

Those were some nice moves!\nI can feel my soul shaking![VAR 0114(0005)]

You handed the mask to the professor!
So what happened to Lillie?\nYou lose her somewhere, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0005)]
I’m right here.[VAR 0114(0006)]
And so is Acerola![VAR 0114(0011)]
And Hau is...probably at a malasada shop\nsomewhere, yeah?[VAR 0114(0005)]
You and the professor fought those horrible\nTeam Skull thugs, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]?\r\nJust thinking about it makes me worry...\r\nThey sound like a scary group...[VAR 0114(0006)]
You think? I don’t know. Exchanging a few\nmoves in battle is the quickest way to get to\r\nknow someone in my book.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Well, I’m going to head up Mount Lanakila.\c\nI’ve gotta make sure the Pokémon League gets\nfinished and everybody has the chance to find\r\ntheir own perfect move!\c\nKeep training hard on your island challenge,\n[VAR TRNAME(0000)], and one day you’ll make\r\nit there![VAR 0114(0005)]
[VAR TRNAME(0000)]...\nBe sure you’re not pushing yourself too hard.[VAR 0114(0006)]
[VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\nYou made it through Sophocles’s trial, huh?\c\nThat’s really great!\nYou can take on the next trial up past Route 11.\r\nThrough Tapu Village, you know?\c\nIf you get lost on your way, ask a police officer\nfor directions. They’re here to serve, right?[VAR 0114(0011)]
Now, Lillie, you’re coming with me to do\nsome shopping![VAR 0114(0011)]

It looks like you haven’t yet earned your\nElectrium Z, have you?\c\nTake the bus that leaves from Route 10, and\ncomplete the trial that awaits you at the\r\nHokulani Observatory!
Ho! Look at that blinding yellow Electrium Z!
Now I guess I’ll have to open the gate for you!
What you face up ahead is the Ghost-type trial.\nI hope you enjoy it!

Mudsdale was registered to your Ride Pager!
It was remiss of me not to register her\nfor you when we met one another in Malie.\c\nI was just so taken aback by Lillie and how\nlovely she was that it escaped me.\c\nBy no means was I just waiting for a time when\nyou were in trouble![VAR 0114(000B)]

If you seek the next trial, go straight\non through here to Tapu Village.\c\nI’ll be cheering for you on your island challenge![VAR 0114(000B)]

I heard the news from Sophocles!\c\nYou helped him out with testing da kine, yeah?\nThat totem-calling machine or whatever?\c\nI guess I was test subject number two!\nBut I managed to get through the trial.\r\nMaybe even managed to get a bit stronger, eh?[VAR 0114(0007)]

Gah! He’s back![VAR 0114(0007)]
Listen, Team Skull is looking for a Pokémon\ncalled Cosmog...\c\nDo you two know anything?[VAR 0114(0013)]
What?!\c\nN-not that we’d tell you![VAR 0114(0007)]
So you do know something.\c\nLook...\nCosmog isn’t even a strong Pokémon.\c\nBut it has the potential to summon Pokémon\nso terrifyingly strong that you don’t even know.\c\nIf something like that happened, it would be\na disaster for Alola...[VAR 0114(0013)]
A disaster? Like...a real disaster?\nThen what’re we supposed to do about it?[VAR 0114(0007)]
Protect it! If you do know where Cosmog is\nor if you do find anything out...just keep it safe!\c\nI know I might be working for Team Skull right\nnow, so you may not trust me or care but...\r\nI’m going to tell you this just once.\c\nYou have to protect Cosmog...\nno matter what![VAR 0114(0013)]
I still don’t even understand how Team Skull\nfound out about Cosmog in the first place...[VAR 0114(0013)]
What do you mean? No matter what?\nYou just gonna leave us hanging?![VAR 0114(0007)]
[VAR TRNAME(0000)]...\c\nIf they’re really looking for Cosmog, then...\nIs Lillie gonna be OK?[VAR 0114(0007)]
I don’t really get what’s going on, but we’ve\njust got to keep both of them safe, right?!\c\nThen I know what I’m gonna do...\nTake on my next trial so I can get even stronger![VAR 0114(0007)]
I’m gonna complete my island challenge, and I’m\ngonna get Tapu Koko to recognize my strength,\r\nthen I’m gonna be the next island kahuna!\c\nI want to make sure more and more people can\nhave fun battling to see who wins or loses! \c\n[VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\nLet’s both try to become real champions![VAR 0114(0007)]

Greetings, trial-goer!\nI’m afraid this is a captain’s barricade.\c\nOnly those who pass the Ghost-type trial\ncan come through here.
Ho! That’s Ghostium Z right there!\c\nThen let me just get this thing out of the way\nfor you! One second...
Beyond this gate stretches the great expanse\nof Haina Desert.\r\nIt’s a bit different every day, due to the winds.
Oh, hey! Um, if you’ve got one to spare...\nthink you could front me a Fresh Water?
Oh! Thanks, friend!\nHere, let me give you these in return.\c\nThey’re Adrenaline Orbs.\c\nDon’t you feel like the Pokémon that other\nPokémon call to help them in battle are, like,\r\nstronger? And even more likely to be Shiny?
My partner is a Poliwhirl with the Water Absorb\nAbility, so it loves a little dousing now and then.
Well, thanks for wanting to help!\nBut it looks like you don’t have a Fresh Water.\c\nIf you remember me, hopefully you can bring me\none next time you’re passing through here!
I get it! Your Fresh Waters are precious to you.\c\nBut if you remember me, maybe you can bring\nan extra for me next time!

Hey, look! Construction workers!\nThat must be what Kukui was talking about!\c\nSo they’re really making a Pokémon League\nup on top of Mount Lanakila...[VAR 0114(0007)]
The professor told me that Pokémon Leagues\nin other regions have four crazy-strong Trainers\r\nin them that they call the Elite Four![VAR 0114(0007)]

This old building is full of lots of Ghost-type\nPokémon. Did you know?\c\nHere’s where the trial part comes in.\c\nYou’ve got to find the Totem Pokémon of this\nsite and snap a shot of it with a Poké Finder![VAR 0114(0011)]
The totem is a bit of a trickster, and it likes to\nplay hide-and-seek and mess around.\c\nIf you take pictures of the other Ghost-type\nPokémon inside, it’ll definitely come out to get\r\nin on the fun and have its photo taken, too![VAR 0114(0011)]
So, if you see something weird happening inside\nthis old place, try to check it out.\c\nI bet you’ll find a Ghost-type Pokémon causing\nthe mischief, so get its photo before it’s gone![VAR 0114(0011)]
I’ll just borrow your Poké Finder for a sec.\c\nHee hee!\nAnd your Rotom is a Ghost type, too![VAR 0114(0011)]
We just do this, and...[VAR 0114(0011)]
There! I’ve set it up to use a special shooting\nmode just for this trial.\c\nYou’ll only be able to use it at this site, though.[VAR 0114(0011)]
As soon as you enter the building, your trial\nwill begin. Got it?\c\nAnd you can’t catch any of the Pokémon, either.\c\nAnd you can’t leave without giving up, too, so\nmake sure you’re ready for anything![VAR 0114(0011)]
As soon as you enter the building, your trial\nwill begin. Got it?\c\nAnd you can’t catch any of the Pokémon, either.\c\nAlso, you can’t leave without giving up, so make\nsure you’re ready for anything![VAR 0114(0011)]

You need some advice, [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0B07)]big boyclever girl?\c\nStart by having a look around to find any of\nthose tricky Pokémon hiding about, zzt-zzt.\c\nWhen you spot one, lock your Finder on it so\nthe Pokémon is right in the middle of your shot!\r\nThen snap a nice close-up of the pest, zzt-zzt![VAR 0114(0035)]
Looks like the Pokémon you’re supposed to\nsnap like to play hide-and-seek, zzz-zzt!\c\nHave a look around this old place, and if you\nfind a Pokémon, zoom in on it and snap a shot\r\nwith it right up and centered in your Finder! Zzt![VAR 0114(0035)]

Yup! That’s Mimikyu all right!\c\nIt’s pretty hard to catch it on film, so this is a\nreally great attempt!\c\nWhich means...[VAR 0114(0011)]
You received a Z-Crystal from Acerola!
You obtained a Ghost-type Z-Crystal!\nThe Ghostium Z is yours!
If you want to use a Ghost-type Z-Power, then \nyou’ve got to move like this![VAR 0114(0011)]
And since you passed my trial, [VAR TRNAME(0000)],\nyou now have my permission to catch Pokémon\r\nin the trial site. So, in that old building there.\c\nHere you go![VAR 0114(0011)]
It’s not a bad idea to have some Ghost-type\nPokémon on your team![VAR 0114(0011)]
What’s that?\c\nYou say the Poké Finder just started up on its\nown, during your trial?\c\nOooh, cut it out, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\nYou’re trying to scare me, huh?\c\nYou’ll have to come up with something a bit\nmore believable than that!\c\nThere’s not even any room in the back of that\nshop, for starters!\r\nHow gullible do you think I am?[VAR 0114(0011)]

Mimikyu is a pretty tough opponent, isn’t it?\c\nIt’s a Ghost- and Fairy-type Pokémon.\nDid you know?\c\nNeither type has a lot of weaknesses,\nso it’s tricky to beat.\c\nYou probably want to try Ghost- or Steel-type\nmoves against it.\c\nI’m sure you’ll beat it this time!\nDon’t give up on my trial yet!

Man oh man...\nWhat is going on today?\c\nSomeone actually bothered coming to this kind\nof sad place?[VAR 0114(0030)]
Well, no matter. I’ll take you on.\nKeep you company.\c\nTell me. Uncle Grimsley is going to flip a coin.\nWill it be heads or tails?[VAR 0114(0028)]
Heads
Tails
Neither

...Astonishing.\c\nI had indeed been planning to have Skarmory\nsnatch it out of the air as it spun in the sky.[VAR 0114(0028)]

Seems to me you’re trying to get into Po Town.\nYou sure you’ve thought this through?\c\nYou’d better be ready if you’re thinking of\ncoming in here.\c\nReady to live as Team Skull.\nOr ready to take on Team Skull.
You really think you’re ready for that?
I am!
Maybe?
Run back home, kid.
I guess everyone has their own reasons.\c\nI’ve got my reasons, too, for doing what I do.\c\nI’ll have them let you in.
If you don’t make it, I’ll be sure your remains\nat least get back home.

We’re gonna get strong enough for anything,\neven if we don’t have that old barricade!
I’m not the bad one here.\c\nThe real bad ones are whatever fools decided\nthat I’m bad!
I can never make Pokémon give it their all in\nbattles. I guess it’s my bad...
I’ve been thinking of how I can get my Pokémon\nto really bring out their power...\c\nIt’s not like I wanna work my fingers to the bone\ntrying to get strong, though.
Yo! If you wanna pass through here, then how\nabout you hand over $10,000,000?\c\nIf I had that much, I wouldn’t have to do\nanything anymore!\c\nWhat’s that? You don’t have it?\nThen I’ll take whatever you do have!
Ahhhh! I’ve lost it!\nAhhh! The battle and my motivation!
Ever since Team Skull broke up, I’ve been\nkeeping busy not doing anything.\r\nWhat a charmed life I live!

How about I guess what you’re looking for?\nCosmog, right?\c\nIf you want to know what kinds of experiments\nwe did with it, then you’ll have to beat me!
[~ 7]
All I can tell you is that Cosmog is the key.\nIt’s the tool needed to open the Ultra Wormhole.\c\nBut I’m no good at battling. So I’m out of here!
[~ 9]
[~ 10]
It’s not here...[VAR 0114(0013)]
Don’t even think about getting in here.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Me and Null...\nWe’re more alike than we might look.\r\nWe’re both what we were made to be...[VAR 0114(0013)]
I was like an ornament to my mother.\nWearing whatever she told me to wear,\r\nacting however she wanted me to act...[VAR 0114(0013)]
Null was crafted just as carefully.\nIt was made just to battle the beasts.\r\nIn this room...right here...[VAR 0114(0013)]
Just...just leave it alone.\nDid you check out the other lab?[VAR 0114(0013)]

Wh-what are you kids doing in here?!\nDon’t touch anything with your grimy hands!
This research is our life! I don’t care if you’re a\nkid or what. I’ll send you flying if you threaten it!
I may be an expert at studying Pokémon, but\nI’m no expert when it comes to battling them.
But the guys in Lab A next door...\nThey’re pretty experienced with battles.\c\nAfter all, they spent so long researching that\nuncontrollable Pokémon...
Hey. Focus, people.\nWhere’re Lillie and Cosmog?[VAR 0114(0007)]
We may have lost, but that doesn’t mean we’re\ngoing to help you. I’m not telling you anything.
She’s not here, is she?\nEven you can see that.
Come on, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\nLet’s split up and look around.\r\nMaybe we’ll find some clue![VAR 0114(0007)]
Come on, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\nAt least help me look around, would ya?[VAR 0114(0007)]
Aether Report: Ultra Wormholes\c\nBeyond the Ultra Wormholes that Professor \nMohn discovered lies a different dimension.\c\nBy investigating the changes in mass there, we\ncan predict the existence of Pokémon-like life.\c\nWe have dubbed them Ultra Beasts for now.
Aether Report: Cosmog\c\nCosmog is hypothesized to be a type of\nUltra Beast that hails from another dimension.\r\nA dimension that we have named Ultra Space.\c\nWhen placed under sufficient stress, it reveals\nthe power to create and open Ultra Wormholes\r\nin order to escape from its suffering.\c\nWe are now working on a device that will allow\nus to manipulate the Ultra Wormholes created\r\nwhen Cosmog is subjected to extreme stress...
Wait... So Cosmog might be an Ultra Beast?[VAR 0114(0007)]
We should tell Gladion about this![VAR 0114(0007)]

Did you find anything?[VAR 0114(0013)]
We learned a bit about Cosmog!\c\nLike, it might be an Ultra Beast or whatever...\nand if you stress it a lot, it can create Ultra\r\nWormholes! Maybe to run away or something?[VAR 0114(0007)]
If you stress it...\c\nIf you hurt it—is that what you mean?\c\nWas that why she ran away with it?[VAR 0114(0013)]
But we didn’t find any sign of it down here.[VAR 0114(0007)]
Yeah...\nFaba probably knew this would be a dead end.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Darn... Did he outsmart us?[VAR 0114(0013)]
Gladion never really explains anything, eh?\nProbably thinks it makes him look cool...[VAR 0114(0007)]
Should we go after him?\nWe all got into this together.\c\nMight as well see it to the end together![VAR 0114(0007)]

Fine, fine. We can do that.\nBut do you have to say “hmph” all the time?[VAR 0114(0007)]
Hello, children.\nI’m afraid Branch Chief Faba has given us\r\norders regarding you three...

So, uh, Mr. Faba, do you have the key to the\npresident’s rooms?[VAR 0114(0007)]

Calling me mother?\nI don’t have any children!\c\nCertainly not any wretched children who would\nrun off and reject my love![VAR 0114(0014)]
So tell me how you’ll save that Pokémon.\nWhat can you do, Lillie?\c\nYou failed to convince me to listen to you.\nYou don’t even have the strength of a Trainer.\c\nThe only thing that you’ve ever done on your\nown is steal someone else’s research material![VAR 0114(0014)]
You’re not beautiful enough for my world...\c\nbut fine.\c\nSince you’re here anyway, you can watch me\nsummon my sweet beast.\c\nAnd then...you can leave.[VAR 0114(0014)]
I’m not being foolish or selfish...\c\nI am asking you to listen, Mother!\nDo not sacrifice Cosmog for that beast’s sake![VAR 0114(0006)]
If you open the Ultra Wormhole, Cosmog will...\nCosmog will die![VAR 0114(0006)]
You’re right...\nit probably will die.\c\nBecause I’m going to force it to use its power\nwhether it wants to or not![VAR 0114(0014)]

Yes, it’s me!\nNow I’m ready to use my full force, too![VAR 0114(0006)]
You look...fantastic![VAR 0114(0007)]
What was that?[VAR 0114(0013)]
I’m going to train even harder!\nI’ve gotta do more![VAR 0114(0007)]
I keep getting saved by [VAR TRNAME(0000)] and\nh[VAR GENDBR(0000,0202)]iser Pokémon, don’t I?[VAR 0114(0007)]
That’s not enough.\nI’ve gotta be able to save Pokémon on my own!\c\nIf I can’t do that, I’ll never be an island kahuna.\nI’ll never be able to make people really smile![VAR 0114(0007)]
And I still haven’t even done Acerola’s trial\nor anything. I’ve got a lot of catching up to do.[VAR 0114(0007)]
Sorry for dragging you into our family mess.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Yeah...\c\nBut we got to see things that almost no one\nwould ever get the chance to see!\c\nMaybe if I set out to train harder, I’ll get to see\nmore amazing things like that again![VAR 0114(0007)]
Yeah. Our mother does like to do things on an...\nextravagant scale.[VAR 0114(0013)]
I was really glad that you came, too, Hau.[VAR 0114(0006)]
I can get you to the next island at least.\nPoni Island.\c\nI’ll wait for you at the docks.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Come on, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\nLet’s show the world what we can really do![VAR 0114(0006)]
Guess I should wish you guys a good trip, huh?\c\nI’m gonna train up myself and my team real good\nbefore I see you again, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].\c\nBe ready for the shock of a lifetime![VAR 0114(0007)]

All right.[VAR 0114(0013)]

Poni Island...\c\nAlmost no one lives on it, but you’ll find a whole\nlot of nature to explore here.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Go. Find the kahuna.[VAR 0114(0013)]
The kahuna of Poni Island also protects the\nshrine where Alola’s people worship the\r\nLegendary Pokémon.\c\nMaybe they will know something that might\nhelp you.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Gladion...\c\nthank you for this.[VAR 0114(0006)]
But...but when you took Null and left Aether\nParadise two years ago...\r\nyou left me alone with Mother!\r\nShe was so bad after you left!\c\nIf I hadn’t had Wicke with me...[VAR 0114(0006)]
I’m sorry...\c\nI wasn’t there for you when you needed me.\c\nAll I could think about back then was finding a\nway to save Null...\c\nThat was the battle I was fighting.\c\nBut now you’ve found your own battle to fight.\nI know you can handle it.[VAR 0114(0013)]
[VAR TRNAME(0000)].\nI’m OK. You don’t have to worry.\r\nI know what I have to do now.[VAR 0114(0006)]
And...\c\nI don’t know. Maybe it sounds strange, but...\c\nI’m kind of excited.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Poni Island, here we come! Bzzt-zzt!\c\nWonder what kinds of new Pokémon we’ll get to\nrub elbows with here, eh, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]?\r\nIf only I had elbows! Bzzzzzzt![VAR 0114(0035)]

Nice to see a new face around here![VAR 0114(0030)]
Oh my goodness![VAR 0114(0006)]
I-I’m sorry. Who are you?[VAR 0114(0006)]
Me? I’m the chief of the seafolk.\nIt’s my job to keep everybody together.
The...seafolk?[VAR 0114(0006)]
Yes, ma’am!\c\nWhat’d you think all these boats ’round\nyou are here for?
We seafolk have spent years navigating the\nseas and searching out new wonders.\c\nWhen we find rare things, we bring ’em here\nto Alola to trade.
The ports on the other islands are busier\nthese days, but we still always seem to end\r\nup back here on Poni, eh?
What did you all come here for?\nYou collecting Berries, like us? 
We’re here to visit the kahuna.[VAR 0114(0006)]
The kahuna? Hmm.\c\nMaybe you should go to little Hapu’s place?\c\nHer house is the only one still standing on Poni,\nafter all. Where else would you go, eh?
You can recognize little Hapu’s house at a\nglance...thanks to that huge Mudsdale of hers.
Oh! So Hapu lives here on Poni Island?\c\nThank you very much, Chief![VAR 0114(0006)]
Let’s go, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\c\nIt will be good to see Hapu and Mudsdale again![VAR 0114(0006)]

I’ll do my best to keep up, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].[VAR 0114(0006)]
I’ll be fine! I’ve got Max Repels with me.\c\nAnd I’ve got you, too...[VAR 0114(0006)]
Poni Island...\nIt’s a completely different kind of island, isn’t it?[VAR 0114(0006)]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Ni-hiiii!
It’s good to see you again, too, Mudsdale!\nYou look to be in fine form.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Wow...\nPokémon Trainers really do amaze me.\c\nIt seems like a hard path to walk, and even so,\nyou don’t let yourself be held back by the fear\r\nof seeing your Pokémon friends get hurt...\c\nYou just keep striving forward together...[VAR 0114(0006)]
Oh! Been a while, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].\c\nAnd you brought Lillie along, too?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Yes. It’s good to see you, Hapu![VAR 0114(0006)]
You look different...like you’re ready to go all out\nin something now.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Thank you, Hapu.\nI’ve finally discovered what I need to do.\r\nSo this is my Z-Powered form![VAR 0114(0006)]
Ho! Then you do your best, Lillie.[VAR 0114(000B)]
No one could call you lily-livered![VAR 0114(000B)]
Um, so, Hapu...do you know where we can find\nthe kahuna?[VAR 0114(0006)]
The kahuna?\c\nHrmm.\nDon’t have one here on Poni.[VAR 0114(000B)]
What?![VAR 0114(0006)]
Now what do we do, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]...?[VAR 0114(0006)]
Hmph...\nWell, I suppose the time might be right now...\c\nI already finished up my battle against that odd\nlittle thing that appeared out of the sky...[VAR 0114(000B)]
All right. Let us all proceed to the ruins.\nYou stick with me, you two.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Ni-hiiii!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Text File : 294

[VAR TRNAME(0000)]...\nwe just have to keep going, right!\c\nBut then again...you are a Trainer, aren’t you?\nI suppose you always keep moving forward![VAR 0114(0006)]
Wait there.[VAR 0114(0030)]
Eek![VAR 0114(0006)]
I-I’m sorry. I don’t think we’ve been introduced...[VAR 0114(0006)]
Ho ho ho!\nI’m Hapu’s old gran.\c\nAre you two friends with my girl?
Yes, we are
How did you guess?
Ho ho ho!\nSo she has friends now!
Ho ho ho!\nYou’d tease an old woman, eh?
Traveling around the islands...\nmaking new friends...\r\nYou kids are luckier than you know.
If you want to head for the Poni Island ruins,\nhow about a bit of help from this old gran?\r\nHere. Hand over your Ride Pager a moment.
Machamp was registered to your Ride Pager!
[~ 12]
You’ll need to move some big obstacles to make\nit down the path that you two hope to travel.
I wish you both a bright future.
My Hapu was heading for the Ruins of Hope,\nwasn’t she? Go after her.\c\nFirst, you’ll come to Poni Breaker Coast.\nYou’ll know it by the soil—it’s black as pitch.\r\nGo through there, and you’ll find the ruins.
Thank you very much, ma’am!\nYou have been a great help![VAR 0114(0006)]
The Ruins of Hope...\c\nthat is where the guardian of Poni Island will be.\nThat is where Tapu Fini lives.\c\nLet’s go![VAR 0114(0006)]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Text File : 295

The Ruins of Hope...[VAR 0114(0006)]
What is this place...?\nThe air feels so oppressive...[VAR 0114(0006)]
But...but if we go in there...\c\nmaybe Nebby will return to normal![VAR 0114(0006)]
The people believe that the guardian deity of\nthese ruins, Tapu Fini, can wash away any\r\nimpurities with its mystic water...[VAR 0114(0006)]
That sounds promising
You think that’ll work?
That’s right it does, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\c\nI’m going to give it my all so that we can return\nNebby back to normal![VAR 0114(0006)]
Oh, honestly, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\c\nI’m going to make sure that Nebby gets right\nback to normal, just to show you![VAR 0114(0006)]
So just you wait, Nebby!\c\nThis time I’m going to be the one who saves you![VAR 0114(0006)]
Come on, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\nLet’s go![VAR 0114(0006)]
Ni-hiiii!

If we’re going to break a path, we’ll need to\nmove these huge rocks![VAR 0114(0006)]
That’s what Hapu’s grandmother said, isn’t it?[VAR 0114(0006)]
...Unghhh![VAR 0114(0006)]
I don’t think I can do this...\nI-it’s heavier than words can even express...[VAR 0114(0006)]
We’ll have to borrow Machamp’s formidable\nstrength for this task.\c\nI read about it once in a book.\nIf I remember right, it said...\c\n“When getting a ride from a powerful Machamp,\nTrainers can activate Machamp’s [VAR COLOR(0001)]Shove[VAR COLOR(0000)] by\r\nstanding before a rock and pressing !”\c\nAnd if we find ourselves getting frustrated,\nwe should probably remember to step outside\r\nagain for a bit of perspective.[VAR 0114(0006)]
When Hapu spoke of an “odd little thing” from\nthe sky...do you think she meant a beast?\c\nWhat do you think Hapu brought us here for?\c\nSo many of the things that Trainers do are\nstill a mystery to me...[VAR 0114(0006)]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Text File : 297
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I’ve read about them, you know...\c\nAlola’s sacred ruins...and the guardian deities\nworshipped within them.\c\nThey go wherever they want, so it’s not easy to\nmeet them...according to the books I’ve read.\c\nBut if they are summoned here at the ruins,\nthey do sometimes appear.[VAR 0114(0006)]
The books say that they are, well, capricious.\c\nEncounters with them do not always end as\nyou hope they will.\c\nMaybe that explains why...\c\neven coming here to these ruins hasn’t evoked\nany response from Nebby...[VAR 0114(0006)]
Oh! There’s Hapu![VAR 0114(0006)]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Text File : 298

I give my thanks...
for your great blessing.
As kahuna, I will do my best for the people...
and the Pokémon of Alola.

Text File : 299

Oh! So you two were watching?[VAR 0114(000B)]
The kahunas are chosen by the Pokémon we\nworship here in Alola—our sacred guardians.\c\nThey are chosen from among the people living\non the island each guardian watches over.\c\nLillie told me that you’re pretty new to our parts,\neh, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]?\r\nYou came to Alola from far off?\c\nYou must really be something then.\c\nI heard how you were given a sparkling stone\nby the tapu, even as a stranger to our shores.[VAR 0114(000B)]
My grandfather...\c\nMy grandfather was also chosen for this honor.\nThe honor of being our island’s kahuna.\c\nBut he died suddenly some years back,\nand we were left without a kahuna on Poni.[VAR 0114(000B)]
I tried to follow in his footsteps, but I was not\nchosen by the tapu back then.\c\nSo I set out on my own sort of island challenge,\ntraveling Alola and trying to grow stronger.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Lillie.\c\nThe kahuna you wished to meet is right here.[VAR 0114(000B)]
O-oh! Of course!\c\nThen please, Kahuna Hapu!\nTell me about the Legendary Pokémon![VAR 0114(0006)]
So you want to know about Solgaleo, who we\npay tribute to at the Altar of the Sunne?[VAR 0114(000B)]
So you want to know about Lunala, who we\npay tribute to at the Altar of the Moone?[VAR 0114(000B)]
My mother disappeared into the beast’s world...\c\nI know that she was a terrible person, but she\nis still my mother.\r\nI need to see her again, to tell her something.[VAR 0114(0006)]
That’s why I want to ask the Legendary\nPokémon for its help...\c\nThe Legendary Pokémon is the only one\nwho can go back and forth between worlds![VAR 0114(0006)]
The world of the beasts, eh...\c\nIs that what that thing was that came to\nPoni Island? A beast?\c\nTapu Fini and I tried to fight it, but it nearly\ndid us both in. We did not stand a chance.[VAR 0114(000B)]
All right.\nI will tell you what I know.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Oh, thank you, Hapu![VAR 0114(0006)]
But what I know is not much.\c\nJust that there is a ceremony held for the\nLegendary Pokémon at the altar.\c\nA ceremony that uses two particular flutes to\nsomehow give the Legendary Pokémon power.[VAR 0114(000B)]
This is the Moon Flute.\nIt seems that my mother had it...[VAR 0114(0006)]
This is the Sun Flute.\nIt seems that my mother had it...[VAR 0114(0006)]
Ho! That looks to be the flute that used to\nreside at the lake on Ula’ula.[VAR 0114(000B)]
The other is said to be held on Exeggutor Island.\c\nI do not know why there of all places, but it has\nbeen passed down that that’s where it belongs.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Exeggutor Island...\nI think I’ve read about it before.\c\nIt’s an uninhabited island off the coast of Poni,\nisn’t that right?[VAR 0114(0006)]
Yes. And no reason to dally here.\nLet us go and speak with the seafolk’s chief!\c\nLillie, you take Mudsdale.\nWe proceed to Seafolk Village![VAR 0114(000B)]

Thank you, Hapu!\nAnd thank you, Mudsdale![VAR 0114(0006)]
That’s what friends do.[VAR 0114(000B)]
F-friends...?\c\nAn amazing Trainer like Hapu considers me...\na friend?[VAR 0114(0006)]
Thank you, Hapu!\nI will not give up, no matter what![VAR 0114(0006)]
To journey to Exeggutor Island, you\nshould speak with the chief of the sea folk.\r\nI shall be wishing for your safety![VAR 0114(000B)]
Mu-hiiiiiin!

Did you find her?
Yes!\nAnd Hapu was made the new kahuna![VAR 0114(0006)]
Oh-ho! Now that’s a joy to my ears.\nHer old grandfather must be smiling down on us.
Yes.\nHapu will do her best for her late grandfather...\c\nas I must do my best for my mother’s sake.\nAnd for Nebby, as well.\c\nA-and so!\nThere’s a place that we need to go.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Exeggutor Island
To find the flute
Exeggutor Island...?\nOh, you mean where the flute is!
To find the flute?\nOh, you must want Exeggutor Island!
Well, you two did meet the kahuna already...\c\nand Poni’s captain ain’t around anyway, so\nI guess there’s no point waiting on any trials...
All right! The S.S. Magikarp will have you there,\nand you’ll think you’re sailing in a dream!

Hah... Here we are at Exeggutor Island!\c\nI heard that this place used to be a trial site,\nthough that was a long time ago now.
You go on. Good luck to you both!
You want to go back to Poni Island?
Fair enough. Let’s be going.
I’ll wait around for you then.
Let’s go find that flute! Right?\c\nTrainers really can go anywhere as long as\nthey have their Pokémon, can’t they?\r\nI think I’m beginning to understand the appeal.[VAR 0114(0006)]
You want to head back to Exeggutor Island?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Text File : 303

I feel like Trainers can open up the door to\nany future as long as they have their Pokémon.\c\nThat’s what it looks like to me when I see you,\n[VAR TRNAME(0000)]. And Hapu and Hau, too![VAR 0114(0006)]
Ahhh!\nWhat is that, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]?![VAR 0114(0006)]
Phew...\nThat was an Exeggutor, wasn’t it?\c\nI think that the good weather in Alola has let it\ngrow a bit more vigorously than I’d prefer![VAR 0114(0006)]

Oh! It’s started to rain...[VAR 0114(0006)]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Text File : 305

Rain in Alola, huh...\c\nMy skirt got a bit wet...[VAR 0114(0006)]
Looking out at the rain like this...\nreminds me of this one time when I was little.[VAR 0114(0006)]
I’d seen it in a movie...\c\nthis man singing and dancing in the rain.\c\nIt captivated me so much that I had to try it\nfor myself.\c\nMy mother spotted me out in the rain, and she\nwas so shocked that she ran right out after me\r\nwithout even bothering to get an umbrella...[VAR 0114(0006)]
And then...she smiled...\nand she danced with me in the rain.\c\nOf course we both ended up catching cold.\c\nShe let me sleep in her big bed with her.\nI was so happy that I kept waking her again\r\nand again, just to be sure it wasn’t a dream...[VAR 0114(0006)]
But...\c\nthen she changed.\c\nAnd all she would think about was the\nUltra Beasts.\c\nAnd Null and Nebby...\c\nThey both ended up suffering so much...\nand I couldn’t do anything...[VAR 0114(0006)]
But you know what, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]?\c\nWhenever I feel like there’s nothing I can do,\nyou seem to show up and...you do something.\c\nEvery time, you’ve shown me that it’s possible...\nto do something.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Even the first time we met...\c\nNebby was being attacked, and all I could do\nwas look on in horror...[VAR 0114(0006)]
And at Aether Paradise...\c\nall I could do was wait for you and the\nothers to save me...[VAR 0114(0006)]
Whenever I’m in any sort of trouble, you’re\nalways there...[VAR 0114(0006)]
I...[VAR 0114(0006)]
Um...\n[VAR TRNAME(0000)]?\c\nWhat are you going to do...once you finish your\nisland challenge?[VAR 0114(0006)]
Fill my Pokédex
Get stronger
I don’t know
It must be nice, knowing what you want to do.\nI really admire that.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Oh, thank goodness...\c\nIt’s such a relief to know that even someone\nlike you feels unsure at times, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]![VAR 0114(0006)]
I think...I’d like to become a Trainer, too.\nAnd travel together with you, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]...[VAR 0114(0006)]
I want to become a Trainer, and learn all the\nthings you know, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]...[VAR 0114(0006)]
... ... ...\n... ... ...[VAR 0114(0006)]

A flute is placed on a very old pedestal...
Will you take the flute?
You obtained the Sun Flute!
You obtained the Moon Flute!
Now we have both the Sun Flute and the\nMoon Flute![VAR 0114(0006)]
I don’t know if it will really summon the\nLegendary Pokémon, but we can at least try!\c\nIf nothing else, we’ll have sounded the flutes in\noffering like people used to do.\c\nSo thank you for coming this far with me,\n[VAR TRNAME(0000)]![VAR 0114(0006)]
Let’s go meet the chief of the seafolk and\nget back to Poni Island![VAR 0114(0006)]

Look at you, trial-goer!\nYou going to the altar to play the flutes?\c\nThe altar lies all the way through the Vast Poni\nCanyon. It’s a long road there.\r\nThat path is like nature’s own trial.\c\nGood luck to you, friends.\c\nAnd why don’t you stop by and tell Hapu that\nyou’re off before you go!

You’re from Team Skull.\nWhat is it that you want from us?[VAR 0114(0006)]

We can make you talk, even if we have to cut\nyou to the bone![VAR 0114(0032)]
OK, so you cut me to the bone! Ouch![VAR 0114(0032)]
Doesn’t matter! We’ll come after you with all our\nPokémon at once then, li’l homeslice!\c\nWe’ll give 200 percent to save our boy Guzma![VAR 0114(0031)]
I’m not giving up, even though you beat me!\nI’m part of Team Skull! We’re thick as anything![VAR 0114(0031)]
That’s enough.\nNo one wants to see a sore loser.[VAR 0114(0018)]
Hmmph. You, girlie...\c\nLillie, right?[VAR 0114(0018)]
You really ready to do this finally?[VAR 0114(0018)]
To be honest, I’ve treated you really badly.\c\nEven if I was just doing the work the president\ntold me to do, I shouldn’t have done all that.\c\nEven if I apologize now, I know it’s probably too\nlate for you to forgive me, though.[VAR 0114(0018)]
See, Guzma...\c\nhe really likes the president.\c\nShe’s the only adult who ever seemed to see\nhow strong he was.[VAR 0114(0018)]
The president...\c\nMy mother is—\nShe’s selfish.\c\nShe lavishes her love only on those she deems\nworthy, not caring whether it is wanted or not.[VAR 0114(0006)]
But I will save her.\nI still have something I need to tell her.\c\nAnd I think I can save Guzma as well.[VAR 0114(0006)]
You know...deep down, you’re kind of like\nthe president.\c\nYou’ve gone in a different direction, but I can tell\nyou have the same strength in your convictions.[VAR 0114(0018)]
Bring Guzma back, if you can.\nI know you’ve got no reason to help...\c\nbut no one can make up for what they’ve done\nif they’re gone.[VAR 0114(0018)]
And you, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].\nLooks like you were special after all.\c\nYou didn’t just stand up to Team Skull.\nYou even took on the darkness inside Aether.\c\nLooks like you’re the real deal.\nThe realest Pokémon Trainer I’ve seen around.[VAR 0114(0018)]
Take good care of our little princess here.\c\nThis is my way of saying sorry, OK?\nTake it. It’s Poisonium Z.[VAR 0114(0018)]
Oh yeah...\c\nyou got your first stone directly from Tapu\nKoko, didn’t you, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]?\c\nYou’d better take care of it. \nThat’s one special Z-Ring you’ve got there.[VAR 0114(0018)]
A Trainer is only a Trainer because of the\nPokémon with them.\c\nIf you ever forget that, you’ll bring the wrath\nof the tapu down upon yourself.\c\nYou should be fine, though.[VAR 0114(0018)]
I’m out of here.[VAR 0114(0018)]
I suppose even Team Skull is not all bad...\c\nThanks for helping me again, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].\nAnd here, let me thank your team, too![VAR 0114(0006)]

Nothing wrong with that.\c\nPeople cannot survive all on their own.\nThey have got to help one another out.\c\nSame for Pokémon, too.\c\nThat is what my grandfather used to say.[VAR 0114(000B)]

Just so! It is my grand trial!\c\nI may be young, but that does not mean that I\nwill be outdone by any of those other kahunas!\c\nI am certain that my bonds with Mudsdale\nand the rest of my team are the\r\nclosest you will find anywhere in Alola![VAR 0114(000B)]
Do you want to try to take me and my Pokémon\non at our full strength?[VAR 0114(000B)]
Only if you’ll take on mine
I need to prepare first
Then I will wait.[VAR 0114(000B)]
I am Kahuna Hapu!\c\nAnd I have made the sparkling stone that the\ntapu entrusted me with into a Z-Ring of my own![VAR 0114(000B)]
Having a Z-Ring like we do, [VAR TRNAME(0000)],\nmeans that we battle with the tapu beside us.[VAR 0114(000B)]
This is the first grand trial of Kahuna Hapu!\c\nI will battle you with everything that I have got![VAR 0114(000B)]
Ahaha! Now, don’t be hasty, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\nLook at the state of your Pokémon.\c\nWe have got to have them in peak condition for\nthis to be a fair fight.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Oho...\nYou sure showed me.[VAR 0114(000B)]
That was enjoyable.\c\nLooks like I cannot beat you even when I am not\nholding back...\c\nI appreciate this chance, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].\nIt has really taught me a few things.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Take your Ground-type Z-Crystal then...\nThis Groundium Z is yours![VAR 0114(000B)]
I will teach you the pose, too, so eyes up here![VAR 0114(000B)]
Hyah![VAR 0114(000B)]
Phew...\c\nWell, I must applaud you, Lillie. You sure found\na prodigious Trainer to befriend.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Then go on with you two!\nHead straight through here and find the altar![VAR 0114(000B)]
The path to the shrine is through the canyon.\c\nYou will find other Trainers in this place, though.\nThey come for training. It will be a tough road.[VAR 0114(000B)]
You will have to pitch in, too, Lillie.\c\nBut if you two end up in any real trouble,\nMudsdale and I will hasten to you.[VAR 0114(000B)]
Thank you, Hapu. I’ll do my best![VAR 0114(0006)]
Come!\c\nIf you want to proceed to that canyon, you will\nhave to get through me and my grand trial![VAR 0114(000B)]

The vast canyon...\nI wonder what we will find ahead.[VAR 0114(0006)]
And what a mysterious statue...\nDo you think it means something?[VAR 0114(0006)]
Oh, yes! [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\nHere, take this.[VAR 0114(0006)]
It’s a Max Revive I found in Aether Paradise.[VAR 0114(0006)]
When I—\c\nOnce I am ready, I am going to come after you,\n[VAR TRNAME(0000)]. I am going to catch up to you.\c\nAnd when I do, I’m going to become strong\nenough to save my mother and Nebby, too![VAR 0114(0006)]
Oh, yes...\nBut let me first make sure that [VAR PKNAME(0001)]\r\n[VAR NUMBRNCH(00FD,1D06)]is alland the rest of your team are ready for battle![VAR 0114(0006)]
Being together with your favorite Pokémon is\neven better when they’re all feeling their best![VAR 0114(0006)]

Phew...\nThis canyon truly is a difficult path to walk.\c\nAnd you even make the Vast Poni Canyon seem\nlike nothing at all, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]![VAR 0114(0006)]
But you know what?\c\nI’ve overcome my fears enough to cross even\na high bridge like this one![VAR 0114(0006)]
I am not going to be afraid of heights anymore.\c\nNext time I should even be able to tackle that\nbridge on Mahalo Trail![VAR 0114(0006)]
Watch this!\nThis is my trial![VAR 0114(0006)]
Oh...[VAR 0114(0006)]
[VAR TRNAME(0000)]! I did it!\nI made it all the way across!\c\nI’ve cleared my trial![VAR 0114(0006)]
I completed my first trial!\nAmazing, right, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0006)]
Yeah!
It was all right
Hee hee![VAR 0114(0006)]
Oh, you spoilsport![VAR 0114(0006)]
But it’s really thanks to you, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]...\nYou’re the reason why I’ve come so far!\c\nStill...I think I’ll take a little rest here.\c\nI’m afraid my legs are still shaking![VAR 0114(0006)]
[VAR PKNAME(0001)], do you want a rest, too?[VAR 0114(0006)]
Don’t worry. I’ve got you covered!\c\nI have Hyper Potions and Revives and even\nlots of Ethers, too.\c\nThough I’m not sure I brought enough Max\nRepels for a path like this one...[VAR 0114(0006)]

It looks like we’re nearly to the altar now,\naren’t we, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]...\c\nLet me take care of [VAR PKNAME(0001)] for you.[VAR 0114(0006)]
When your Pokémon are full of energy, then a\nTrainer can go anywhere in the world...\r\nDoesn’t it seem that way?[VAR 0114(0006)]
I’m just...going to rest a moment.\c\nPhew. Looks like I still have enough Max Repels.[VAR 0114(0006)]

Oh! Now that’s a great composition!\c\nI could paint a picture of you—the visitor\nto Poni![VAR 0114(0030)]
Guess I didn’t introduce myself though.\nI’m Mina. I’m the captain.[VAR 0114(0012)]
I mean, I sort of am.\c\nI actually just wander around doing my art,\nso I don’t have an actual trial or anything...[VAR 0114(0012)]
But Vast Poni Canyon sure is a wonder, huh?[VAR 0114(0012)]
Once you’ve been through this place, you can\nreally get to understand why that Ilima boy\r\ndesigned his trial the way he did, right?[VAR 0114(0012)]
Oh, yeah. Ohhhh, yeah.\nHere. Take this as a token of our acquaintance.[VAR 0114(0012)]
It’s the Fairium Z.\nGet your Z on![VAR 0114(0012)]
I’m the captain and all, so I’ve gotta come up\nwith a trial.\c\nMaybe it could involve painting pictures and\npicking flowers...\r\nMaybe a trial like that could be cool?[VAR 0114(0012)]

You did a fine job clearing it, just as expected,\n[VAR TRNAME(0000)]![VAR 0114(000B)]
You’ve cleared all seven trials of Alola’s\nisland challenge now! That’s wonderful!\c\nYou’ve pushed yourself beyond your limits\nand really become a great Trainer, haven’t you?\c\nAnd [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0100)]she could never have done it without you,\n[VAR PKNAME(0001)]! Let me heal you up real quick![VAR 0114(0006)]
Look at the two of you.\nI think this might just work out.[VAR 0114(000B)]
No, I am quite sure of it![VAR 0114(000B)]

So, boy.\c\nI hope you can bother yourself to come along to\nthe base of Ula’ula Island’s Mount Lanakila.\c\nYou remember Tapu Village, don’t you?\nWhere the folks were doing construction work?\c\nHe’ll be ready and waiting for you there.[VAR 0114(000A)]
So, girl.\c\nI hope you can bother yourself to come along to\nthe base of Ula’ula Island’s Mount Lanakila.\c\nYou remember Tapu Village, don’t you?\nWhere the folks were doing construction work?\c\nHe’ll be ready and waiting for you there.[VAR 0114(000A)]
I suppose I could take you along with me...\nYou want to do that? Come now, with me?[VAR 0114(000A)]
Looks like we’re on this journey together, then.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Not many kids make it all the way to the final\ntrial, but there’s a handful every year.\c\nYou won’t be able to go easy on this one.\nThese are real battles. No holding back.[VAR 0114(000A)]

I’ve been waiting for you.\c\nTo thank you.\c\nFor what you did for Lillie. For our mother.\c\nI appreciate it.\nMaybe more than you know.[VAR 0114(0013)]
And the only thing I can offer you in thanks\nis a great battle.\c\nSo I’m going to show my full power...\nMy real full power this time!\r\nWith the Z-Ring that old man gave me![VAR 0114(0013)]
You’ve got [VAR NUMBRNCH(00FD,0002)]a good Pokémon.\c\nI know what kind of Trainer you are now.\nAnd what kind of journey you’ve been through.[VAR 0114(0013)]
I know why you of all people could save Lillie.\nWhy you could save Cosmog...and Alola.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Lillie wanted me to tell you something.\nShe’s looking after our mother at the foundation.[VAR 0114(0013)]
She wanted me to tell you...that you’re the best\nPokémon Trainer in the world, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].[VAR 0114(0013)]
She gave me this. For you.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Hau’s working hard to get stronger, too.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Hmph...\c\nIf you two are going to get even stronger, then\nI guess I can’t let down my guard yet.[VAR 0114(0013)]
I know we aren’t friends.\c\nBut we aren’t enemies anymore either.\c\nKeep winning. Maybe I’ll see you again if you do.[VAR 0114(0013)]

[VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\nHold up for me![VAR 0114(0007)]
So after we split up at Aether Paradise, I went\nand cleared all the rest of my trials, and then\r\nI even went back home to train with Ilima a bit.[VAR 0114(0007)]
I was just thinking it was time to take on the\nPokémon League...\c\nThen I heard from Gladion that you were already\nheading here, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\c\nSo I booked it here as fast as I could![VAR 0114(0007)]
That was, like, the fastest I’ve ever moved in\nmy life, you know![VAR 0114(0007)]
But that’s not what I came here to tell you![VAR 0114(0007)]
[VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\nWe’re gonna decide which one of us’ll be the\r\nfirst to the Pokémon League!\c\nYou’re gonna need to use your full force if you\nthink you’re gonna beat me and my team when\r\nwe’re serious about winning![VAR 0114(0007)]
Ooooh, and I really wanted my Pokémon to know\nhow it feels to beat your team this time!\c\nBut being seriously frustrated will only make\nme stronger![VAR 0114(0007)]
So you’d better go and become Champion.\c\n’Cause I’m gonna train so that next time I can\ncome beat Champion [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\r\nGood luck, cuz, and here![VAR 0114(0007)]

Thanks!
Aren’t you cold?
I can’t help but remember when you first chose\nyour partner, yeah...[VAR 0114(0005)]
Naw, I’m fine! My soul burns hot, yeah—hotter\nthan a Blast Burn even![VAR 0114(0005)]
Just one thing left for you to do—\ntake on the Pokémon League!\r\nThis is where the real fun starts![VAR 0114(0005)]
Hey now! Looks like you got the Legendary\nPokémon Solgaleo on your side![VAR 0114(0005)]
There’s something I hope that Legendary\nPokémon knows:\c\nThis has always been the spot where we finish\nup the island challenge.\c\nWe wanted to put our Pokémon League right up\nhere, as close as we could get to the sun...\r\nto respect and honor you, Solgaleo![VAR 0114(0005)]

I still remember it like it was yesterday!\c\nI went all the way to Indigo Plateau, yeah, right\nto the Pokémon League headquarters...\r\nand I went right at them, cousin![VAR 0114(0005)]
Those Gym Leaders in Kanto really messed my\nteam and me up!\c\nBut then I saw my team battling for me through\nit all, pouring their souls into their moves for me.[VAR 0114(0005)]
And then that last guy, that Dragon user in\nthe cape...[VAR 0114(0005)]
Oh sorry! Enough about me—let’s get you in\nthere, yeah![VAR 0114(0005)]

Four Trainers![VAR 0114(0005)]
Every Pokémon League in every region all over\nthe world features four fantastic Trainers called\r\nthe Elite Four.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Here in Alola, too, we’ve got four Trainers all\nlined up for our Pokémon League.[VAR 0114(0005)]
You’ll win your way past every last one of\nthem. You can’t leave until you do...\r\nor until you give up.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Sounds good!
Sounds...tough
[VAR PKNAME(0001)] can sense when its Trainer\nis nervous.\c\nStay loose! You’ll be fine![VAR 0114(0005)]
What’re you talking about?\c\nYou’re a great Trainer in your own right, plus\nyou’ve got [VAR PKNAME(0001)] on your side![VAR 0114(0005)]
I expect you to show me some intense moves\nand real heart-stopping battles in there!\r\nGood luck, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]! [VAR PKNAME(0001)]![VAR 0114(0005)]

Your old kahuna is now also a member\nof the Elite Four.\c\nWell, this time I’m holding nothing back! Time for\nyou to see what I can really do![VAR 0114(0008)]
It is only when the balance of the\nold and the new is just right that you can\r\ncreate something truly original.\c\nThat is what I saw in the battle between us.\nAn elder’s experience and the fire of youth![VAR 0114(0008)]
Welcome, Champion, to the Pokémon League,\nwhere strength is everything!\c\nNow, with love in our hearts, let us clash in\nPokémon battle![VAR 0114(0008)]
A heart-pounding battle like that always sends\na shiver through my whole body! I’m sure my\r\nPokémon felt it, too![VAR 0114(0008)]
Oh ho ho! So it’s me who faced you first.\c\nDefeating the Elite Four will become a fine\npart of our island challenge![VAR 0114(0008)]
Oh ho ho! So I was the second to face you?\c\nSome people would say you’re halfway there,\nwhile some may say you’ve still got halfway\r\nto go. How you see it is up to you.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Oh ho ho! So I was the third to face you?\c\nIf you’ll take a bit of advice from this old man,\nI wouldn’t let my guard down yet if I were you.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Oh ho ho! So I was the last to face you?\c\nBut then who do you think awaits you in the\nChampion’s chamber?[VAR 0114(0008)]

Welcome to the Rock Chamber!
No introduction needed here.\nTime to battle me, Olivia![VAR 0114(0009)]
I don’t see the same look in your eyes that I saw\nwhen we first met on Akala Island.\c\nHave you had some experiences that you’ll\ncarry with you in your heart forever?\c\nWell, it’s time for you to move on.[VAR 0114(0009)]
I won’t be holding back!\c\nMy Rock-type Pokémon will grind you to dust!\c\nYour puny little Pokémon are going to go\ndown in one hit! Hah![VAR 0114(0009)]
What a spectacular Trainer you are!\c\nNow when the children of Alola finish their\nisland challenge, they can visit the Pokémon\r\nLeague to try to become the Champion!\c\nThe Trainers of Alola will become even stronger![VAR 0114(0009)]
You should get moving. You still have three\nmore rooms left, right?[VAR 0114(0009)]
Don’t stop now. You still have two more\nrooms left, right?[VAR 0114(0009)]
I’ll stay here and wonder why you left me\nwaiting so long for your challenge...[VAR 0114(0009)]

Hiya! Acerola here, bringing an old royal touch\nto the Pokémon League!
Nanu said maybe he can’t refuse a tapu\nchoosing him to serve as kahuna...\c\nBut he’d be darned if he had to serve as one of\nthe Elite Four just because some guy asked him!\c\nSo I guess I’ll just have to battle hard enough\nto make up for his not being here![VAR 0114(0011)]
Phew!\c\nWell, there goes my hope of beating you to\nsmithereens and becoming Champion myself![VAR 0114(0011)]
Hey, even if you are the Champion, you can’t\ngo into the Champion’s chamber without\r\nproving you can still get past the Elite Four!\c\nAnd besides...battling is just plain fun!\nCome on, I can take you![VAR 0114(0011)]
Being in the Elite Four is fun, but so is being a\ncaptain...\r\nHmm, I’m not sure which to do...[VAR 0114(0011)]
You’ve got three more Trainers to take on!\c\nThanks for picking me to battle first, while you\nwere still fresh and full of energy![VAR 0114(0011)]
You have two more Trainers to take on!\c\nAre you getting tired? If you are, and you still\nare beating us, then I guess we’ve got quite\r\na bit farther to go ourselves![VAR 0114(0011)]
You’ve made it to third base!\nNow you’ve just got to bring it home!\r\nOr would this be second base?\r\nI don’t really get baseball metaphors...[VAR 0114(0011)]
You’ve blasted right through the Elite Four!\nWell, first off, let me say congratulations!\c\nBut don’t lose your momentum now!\nJust keep storming ahead![VAR 0114(0011)]

So, here you are...\c\nWhy don’t we see who the winds favor today,\nyou...or me?
My name is Kahili.\c\nA few years ago, I was a champion of the island\nchallenge, too. Just like you.\c\nI’ve been traveling the world to improve my skill\nas both a Trainer and as a golfer.\c\nWhen I heard that they’d made a Pokémon\nLeague in my own home region, I came flying\r\nback to serve Alola.\c\nHave a look at my fantastic Flying-type team![VAR 0114(0019)]
You know...I think you’ll bring a breath of fresh\nair to the Alola battle scene.\c\nI was honestly annoyed when Kukui kept\npestering me to come here, but I’m glad I did.[VAR 0114(0019)]
So, you came to battle me again!\c\nIf I beat you, the number one ranked Trainer in\nAlola, then I’ll be ready to take on the world!\c\nI’m coming for you, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]![VAR 0114(0019)]
That battle was worthy of being number one\nin Alola...\c\nMaybe even number one in the world!\nBut next time, I’ll win. You’ll see![VAR 0114(0019)]
There are three more members of the Elite Four.\c\nAnd every one of them is a top-class Trainer.[VAR 0114(0019)]
There are two more members of the Elite Four...\c\nAnd I wouldn’t be surprised if you have a hard\ntime deciding which one to take on next.[VAR 0114(0019)]
There is just one member of the Elite Four left.\c\nI hope you enjoy the transcendent kind of battle\nyou only find at the top of the Pokémon League![VAR 0114(0019)]
Do you wonder what lies beyond the Elite Four?\c\nGo. See with your own eyes what awaits you.[VAR 0114(0019)]

And of course that Trainer is me. Woo![VAR 0114(0005)]
One final hurrah for your island challenge.\c\nAnd a special tribute as you and this\nPokémon League embark on a new path!\r\nLet’s have a battle worthy of this moment![VAR 0114(0005)]
Amazing!\c\nIt’s like I told you before, the strongest moves\nyou can use are the ones a Trainer and their\r\nPokémon choose together in the heat of the\r\nmoment—when it really counts.\c\nAnd you just proved me right! Congrats, cousin.\nYou’re a Champion we can all be proud of.[VAR 0114(0005)]
I told you, didn’t I? Up there on Mount Hokulani.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Man, the Pokémon and the Trainers in Alola\nreally are the best!\c\nI want everyone in the world to know that, too!\nThat’s always been my dream![VAR 0114(0005)]
And right here, right now, it finally came true!\c\nAnd it’s all thanks to you, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\nYou and your [VAR PKNAME(0001)]![VAR 0114(0005)]

You really do love your Pokémon with all your\nheart, don’t you, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0011)]
Yup! That’s precisely why [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0100)]she and h[VAR GENDBR(00FF,0202)]iser Pokémon\nwere able to combine that strength to\r\nemerge victorious![VAR 0114(0009)]

Hey, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]...\c\nIt looks like the party is going to keep on going\nstrong for some time still, wouldn’t you say?\c\nDo you think...maybe...we could sneak out for\na second and visit the Ruins of Conflict?\c\nI heard from Kahuna Hala that the bridge\nhas been fixed.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Sure!
What about the festival?
I think Tapu Koko must be waiting...\c\nI’m sure it’s waiting for you to come to it,\n[VAR TRNAME(0000)]...\c\nnow that you finished your island challenge.[VAR 0114(0006)]

But thinking back on it now...\c\nit really was Lunala...\c\nI mean it was Nebby who brought the two of us\ntogether, wasn’t it, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0006)]

[VAR TRNAME(0000)]! Honestly!\c\nIt’s time you showed Tapu Koko your gratitude.\nDo it through one of the battles that it so loves.[VAR 0114(0006)]
You reached out and touched the statue...
You seem to hear a voice ringing in your head...\nas though it’s coming from your Z-Ring...?
GOOD...SOLGALEO...
GOOD...LUNALA...
IT IS TIME...
Tapu ko-ko-ko-kooo!!!
Tapu Koko disappeared...
A Z-Crystal clattered to the floor at your feet...
There is no reaction from the statue...
Tapu Koko... It may have lost that battle to you,\nbut I don’t think it was sad about that.\c\nI’m sure that the two of you will meet in battle\nagain someday![VAR 0114(0006)]
Tapu Koko...\c\nI know it will aspire to ever greater heights at\nyour side from now on, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]![VAR 0114(0006)]
So you’ll challenge Tapu Koko another day...\c\nI suppose Trainers must know how to judge the\nstrength of their opponents and must also\r\nunderstand their own limits.[VAR 0114(0006)]
The great Tapu Koko...\nIt really is fantastically strong, isn’t it!\r\nNo wonder it is the guardian of all Akala![VAR 0114(0006)]
But I’m so glad we could come here.\nIt had been weighing on my heart...[VAR 0114(0006)]
Come on, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].\nWe should get back to the village.\c\nIf we don’t return soon, everyone will realize\nthat we slipped away from the festival![VAR 0114(0006)]

It’s a beautiful festival, isn’t it...\nEveryone looks so happy.[VAR 0114(0006)]
I hope that you’ll always stay just the way\nyou are now, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]...\c\nLook how your joy has brought so much light\nto everyone here...[VAR 0114(0006)]
I think even my mother would have smiled and\nlaughed to see this...if she could have come...[VAR 0114(0006)]
I think...my mother is getting a bit better.\nShe even tried to come tonight...[VAR 0114(0006)]
I’ve been trying to help her understand what\nshe did wrong. Gently, of course.\r\nBut she needed someone to scold her.[VAR 0114(0006)]
But in the process I think I’ve discovered what\nI have to do next.\r\nWhat it is that I can do.[VAR 0114(0006)]
[VAR TRNAME(0000)]...\nI...I am going to—[VAR 0114(0006)]

Was that the doorbell?\c\nOh, that’s got to be Kukui.\nWhy don’t you let him in, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0004)]

Looks like you slept well, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].[VAR 0114(0004)]
A-lo-la![VAR 0114(0007)]
The salty breeze sang to me and brought me\nhere to you![VAR 0114(0007)]
Oooh! And there’s that Kantonian Meowth!\nLook at that shiny coin on your head, kitty-kitty![VAR 0114(0007)]
Mrowr?
I finally got my gramps to go all out and be\nserious in a battle against me!\c\nI got some sweet rewards, so take this one,\n[VAR TRNAME(0000)]! Good luck is best shared![VAR 0114(0007)]
You obtained a Z-Crystal for Decidueye.\nThe Decidium Z is yours!
You obtained a Z-Crystal for Incineroar.\nThe Incinium Z is yours!
You obtained a Z-Crystal for Primarina.\nThe Primarium Z is yours!
Now you can power up, too, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]![VAR 0114(0007)]
That’s so nice of you, Hau. Thank you![VAR 0114(0004)]
Naw! No problem, auntie!\c\nSay. Is Kanto, like, really far way?[VAR 0114(0007)]
It’s pretty close
It’s pretty far
Yes, I’d say it’s pretty close.\nClose enough to visit whenever you want to![VAR 0114(0004)]
Well...\nit’s true that it’s not the next island or anything.\c\nBut it’s still close enough to visit whenever you\nwant to![VAR 0114(0004)]
All right! Then it’s decided!\c\nI’m gonna get stronger and stronger, and then\nI’m gonna travel the world with my Pokémon!\c\nI’m gonna go find Lillie!\nAnd my dad, too![VAR 0114(0007)]
Your father?[VAR 0114(0004)]
Oh, yeah, him. Heh...\c\nHe’s a strong Trainer—real strong, I think.\nBut I guess he really hated being the son of\r\na kahuna and everything, yeah?\r\nSo he works far away from Alola these days.[VAR 0114(0007)]
I think I’m gonna go train myself up at the\nBattle Tree, then beat you, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]...\r\nand I’ll be a Champion next time I see him!\r\nSeems like a nice little present, eh? Hehe![VAR 0114(0007)]
What is a Battle Tree, Hau?[VAR 0114(0004)]
Oh, it’s this thing way deep on Poni Island!\c\nAnybody who has passed the island challenge—\nor who is strong enough to, anyway—can battle\r\nit out with their Pokémon! Or so they say.[VAR 0114(0007)]
[VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\c\nLet’s have the best ever battle at that Pokémon\nLeague sometime. No backing out![VAR 0114(0007)]
That’s right...\c\nNow that you’re the current Champion,\neveryone is going to want to challenge you![VAR 0114(0004)]

You know, Lillie...\nKanto is a long way away from here.\r\nTry not to let the jet lag hit you too hard.[VAR 0114(0005)]
Burnet’s...well...\c\nshe said she’d be too sad to watch you go,\nso she wouldn’t even come out with me.\c\nI know it’s a lot to ask, but forgive her this\ntime, wouldja?\c\nShe did tell me to let you know the loft in the\nlab is yours to use indefinitely.[VAR 0114(0005)]
So you can come back and stay whenever you\nlike, Lillie![VAR 0114(0005)]
You didn’t tell us![VAR 0114(0007)]
Hau...\nI’m sorry...\c\nBut I’ve decided. I have to go to Kanto.\c\nTo help my mother get better...\nbut more than that...to help myself get stronger.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Of course I’m sad to leave Alola...[VAR 0114(0006)]
but...the thought of going to Kanto also fills\nmy heart with excitement![VAR 0114(0006)]
I’m going to become a real Trainer and meet all\nkinds of wonderful Pokémon...\c\nI’m going to travel all around Kanto, just like we\ndid here on Alola for your island challenges![VAR 0114(0006)]
And no matter what happens on my journey...\nI’m going to be OK.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Because of the smiles that you shared with me.\nYou and [VAR TRNAME(0000)] and everyone here...\r\nthank you all so much![VAR 0114(0006)]
And that’s why someday...\nsomeday I’ll come back to Alola again![VAR 0114(0006)]
But...but...I haven’t gotten to say any of the\nthings that I wanted to say to you!\c\nSo...so... Arghhh!!\c\nI’m gonna send you a letter!\nA really, really long one! You’d better wait![VAR 0114(0007)]
I will, Hau.\nAnd please...take this.[VAR 0114(0006)]
[VAR TRNAME(0000)]...\c\nit may look a little worn, but...that is because\nthis was my most treasured belonging once.[VAR 0114(0006)]

[VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\nI’ve made it this far, too!\c\nBut I’m not done yet.\nAfter all, there’s still a Trainer standing right in\r\nfront of me that I’ve got to overcome![VAR 0114(0007)]
Seriously! This is really frustrating, you know?\nI seriously tried my hardest, you know?\c\nBut at least I had a blast going all out against\nyou, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].\r\nSo thanks.[VAR 0114(0007)]
The funnest thing in the world has got to be\nto battle all out, you know? Seriously!\c\nSo watch out, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\n’Cause me and my awesome team are definitely\r\nwinning this one![VAR 0114(0007)]
I was finally able to beat my gramps when he\nwas going all out, you know?\c\nNow I’m not giving up until I can beat Alola’s\nstrongest Champion, too!\r\nYeah, I’m looking at you, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]![VAR 0114(0007)]
Phew! It is difficult, triumphing over all the\nElite Four in a row.\c\nHowever, defeating the Champion will\nsurely be even more challenging.[VAR 0114(000B)]
We do our utmost as kahunas, always striving\nonward to make a tale worthy of our history.\c\nLooks like you are going to make a fine tale for\nyourself, Champion![VAR 0114(000B)]
If I am serious about my role as a kahuna, then\ntaking on the Champion seems fitting![VAR 0114(000B)]
We kahunas are chosen by Pokémon.\nAnd the Champion is chosen by the people.\c\nIt brings me some joy to see this new age\ncoming to Alola.[VAR 0114(000B)]
What does a Pokémon Trainer really need to be\nsuccessful?\c\nI guess everyone might have their own answer.\nBut for me...\r\nI want the strongest rival for myself.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Losing can teach you a lot, you know.\nI learn a lot from it...\r\nLosing just helps you see how to get stronger.\c\nSo I’m glad we did this.\nThat I had a Champion to help me get stronger.[VAR 0114(0013)]
You just use your best moves and see who is\nleft standing at the end, right?[VAR 0114(0013)]
Phew... I’ll be back again.\nYou can count on that, Champion![VAR 0114(0013)]
Champion... Now that is a title that everyone\nin Alola would bow before!\c\nI’m already a champion when it comes to power\nand prestige, after all...\r\nTaking this title would be my just deserts![VAR 0114(0015)]
I admit you have potential...\c\nYou have proved to me that my judgment of\nyou when we first met was flawless, as usual.\c\nYou are a worthy Champion![VAR 0114(0015)]
As long as you claim that title, I will keep\nclawing my way here to you!\c\nThat’s right! I’m here to relieve you of the\ntitle of Pokémon League Champion![VAR 0114(0015)]
You wait...\nSomeday I will claw my way back up here again...\c\nbut I suppose I should congratulate you first!\c\nSee how bighearted I am to praise my opponent![VAR 0114(0015)]
The name’s Ryuki. I’m what you might call a star.\c\nI mean, with partners like my Pokémon, how\ncould I not be a star?\c\nI came all the way across the sea here to Alola\nto spread my fame out here, too! The whole\r\nworld will be mine soon![VAR 0114(001A)]
Everyone’s got their own problems, huh?\c\nThe critics loved my songs, but nobody was\nbuying my music for a while, man.\c\nBut I’m just a rocker down to my bones.\nNothing else to do but keep on rocking.\c\nI dig you, Champ. Looks like you know who\nyou are, too, right down to your bones.[VAR 0114(001A)]
My babies here are dying to play a set.\nI figure what better stage than the Champion’s!\c\nAllow me to introduce my bandmates!\nCome on, babies![VAR 0114(001A)]
Oooh, that Champion’s strength!\nI feel the flames of jealousy burning in my heart!\c\nBut passing through the fire makes me stronger,\nand that’s why I’m a star!\c\nI’ll roll into town again sometime, Champ.\nI’m always looking for a good gig.[VAR 0114(001A)]
I came to keep my word about us having a\nbattle next time, as I said after my trial\r\nat the Observatory.[VAR 0114(0010)]
You’re great, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\c\nYou understand Pokémon so well and know so\nmuch about Pokémon battles.\c\nI see that thinking up this and that to try to\ndefeat the Champion is the highest form of fun![VAR 0114(0010)]
Playing games with Big Mo...\c\nMaintaining Festival Plaza...\c\nChecking the anime I’ve recorded...\c\nThey’re all fun but not the same as a battle with\nyou, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].\c\nI worked out a plan with Ilima against you, \n[VAR TRNAME(0000)], to try to win.[VAR 0114(0010)]
You’re way too strong, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]...\c\n“Ping Totem Pokémon 2.0” is \nrunning smoothly, so next I’m thinking that\c\nI should put together Sophocles’s\nenhanced program.[VAR 0114(0010)]
I came to check on what Kukui has built, and...\nthe Pokémon League is fantastic!\c\nIt’s a place that conveys the awesomeness of\nAlola to the world.\c\nAnd in that case, I guess that what’s important\nis what kind of Trainer the Champion is.[VAR 0114(001C)]
Just as I’d expect from an acquaintance\nof Kukui’s!\c\nI too am proud that you are the strongest\nPokémon Trainer in Alola!\c\nI’ll try to come hang out again.\c\nPokémon battles with you are more fun than\nany game![VAR 0114(001C)]
I gave the captain position to my cousin\nSophocles, but I’m confident in my ability.\c\nMy strength is like that of a supernova![VAR 0114(001C)]
Just as I’d expect from the Champion!\c\nIn every situation, you pick the best moves\nand items.\c\nSo I too have to rack my brain in the battle...\nAt some point I want to have a battle with\r\nSophocles and me as a duo versus you and\r\nKukui for all the marbles. Or I guess a\r\nBattle Royal?[VAR 0114(001C)]
I don’t really wanna be the Champion of the\nPokémon League I made myself, but there’s\r\nnothing wrong with wanting to take on the\r\nbiggest and baddest Trainer there is, right?\c\nAfter all, I do love my research![VAR 0114(0005)]
Whoa! Well, I always knew it would be a\ncrushing defeat.\c\nI’m still glad I got to battle you, Champ. And I’m\nas thankful as I could be that I met you and\r\nyour Pokémon![VAR 0114(0005)]
All right, [VAR TRNAME(0000)], I’m coming at you \nwith all my might. Woo![VAR 0114(0005)]
Whoa! Well, I always knew it would be a\ncrushing defeat.\c\nI’m still glad I got to battle you, Champ. And I’m\nas thankful as I could be that I met you and\r\nyour Pokémon![VAR 0114(0005)]
Those old dudes Molayne and Nanu somehow\ntalked me into doing this.\c\nI’m starting from scratch as a Pokémon Trainer\nand doing it right this time.\c\nI’ve got a Z-Ring and everything, so I might\nactually be able to live up to their expectations.[VAR 0114(0018)]
Even when I give it my all, I’m nothing compared\nto you!\c\nMaybe my Pokémon and I need to go through\nmore together to deepen our friendship.\c\nI’m out of here, Champ.[VAR 0114(0018)]
My team and I are battling for all the Pokémon\nwe took out on our way here![VAR 0114(0018)]
I failed again...like I always do. I promised\nmyself I wouldn’t! I told myself I would never\r\nfail again!\c\nIt’s all right to feel a little jealous, right?\nHow else am I supposed to get stronger?\c\nMy team and I really did take out so many\nPokémon to make it here![VAR 0114(0018)]
Hey, Champion!\nYou’ve gotta recommend a move for me!
I trained as much as I could on Route 1...\c\nI went through the whole island challenge to\nget here...\c\nand still!\nMan, the Champion really is something!
Champion! I’m gonna serve you up a brutal\nhelping of my Pokémon’s best moves!
Well, at least I know you’ll never beat me in how\nmuch we each love our Pokémon, Champion!

Hmmm. [VAR PKNICK(0000)], is it?\c\nYou picked quite a fine nickname.\c\nBut I think we could give it something even\nbetter. What do you say?
I see! What would you like the new nickname\nto be?\c
Done! From now on, this Pokémon shall be\nknown as [VAR PKNICK(0000)]!\c\nYou’re right, that does seem to fit it better.\nNicely done!
OK! Come see me again if you change\nyour mind.
Done! From now on, this Pokémon shall be\nknown as [VAR PKNICK(0000)]!\c\nIt looks no different from before, but we both\nknow this name is vastly superior!\r\nHow fortunate for you!
Hmmm. [VAR PKNICK(0000)]!\nThat is a truly impeccable nickname!\r\nI can’t say anything bad about it!\c\nTake good care of [VAR PKNICK(0000)]!

Or do you want to quit giving the Pokémon a\nnickname and change back to the name that\r\nthe Pokémon had when you two met?

Which Pokémon would that be?
Just remember me when there’s something you\nwant to forget!
What’s that, friend?\nThat Pokémon only knows one move, you know?
What’s this, friend?\nEggs don’t know any moves before they hatch.
Mm-hmm...\nAnd which move should it forget?

I understand... Moves that are too strong\ncan be difficult to use.
This Pokémon could learn this move, but\nthere is one condition that needs to be met.\c\nThat is...the Pokémon has to be completely\nfriendly toward you.\c\nI can teach the move only after the Pokémon\nbecomes totally bonded with you.
None of the Pokémon you are with right now can\nlearn this move...\c\nPlease come back when you obtain a Pokémon\nthat can learn this move!

Oh, this Pokémon can’t learn this move.
Oh, this is an Egg.\nI can’t teach the move to an Egg.

I’m devoting what’s left of my life to helping\nyoung Trainers grow.\c\nI’d like to teach the ultimate moves to\nas many successors as I can.\c\nIs it all right to teach them to your\nPokémon, too?
Would it be all right if I taught your Pokémon the\nultimate moves?
Young Trainer, the Pokémon with you can’t\nlearn these moves.\c\nPlease thoroughly check the list of Pokémon\nthat can learn these moves.
Young Trainer, feel free to come visit me\nanytime you want.
Well, please tell me which Pokémon I\nshould teach.
Young Trainer, that Pokémon can’t learn an\nultimate move.\c\nPlease thoroughly check the list of Pokémon\nthat can learn these moves.
Young Trainer, I can’t teach a move to\nan Egg.
Young Trainer, that Pokémon’s bond with\nyou is not yet strong enough.\c\nIt can learn the move once it forms a strong\nbond with you.
Young Trainer, that Pokémon already knows\nthe ultimate move.
Is it all right to teach [VAR MOVE(0001)]\nto [VAR PKNAME(0000)]?
Pokémon that can learn the ultimate\nmoves...\c\nThe blazing Fire-type Pokémon:\nCharizard, Typhlosion, Blaziken, Infernape,\nEmboar, Delphox, and Incineroar!\c\nThe restless Water-type Pokémon:\nBlastoise, Feraligatr, Swampert, Empoleon,\nSamurott, Greninja, and Primarina!\c\nThe quiet Grass-type Pokémon:\nVenusaur, Meganium, Sceptile, Torterra,\nSerperior, Chesnaught, and Decidueye!\n

Good morning! Welcome to the Pokémon Center.\nWould you like to rest your Pokémon?
Hello, and welcome to the Pokémon Center.\nWould you like to rest your Pokémon?
Welcome to the Pokémon Center. You’re up late!\nWould you like to rest your Pokémon?
I’ll take your Pokémon for a few seconds, then.
Thank you for waiting!\nWe’ve restored your Pokémon to full health.
We hope to see you again!
Happy birthday!\c\nI hope you’ll keep visiting the Pokémon Center\nfor many years to come!\c\nNow, would you like to rest your Pokémon?
Oh... It looks like your Pokémon may be infected\nwith the Pokérus.\c\nLittle is known about the Pokérus, except that\nit is a microscopic life-form that attaches itself\r\nto Pokémon.\c\nWhile infected, Pokémon are said to grow\nexceptionally well.
Happy birthday, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!
I do hope this will be a wonderful year for you,\n[VAR TRNAME(0000)]. Each and every day!
Oh, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\nToday is a special day!\c\nI know it’s a day early, but happy birthday!
First, let’s restore your Pokémon to full health.
Please visit a Pokémon Center whenever your\nPokémon’s HP is getting low.\c\nAnd if you’re planning to go far off the beaten\npath, you should probably remember to stock\r\nup on Potions from the Poké Mart, too.\c\nGood luck out there, Trainer!
There! All happy and healthy!\nGood luck and take care!
Welcome home, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\c\nLooks like that could’ve gone better, hmm?\nWell, get some rest before you head out again.\c\n...[VAR 0114(0004)]
That’s more like it! Now you and your Pokémon\nare both bursting with energy!\c\nBut, you know...when your Pokémon run out of\nenergy and their HP starts getting too low...\c\nWell, it’s just common sense for a Trainer to\ngo back home and let them recover. OK?\c\nNow get out there and have some fun![VAR 0114(0004)]

Go on and choose how many of your Poké Beans\nyou’d like to put into the Poké Bean crate.[VAR 0114(002F)]
The Pokémon will be delighted to see them![VAR 0114(002F)]
There are still some Poké Beans from last time.\nWait till they’re all gone, then you can add more.[VAR 0114(002F)]
It’s best to put some Poké Beans out when\nthere are Pokémon around to enjoy them![VAR 0114(002F)]
Did you want to do something?[VAR 0114(002F)]
You’ve already sent out one bottle today.\nThe limit is just one a day! Fair’s fair![VAR 0114(002F)]
Then I’ll put seven of your Plain Beans into a\nBean Bottle and set it adrift. That OK with you?[VAR 0114(002F)]
You don’t have the Poké Beans for that!\c\nBut that’s an easy enough problem to solve.\nJust pick some up on Isle Abeens![VAR 0114(002F)]
Mm-hmm! There we go![VAR 0114(002F)]
I’ve sent the Bean Bottle bobbing out in the sea!\nI hope it’ll catch us some nice luck today![VAR 0114(002F)]
I’m afraid you haven’t got enough Pokémon in\nyour Boxes yet for me to develop that isle.[VAR 0114(002F)]
Looks like you don’t have enough Plain Beans\nyet for me to develop that isle, my [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0403)]boygirl![VAR 0114(002F)]
Order received!\nThen I’ll get straight to work![VAR 0114(002F)]
[~ 13]
Yeah, I think we could do that![VAR 0114(002F)]
Decide how many of your rarer Poké Beans\nyou’d like to exchange for Plain Beans.[VAR 0114(002F)]
You don’t have space for so many Plain Beans![VAR 0114(002F)]
I’m sorry but you don’t have any of the special\nPoké Beans I’m looking for in a trade, my [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0403)]boygirl!\c\nIf you find a Patterned Bean, then I can give\nyou three Plain Beans for it.\c\nIf you find a Rainbow Bean, I’ll give you seven![VAR 0114(002F)]
You don’t have enough Plain Beans just now.\c\nYou’ve got to put seven Plain Beans in a Bean\nBottle to set it adrift. That’s just manners!\c\nWhy don’t you go see if you can find any to\npick up on Isle Abeens?[VAR 0114(002F)]
[VAR BE05(0002)]You obtained [VAR NUM3(0000)] Plain Bean[VAR NUMBRNCH(0000,0100)]s![VAR BE05(0003)]
Which Berry would you like to plant?[VAR 0114(002F)]
OK!\nI’m looking forward to that Berry harvest![VAR 0114(002F)]
You don’t have any\nBerries to plant.[VAR 0114(002F)]
You wouldn’t want to plant any Berries if you’ve\ngot no Pokémon about to help tend to them!\c\nCatch some more Pokémon and put them in\nyour Boxes, that’s a good [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0403)]boygirl![VAR 0114(002F)]
[VAR BE05(0000)]Looks like your Pokémon found some treasure\nduring their little adventure. Here you are![VAR BE05(0001)][VAR 0114(002F)]
Too bad. It looks like your Pokémon haven’t\nuncovered any treasure so far.[VAR 0114(002F)]
Will you pick a path to explore?[VAR 0114(002F)]
OK!\nThen it’s time to explore that cave!\c\nI wonder if they’ll find any treasure, hm?\nHo, I just can’t wait to see![VAR 0114(002F)]
You can’t send anyone to explore the cave if\nyou don’t have any Pokémon on the isle!\c\nCatch some more Pokémon and put them in your\nBoxes if you’d like them to have an adventure![VAR 0114(002F)]
Do you want to call your Pokémon back from\nthe current expedition?[VAR 0114(002F)]
OK! Everybody back!\nWe’re calling it for this expedition!\c\nJust tap on the sign and let me know if you want\nto send your Pokémon out to explore again.[VAR 0114(002F)]
Looks like you don’t have any Pokémon who are\nprepared to go out into that cave for you...\c\nYou should put out some Poké Beans when your\nPokémon are out exploring on your behalf![VAR 0114(002F)]
You don’t have any Pokémon out exploring now!\c\nYou should put out some Poké Beans when your\nPokémon are out exploring on your behalf![VAR 0114(002F)]
Think you could clear out that treasure crate for\nme before we send any more Pokémon out on\r\nanother adventure?
Choose the Pokémon that you’ll send out\nto play on the play gym![VAR 0114(002F)]
And what kind of drink would you like to make\nyour Pokémon? Hydration is key![VAR 0114(002F)]
How many play sessions should your Pokémon\ncomplete this time?[VAR 0114(002F)]
OK!\nLooks like we’re ready to go!\c\nI bet your Pokémon will have a great time.\nPlaying, getting stronger, and having a blast![VAR 0114(002F)]
Looks like a real fun time is being had, I’d say![VAR 0114(002F)]
Do you want to make your Pokémon quit in the\nmiddle of their play?[VAR 0114(002F)]
OK! Everybody back!\nPlaytime is over for now!\c\nAnd just tap on the sign whenever you want to\ncollect your Pokémon.[VAR 0114(002F)]
Did you come to collect your Pokémon?[VAR 0114(002F)]
I’ll just want to check the play structures before\nwe bring more Pokémon in to play.\c\nSorry, but could you collect all of your Pokémon\nso I can give it a quick look-over?[VAR 0114(002F)]
OK! Looks good.\nAll the equipment is in working condition!\c\nJust tap on the sign whenever you want to\nlet some more of your Pokémon loose to play![VAR 0114(002F)]
Your Boxes are full of Pokémon!\nGoodness gracious!\c\nIf you want to collect your Pokémon, you’ll need\nto make some space for them first.[VAR 0114(002F)]
You don’t have any Pokémon out playing on\nthe play equipment now.\c\nWhy don’t you start by inviting some Pokémon\nto come play here on the isle?[VAR 0114(002F)]
The play session has wrapped up, I’d say.\nTuckered your Pokémon right out, we did!\c\nYou should put out some Poké Beans while your\nPokémon play so that they have a snack ready![VAR 0114(002F)]
Choose the Pokémon you’d like to invite to relax\nin the hot spring![VAR 0114(002F)]
I’ll send [VAR PKNAME(0000)] to your Box then.[VAR 0114(002F)]
This Egg looks ready to hatch at any moment!\c\nBut your Boxes are full of Pokémon and there’s\nsimply no room for it!\c\nThink you could organize your Boxes a bit and\nfree up a space for it?[VAR 0114(002F)]
This Egg looks ready to hatch at any moment![VAR 0114(002F)]
I think this Egg’s still got a little while to go\nbefore it’ll be ready to hatch.[VAR 0114(002F)]
This Egg still looks like it’s a quite a while away\nfrom hatching.[VAR 0114(002F)]
It’s always a nice idea to put out Poké Beans\nin the crates after you invite Pokémon over.[VAR 0114(002F)]
Thank you, my [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0403)]boygirl!\nThe Pokémon will be delighted, no doubt![VAR 0114(002F)]
Thank you, my [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0403)]boygirl!\nThe Pokémon will be delighted, no doubt!\c\nThis will really help with the ol’ motivation![VAR 0114(002F)]
Thank you, my [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0403)]boygirl!\nThe Pokémon will be delighted, no doubt!\c\nThis will really help with the ol’ motivation![VAR 0114(002F)]
Thank you, my [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0403)]boygirl!\nThe Pokémon will be delighted, no doubt!\c\nThis’ll make things even more fun than usual![VAR 0114(002F)]
Thank you, my [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0403)]boygirl!\nThe Pokémon will be delighted, no doubt!\c\nThis should make things even more relaxing![VAR 0114(002F)]
[VAR BE05(0004)]Wild Pokémon are more likely to appear now![VAR BE05(0005)][VAR 0114(002F)]
[VAR BE05(0004)]Berries will grow twice as fast now![VAR BE05(0005)][VAR 0114(002F)]
[VAR BE05(0004)]Pokémon will finish their explorations twice as\nfast now![VAR BE05(0005)][VAR 0114(002F)]

Would you like to take a closer look at\n[VAR PKNICK(0000)]?[VAR 0114(002F)]
That wild [VAR PKNAME(0000)] seems real pleased\nto have gotten some attention from you!\c\nYou know, it looks like it might just settle down\nand decide to stay here!\c\nOK then! Why don’t you give it a day and\ncome see how it’s feeling again tomorrow?[VAR 0114(002F)]

[VAR PKNICK(0000)] is looking good!\c\nBut I don’t think you’re going to be able to raise\nits base Speed stat any higher than this!

Welcome!\nYou’ve come to Poké Pelago!\c\nThese uninhabited islands exist solely for the\ndelight of Pokémon.\c\nBut I suppose I should introduce myself, eh?\nHa ha, how rude of me!\c\nYou can call me Mohn!\nI’m in charge of keeping Poké Pelago running.[VAR 0114(0030)]
And you are...[VAR TRNAME(0000)], right?\c\nOK!\nThen let’s get things started![VAR 0114(002F)]
The Pokémon that you’ve deposited in your PC\nBoxes can freely come here to Poké Pelago to\r\nhave a bit of fun whenever they want.\c\nRight now we only have one small isle available\nfor them to play on, but if you’ll help me out,\r\nthat won’t be true for very long!\c\nSo here’s what you need to do first.\nWould you pick up the Poké Beans that have\r\nfallen to the ground around the island?[VAR 0114(002F)]
Pokémon love Poké Beans.\nThey’re delicious and nutritious!\c\nAnd they can also sprout into Poké Beanstalks,\nlike that one in the middle of the island.\c\nThe one you just picked up is a Plain Bean.\nThere are also rare Poké Beans called Patterned\r\nBeans and even Rainbow Beans!\c\nI love hands-on learning. Don’t you agree?\nSo why don’t you give that Poké Beanstalk a\r\ngood shake and see what happens?[VAR 0114(002F)]
Shake the beanstalk to drop some Poké Beans!\nPick up the Poké Beans to add to your stores!\c\nOK, now you’ve got it!\nSee! Isn’t it better to learn by doing?\c\nYou can collect Poké Beans once a day or so.\c\nIf no new Poké Beans come tumbling down,\nthen wait a day and then try again![VAR 0114(002F)]
Put some of the Poké Beans you collect into the\nPoké Bean crate on the island, would you?\c\nThen they’ll be handy for any hungry Pokémon\nwandering around the island to eat anytime![VAR 0114(002F)]
Yup! That’s a Poké Bean crate right there!\nYou can drop Poké Beans in there, and the\r\nPokémon will love you for it.\c\nEspecially here on Isle Abeens. Leaving Poké\nBeans in the crate here can even tempt wild\r\nPokémon to come by for a gander and some fun.[VAR 0114(002F)]
Oh, yes! One more thing! The rarer kinds of\nPoké Beans will have their effects last longer.\r\nYou might want to remember that fact!\c\nBut as long as you fill the crate up, then you’ll\nprobably be A-OK. Don’t you worry!\c\nAnd if you ever want to talk to me about things,\nno need to feel shy.\r\nJust zip right over to my raft hut![VAR 0114(002F)]
Wonderful to see you again!\nI’m delighted to welcome you to my raft hut!\c\nThis has been my own private castle ever since\nthat fateful day when I decided to turn these\r\nuninhabited islands into a resort for Pokémon.\c\nI built this place myself and it’s not too shabby,\nif I dare say so myself.\c\nI have everything I could need here to keep\nPoké Pelago up and running.[VAR 0114(002F)]
So, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\c\nI’ve got a favor to ask of a promising Trainer\nlike yourself.\c\nPoké Pelago only features one small island at\nthe moment, as you’ve seen.\c\nIf you were to liken it to a Pokémon, it would be\na Lv. 1 babe just hatched from its Egg!\c\nSo I’d like you and your Pokémon to put some\neffort into developing the islands here![VAR 0114(002F)]
Developing the isles here basically means\nbreaking ground on new isles or improving the\r\nfacilities on isles you already have started on.\c\nWe’ll borrow the strength of the Pokémon you\nhave in your Boxes to do the work.\c\nOh, and we’ll need some Plain Beans!\nDon’t forget those!\r\nNo one can work well on an empty stomach![VAR 0114(002F)]
OK!\nThat’s it from me right now.\c\nBut come see me in my Raft Hut anytime\nthat you want some help developing isles![VAR 0114(002F)]
Mohn here!\nI keep things running here at Poké Pelago.[VAR 0114(002F)]

The Poké Beanstalk has gotten larger, so you\ncan probably get more Poké Beans from it now!\c\nI bet more wild Pokémon will come by, enticed\nby its offerings.\c\nThe Pokémon all look quite eager!\nKeep up the hard work![VAR 0114(002F)]
That Poké Beanstalk is truly formidable.\nI’ll bet you get even more Poké Beans now!\c\nAnd even more wild Pokémon coming by to play\nand to marvel at it, too!\c\nYour Pokémon look eager to check it out, too.\nThanks for helping improve Poké Pelago![VAR 0114(002F)]
OK! What do you think?\nThis is Isle Aplenny!\c\nI used that nice flat bit of land there to make\na field where you can plant your Berries.\c\nNow your Pokémon can enjoy tending to Berry\ntrees and harvesting Berries here![VAR 0114(002F)]
Thanks to your Pokémon’s hard work, we’ve\nbeen able to expand the Berry fields!\c\nNow you can grow up to 12 different types of\nBerries at a time.\c\nIt should also be easier to water the seedlings\nnow, so I bet your harvest might increase, too!\c\nYour Pokémon look delighted with the new field.\nKeep up the hard work![VAR 0114(002F)]
Now Isle Aplenny is completely covered with\nBerry fields!\c\nYou can plant and grow up to 18 different\ntypes of Berries now.\c\nAnd it’s even easier to water the seedlings,\nso I bet your harvest will increase more, too!\c\nThanks for helping Poké Pelago grow![VAR 0114(002F)]
OK! What do you think?\nThis is Isle Aphun!\c\nThere’s a big cave on this island, so now your\nPokémon can explore it and have adventures.[VAR 0114(002F)]
We’ve excavated further and made some new\npaths through the cave!\c\nYour Pokémon might be able to find some rare\nstones if they explore the new path.\c\nThey look pretty pumped up for an adventure!\nKeep up the hard work![VAR 0114(002F)]
The paths through the cave have increased!\nNow your Pokémon can explore deep into the\r\nisland’s underground!\c\nThey might find some real treasures in there!\c\nI’d say your Pokémon look thrilled to explore!\nThanks again for helping develop Poké Pelago![VAR 0114(002F)]
OK! What do you say?\nThis is Isle Evelup!\c\nThere are logs and things to climb, and a nice\nsandy area to play in and exercise with.\c\nNow your Pokémon can help themselves to\ngrow stronger while they have fun![VAR 0114(002F)]
We have some new play structures for your\nPokémon to play on!\c\nNow you can invite up to 12 of your Pokémon\nhere to play at a time.\c\nI bet your Pokémon will be delighted!\nKeep up the hard work![VAR 0114(002F)]
We’ve used the driftwood that was buried in\nthe beach to make even more equipment!\c\nYou can now have up to 18 Pokémon playing on\nthe equipment here at one time.\c\nI’m sure your Pokémon will be delighted!\nThanks for all your help developing Poké Pelago![VAR 0114(002F)]
OK! What do you think?\nThis is Isle Avue!\c\nI’ve used the warm water that wells up beneath\nthis island here to make a hot spring bath!\c\nYour Pokémon will be able to relax and get\nreal cozy here.[VAR 0114(002F)]
We added another hot spring bath to the isle!\c\nNow you can have up to 12 Pokémon enter the\nbaths at once.\c\nAnd the fountain that provides the water is\nalso bigger, so I bet your Pokémon will be able\r\nto relax even better in the abundant water.\c\nYour Pokémon are looking pretty cozy to me!\nKeep up the hard work![VAR 0114(002F)]
Now all of Isle Avue has been converted to\nhot spring baths!\c\nYou can have up to 18 Pokémon in the baths\nat once now.\c\nThe fountain where the water flows from looks\nquite magnificent now, and your Pokémon will\r\nbe feeling relaxed in no time, I’d say!\c\nYour Pokémon are looking pretty cozy to me!\nThanks for helping develop Poké Pelago![VAR 0114(002F)]
That’s right! If you want to plant some Berries,\ntap the sign and let me know!\c\nYour Pokémon are looking pretty happy.\nKeep up the good work![VAR 0114(002F)]
That’s right! If you want your Pokémon to\nexplore one of the cave’s paths, tap the sign\r\nand let me know!\c\nAnd if they find anything while they explore,\nI’ll have them leave it in that treasure crate\r\nthat’s in the middle of the island.\c\nYour Pokémon look thrilled to get out there!\nKeep up the good work![VAR 0114(002F)]
That’s right! Check out the sign there and you\ncan decide which Pokémon you want to invite\r\nto play here at Isle Evelup!\c\nI’ve also prepared some special drinks for the\nPokémon playing here at Isle Evelup.\c\nJust a little treat from me for the hard workers!\c\nAnd you should choose a drink you’d like to\nshare with your Pokémon when you’re deciding\r\nwho you want to call out to play.\c\nYour Pokémon will be delighted!\nKeep up the good work![VAR 0114(002F)]
That’s right! Check out the sign there and you\ncan let me know which Pokémon you’ll send\r\nover to relax here at Isle Avue!\c\nYour Pokémon will be perfectly at home here!\nKeep up the good work![VAR 0114(002F)]
Welcome!\nYou’ve come to Poké Pelago!\c\nThese uninhabited islands exist solely for the\ndelight of Pokémon.\c\nHmm? Hold the phone!\c\nYou don’t seem to have any Pokémon in your\nPC Boxes, now do you?\c\nPoké Pelago is a resort designed to entertain\nthe Pokémon you deposit in your PC Boxes.\c\nWhy don’t you put some Pokémon in your Boxes\nand then come visit us again?
Looks like you’ve got more than 30 Pokémon\nin your PC Boxes now!\c\nYou’ll be needing more Poké Beans then.\nI guess I’ve got to work harder, too![VAR 0114(002F)]
Looks like you’ve got more than 90 Pokémon\nin your PC Boxes now!\c\nYou’ll be needing a lot of Poké Beans then!\nI guess I’ve got to work harder, too![VAR 0114(002F)]
Looks like you’ve got more than 150 Pokémon\nin your PC Boxes now!\c\nYou’ll be needing whole piles of Poké Beans!\nI guess I’ve got to work harder, too![VAR 0114(002F)]
Oh? Your Boxes are beginning to look a bit\nlonely with so few Pokémon in them now.\c\nI’d love to see a good 30 or so Pokémon tucked\nsafely away in them![VAR 0114(002F)]
Oh? Your Boxes are beginning to look a bit\nlonely with so few Pokémon in them now.\c\nI’d love to see a good 90 or so Pokémon tucked\nsafely away in them![VAR 0114(002F)]

Welcome!\nYou’ve come to Poké Pelago!\c\nThese uninhabited islands exist solely for the\ndelight of Pokémon you’ve deposited in your\r\nPC Boxes.\c\nHmm? Hold the phone!\c\nYou don’t seem to have any Pokémon in your\nPC Boxes, now do you?\c\nWhy don’t you go catch a bunch of Pokémon\nand put some in your PC Boxes before you\r\ncome visit us again?[VAR 0114(002F)]
You’ve got everything you need to develop an\nisle for Poké Pelago! Did you know that?\c\nStop by my Raft Hut and check it out![VAR 0114(002F)]
[VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\c\nWe’ve done it! Poké Pelago has been fully\ndeveloped into its final, perfect form!\c\nAnd it’s all thanks to you, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\nThank you so much!\c\nI know this isn’t much, but I hope that you’ll\ntake it as an expression of my gratitude![VAR 0114(002F)]
[VAR BE05(0002)]You obtained 10 Rainbow Beans![VAR BE05(0003)][VAR 0114(002F)]
I hope you’ll continue to use Poké Pelago to\ngreat effect with your Pokémon!
Oh! This’ll be your first Bean Bottle, won’t it?\c\nYes, a Bean Bottle is just what it sounds like:\na bottle that has Poké Beans in it.\c\nBean Bottles sometimes wash up to onto the\nshore here at these isles.\c\nThey must have been set adrift by someone\nelse out in this wide world, which is connected\r\nall over by the great oceans!\c\nPeople set these bottles adrift hoping that they\nmight bring some happiness to the person\r\nwho finds one!\c\nIt’s a pretty romantic idea, isn’t it?\nAnd that’s A-OK in my book![VAR 0114(002F)]
If you bring happiness to someone else, then\nmaybe something good will happen to you, too!\c\nThat’s why it never hurts to do something nice\nlike setting a Bean Bottle adrift in the ocean.\c\nBut you can only send out one Bean Bottle per\nday, I’m afraid.\c\nHappiness that can be bought cheaply might\nend up inviting unhappiness instead![VAR 0114(002F)]
Poké Beans can come in special varieties called\nPatterned Beans and Rainbow Beans.\c\nYou can sometimes find these rare Poké Beans\non Isle Abeens, if you’re lucky.\c\nThey are absolutely delicious, so your Pokémon\nwill be delighted if you feed one to them![VAR 0114(002F)]
In fact...I’ll let you in on a little secret.\nPatterned Beans and Rainbow Beans are in fact\r\nsome of my favorite foods, as well!\c\nThey have delightful flavor and just the right\namount of chew.\r\nOnce I start eating them, I can’t stop myself!\c\n... ... ...\c\nHey now, please don’t look at me like that...\c\nI’ve been working here managing Poké Pelago\nfor a very long time and it’s a really tough habit\r\nto break![VAR 0114(002F)]
OK!\nSo let’s trade some beans![VAR 0114(002F)]
[~ 241]
So you’ll help me! Thank you, thank you.\nAnd now that we have that settled...\c\nOK then! There are five isles total that you can\ndevelop here at Poké Pelago!\c\nEach one will require you to have a different\nnumber of Pokémon in your Boxes and\r\nPlain Beans in your coffers![VAR 0114(002F)]
Check what it says that you need to develop\neach isle in its summary, OK?\c\nOK then! If that’s all clear, you just tell me\nwhich isle you’d like to develop next![VAR 0114(002F)]
Anyway, you don’t need to worry yourself about\nmy diet. This is all you need to know:\c\nI’ll give you three Plain Beans for each\nPatterned Bean you offer me.\r\nAnd seven Plain Beans for each Rainbow Bean!\c\nSo what do you say to a little trade?[VAR 0114(002F)]
Looks like there’s no more space to plant any\nBerries in that field!\c\nWhy don’t you harvest some of your ripe Berries\nand free up a little space to plant in?[VAR 0114(002F)]
We’ve done it! It’s the perfect Poké Pelago\nI’ve always dreamed of! You’ve done it!\c\nOK!\nThis is fantastic!\c\nAnd it’s all thanks to you, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\nThank you so much!\c\nPoké Pelago now belongs to you and your\nPokémon, I’d say!\c\nI hope you’ll continue to use it to great effect![VAR 0114(002F)]
It looks like it’s going to be a good long while\nuntil this Egg hatches.[VAR 0114(002F)]
Looks to me like you have plenty of Plain Beans.\nLet’s trade when your stores have gone down.[VAR 0114(002F)]
You’ve come at just the right time!\nThis Egg looks ready to hatch at any moment![VAR 0114(002F)]
You should add some Poké Beans after you’ve\nplanted a few Berries first![VAR 0114(002F)]
The Bean Bottle was sent adrift out to sea![VAR 0114(002F)]
Do you want to leave Poké Pelago?[VAR 0114(002F)]
OK!\nThen come back soon![VAR 0114(002F)]
Looks like you should be able to develop the\nIsle Abeens now!\c\nI’ll be waiting for you in the Raft Hut![VAR 0114(002F)]
Looks like you should be able to develop the\nIsle Aplenny now!\c\nI’ll be waiting for you in the Raft Hut![VAR 0114(002F)]
Looks like you should be able to develop the\nIsle Aphun now!\c\nI’ll be waiting for you in the Raft Hut![VAR 0114(002F)]
Looks like you should be able to develop the\nIsle Evelup now!\c\nI’ll be waiting for you in the Raft Hut![VAR 0114(002F)]

I’m a Pokémon Nursery lady.\c\nI help take care of the Pokémon of Trainers\nlike you.\c\nLately, for some reason, I see some Pokémon\nholding Eggs. It’s mysterious, isn’t it?\c\nIf you want us to take care of your Pokémon,\nplease speak to my sister inside the building.
Alola!\c\n[VAR PKNAME(0000)] is doing just fine!
Alola!\c\n[VAR PKNAME(0000)] and [VAR PKNAME(0001)] are doing\njust fine!\c\nThey really seem to like hanging out!
Alola!\c\n[VAR PKNAME(0000)] and [VAR PKNAME(0001)] are doing\njust fine!\c\nThey seem to get along all right.
Alola!\c\n[VAR PKNAME(0000)] and [VAR PKNAME(0001)] are doing\njust fine! They don’t seem to like each other\r\nvery much, though.
Alola!\c\n[VAR PKNAME(0000)] and [VAR PKNAME(0001)] are doing\njust fine! They don’t seem to like playing\r\ntogether, though.
Oh hey!\c\nI have surprising news for you!\c\nYour Pokémon was holding an Egg!\c\nIt’s like a total mystery where it came from,\nbut you want the Egg your Pokémon was\r\nholding, right?
You received the Egg from the Pokémon\nNursery lady.
Please take good care of it!
Oh your party is full...\c\nPlease come back again after making space for\nthe Egg.
I’ll keep it if you don’t want it, but you want it,\ndon’t you?
Then I’ll take it.\nThank you.
Hi, I’m a Pokémon Nursery lady.\c\nWe can take up to two of your Pokémon.
Hi, I’m a Pokémon Nursery lady.\nWould you like us to take care of your Pokémon?
OK. Come back another time.
Oh, my little sister was looking for you!
If you leave the Pokémon with me, you won’t be\nable to battle.\c\nPlease come back again with more Pokémon.
Which Pokémon shall I take care of?
Don’t be silly.\nThat’s an Egg!
All right. I’ll take care of your [VAR PKNAME(0000)]\nfor a while.
Come back again after a while.
We can take up to two of your Pokémon.\nWould you like to leave one more Pokémon?
You have very energetic Pokémon, don’t you?\nDo you want to take one back?
[~ 23]
If you want your [VAR PKNAME(0000)] back now,\nit will cost you $[VAR NUM5(0001,002C)].
You don’t seem to have enough money...
You took back your [VAR PKNAME(0000)] from the\nPokémon Nursery lady.
Do you want to take the other one back, too?
Oh...\c\nIf you leave a Pokémon with me, you’ll be left\nwith only the one.\c\nCatch some more Pokémon and come back.
Your party is full!\c\nMake room, and then come see me again.

Hello there! You must be one of Ilima’s friends?
Come on in! Any friend to my son is a friend\nto me!
Just one thing, though.\c\nI’d like to hear what you think of my boy.\nIs he doing a good job as a captain?
He’s a good captain
I’m not really sure
Sorry. I probably shouldn’t have asked you\nsomething like that out of the blue...\c\nOur Ilima has just always been obsessed with\nPokémon battling, ever since he was a boy.\c\nHe’s like a different person when he\nbattles—you can see it in his eyes!\c\nI’ve always been a little worried about\nwhether he would do all right as a captain.
Sorry to hold you up.\nIf you’re looking for Ilima, he’s in his room.
Any friend of my son’s is welcome here.\nStay as long as you’d like.
Thank you for coming, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].[VAR 0114(000C)]
And you’ve arrived with such exquisite timing!\c\nI’ve been conducting research on battle planning\nfor quite some time, and at last my simulation\r\nis complete![VAR 0114(000C)]
Would you be so kind as to test it with\nme, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]?[VAR 0114(000C)]
Not now
Sure
What a shame.\c\nPlease do let me know when you are available.[VAR 0114(000C)]
You have my gratitude.\c\nVery well then. To the Trainers’ School![VAR 0114(000C)]
Before we begin, allow me to explain...\c\nIt’s not battle results that interest me.\nRather, it’s the carefully-thought-out strategies\r\nor novel tactics employed by Trainers.\c\nHow those plans affect one’s opponent and\ninfluence the outcome of battles—that is where\r\nmy interest lies![VAR 0114(000C)]
Now give me everything you’ve\ngot, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]![VAR 0114(000C)]
Wonderful! What a truly wonderful battle!\c\nI’ll be feeling the aftershocks from that battle\nfor a long time to come. That was the best I\r\ncould’ve hoped for![VAR 0114(000C)]
The way that Ilima looked in that battle seems\nto linger in your mind...
Thank you.\c\nAllow me to treat you to some tea and snacks\nback in my room.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Will you be on your way then?\c\nAllow me to offer you this as payment for\nyour assistance.[VAR 0114(000C)]
When a Pokémon holds an Everstone, it will\nnot evolve.\c\nIt has other effects as well, but let’s set those\naside for now.\c\nMay our friendship last as long as an Everstone![VAR 0114(000C)]
I think I’ll begin analyzing our battle data.\c\nThere are so many amazing discoveries yet to\nbe made! Someday I hope to share them\r\nwith everyone![VAR 0114(000C)]

Who are you, [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0406)]misterlady?\nAre you one of Sissy’s friends?
It’s a stranger!\nWho are you? Who are you?
Wow!\nAn island challenge amulet!
Sissy isn’t here!\nBut I think she’s coming home, soon.
Play with us till Sissy comes home!
OK
What?
Then I wanna have a battle!\nLet’s do a moldy battle!
Meanie! Big, stinky meanie!\nCome on, play with us!
It’s not a moldy battle!\nIt’s a Multi Battle! We’ll have a Multi Battle!
Yeah, that. So what do you say?\nYou ready, M[VAR GENDBR(00FF,0F0D)]r. Trainer guiss Trainer lady?
You’re on!
Not yet
Come on!\nHurry up and get ready already!
Come on!\nYou can’t fight without enough Pokémon!
Wowzers!\nYou are sure strong, M[VAR GENDBR(00FF,0F0D)]r. Trainer guiss Trainer lady!
You might even be stronger than Sissy!
I’m home, girls.[VAR 0114(000D)]
Sissy!
Welcome home!
Oh! [VAR TRNAME(0000)]?\nYou came to visit with us?[VAR 0114(000D)]
M[VAR GENDBR(00FF,0F0D)]r. Trainer guiss Trainer lady was playing with us!
[VAR GENDBR(00FF,0201)]HShe is really strong. Did you know that?
Well, thank you, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].\c\nFor entertaining my little sisters so kindly.[VAR 0114(000D)]
Hey, Sissy! Sissy!
Who’s probably stronger? You or this Trainer?\nLike, if you were REALLY trying?
Yeah, who?
Who’s stronger? Are you stronger?
Well... I don’t rightly know.\n[VAR TRNAME(0000)] is definitely strong h[VAR GENDBR(0000,0202)]imerself.[VAR 0114(000D)]
But we wanna know who’s stronger!
Battle h[VAR GENDBR(00FF,0202)]imer!
It looks like I’ve got little choice...\c\nOnce the girls have their minds set, they don’t\nbudge, no matter how hard you try.[VAR 0114(000D)]
Come on! Do it!
Battle! Battle!
If you don’t mind, [VAR TRNAME(0000)], could I ask\nyou for a battle?\c\nThe truth is that I’ve also been wanting to see\nhow we might compare in skill![VAR 0114(000D)]
Sure!
Umm...
I know these girls would love to see us battle,\nso please come back anytime to take me on.\c\nAnd perhaps I should warn you...\nI am quite strong![VAR 0114(000D)]
All right!
We knew you would do it!
Why don’t we go out front, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]?\c\nI would have some advantage battling inside\nthe house, since I’m so familiar with the layout.[VAR 0114(000D)]
Go on! Beat h[VAR GENDBR(00FF,0202)]imer, Sissy!
Show h[VAR GENDBR(00FF,0202)]imer what you’ve got!
Shall we?[VAR 0114(000D)]
I have a responsibility to set a good example\nfor my younger sisters, of course.\c\nBut even more important than that...I have my\npride as a captain!\c\nI will show you what a serious Lana can do![VAR 0114(000D)]
I look forward to enjoying a no-holds-barred\nbattle again you, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]![VAR 0114(000D)]
Phew...[VAR 0114(000D)]
No way! She lost!\nSissy actually lost!
That’s amazing!\nM[VAR GENDBR(00FF,0F0D)]r. Trainer guiss Trainer lady is amazing!
[VAR TRNAME(0000)], that was fantastic!\nYou and your Pokémon were perfectly in sync!\c\nIt seems I was premature in thinking that my full\npower would be enough to defeat you.[VAR 0114(000D)]
The way that Lana looked in that battle seems\nto linger in your mind...
How boring! I can’t believe Sissy lost!\nPoo. I’m going home.
Me, too!\nGimme a piggyback ride!
Fine, fine...\nLet’s all be getting back home.\c\nBut I will not be carrying you!\nYou can walk on your own two feet.\r\nWhat else do you think you have feet for?[VAR 0114(000D)]
Thank you again for playing with my sisters.\c\n...Here. Please have this and use it if you think\nit might be helpful.[VAR 0114(000D)]
My father is expecting me to help on the boat,\nso I should be going soon.\c\nBut you feel free to stay as long as you want,\n[VAR TRNAME(0000)]. My home is yours.[VAR 0114(000D)]
Hey, strong M[VAR GENDBR(00FF,0F0D)]r. Trainer guiss Trainer lady!
Hiya, M[VAR GENDBR(00FF,0F0D)]r. Trainer guiss Trainer lady!

Hey, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]! What’s up?[VAR 0114(000E)]
I came to play with you!
I’m here for a battle!
All right, let’s do it!\c\nOf course if two Trainers are going to play, it’s\ngotta be a Pokémon battle, right?\c\nYup, it’s decided! I guess we should head to\nLush Jungle.\c\nLet’s make this like a little treasure hunt. Come\nfind me where the Wimpod is! Don’t be late![VAR 0114(000E)]
Mallow! Can you give me a hand?
Huh? Where’s Mallow?
In the jungle
She’s not here
At this hour? That’s not like her...\c\nbut now I’m in a jam. I was going to ask her to\ngo do some shopping for me.
If you see her, can you tell her something\nfor me?\c\nTell her to bring my Wimpod with her when\nshe comes home.
Oh, you made it![VAR 0114(000E)]
Wimpod is in my big brother’s party.[VAR 0114(000E)]
Wi-wim!
It’s out here gathering ingredients for\nour restaurant![VAR 0114(000E)]
Wi-wim-wim!
You’ve got all the ingredients you need for a\ndelicious battle, right?[VAR 0114(000E)]
Let’s do this!
Gimme a minute...
Oh really? Well come back and tell me when\nyou’re ready![VAR 0114(000E)]
Time for you to see that I can do more than\njust cook![VAR 0114(000E)]
That battle was a piece of cake for you, wasn’t\nit? I should’ve known—you did clear my trial,\r\nafter all!\c\nAs your captain, I am very proud of you, though![VAR 0114(000E)]
The way that Mallow looked in that battle\nseems to linger in your mind...
There’s no doubt in my mind that you’ll go on to\nbe an amazing Trainer!\c\nLike, you could even be a kahuna someday![VAR 0114(000E)]
There’s no doubt in my mind that you’ll go on to\nbe an amazing Trainer!\c\nLike, you could even be a kahuna someday![VAR 0114(000E)]
Do you ever think about the\nfuture, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]?[VAR 0114(000E)]
I do
Nope
Oh, I see. Well, I’ve got my future all planned out!\c\nI mean, we have to move on from being captains\nwhen we turn 20 anyway.\c\nIt may be ordinary, but I’m hoping to take over\nmy family’s restaurant.\c\nI think I could be an even better chef than my\ndad and big brother one day![VAR 0114(000E)]
Huh? What’s up?\c\nIs it something about my big brother?[VAR 0114(000E)]
He had a favor to ask...
He told me to tell you...
Sorry, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]! I’ve gotta get back!\c\nCome on, Wimpod. You, too! Big brother’s\nwaiting for us![VAR 0114(000E)]
Wi-wi-wi-wim!
It’s been fun, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\nSee you later! Bye![VAR 0114(000E)]

Yah! Hoo! Hee! Hyah![VAR 0114(000F)]
Huhn?[VAR 0114(000F)]
Oh. It’s you, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].[VAR 0114(000F)]
What are you doing?
What was that all about?
This is my fire dance training.[VAR 0114(000F)]
This is my torch staff.\c\nWhen I’m actually performing fire dances, I’ll light\nit on fire.[VAR 0114(000F)]
Whenever I have free time, I practice my dance\nas much as I can.\c\nIt takes a lot of repetition to get good at it...just\nlike Pokémon battles.[VAR 0114(000F)]
Oh, look at the time![VAR 0114(000F)]
Sorry, I know you just got here, but I have to go\nto the Thrifty Megamart.\c\nIf you need to talk to me, come meet me there.[VAR 0114(000F)]
I see...[VAR 0114(000F)]
Kiawe, I’m really terribly sorry about this, but\nI’ve thought long and hard about this decision.\c\nIf it comes down to people who are counting on\nthis job to make a living, and you...
It’s all right.\c\nI know how hard you’ve worked to open this\nlocation after the guardian deity destroyed the\r\nprevious one in anger.\c\nI understand, boss.[VAR 0114(000F)]
Kiawe...\c\nI’ve given you as much as I can afford. Spend\nyour final paycheck wisely.
Thank you very much.[VAR 0114(000F)]
I hope your dream of studying dance abroad\ncomes true someday.\c\nI have to keep working hard here to make my\ndreams for the Thrifty Megamart come true.
It’s OK, boss. You can head back in now.[VAR 0114(000F)]
Thank you. I’ll be seeing you.
How could this happen...?[VAR 0114(000F)]
Oh, it’s you, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].[VAR 0114(000F)]
If you don’t mind, I’d like to battle\nyou, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].[VAR 0114(000F)]
Of course
Just a minute
I see... I’ll be waiting for you here, then.[VAR 0114(000F)]
I don’t feel like dancing by myself right now...[VAR 0114(000F)]
So strong...\c\nI should’ve known. You did clear my trial,\nafter all.\c\nBy the way, did you overhear what we were\njust talking about?[VAR 0114(000F)]
What are you talking about?
Yeah, kind of...
You’re too considerate, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].[VAR 0114(000F)]
Yes, of course you did...[VAR 0114(000F)]
My dream is to become a professional\nfire dancer.\c\nI’ve been saving up forever to go study\ndance abroad.\c\nBut I was just laid off from my part-time job. It\nseems like nothing ever goes right...[VAR 0114(000F)]
Sorry.\c\nI didn’t mean to trouble you with my\nproblems, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].\c\nYou’re so easy to talk to, though. I feel much\nbetter after talking with you.\r\nThank you for being there.\c\nI’ll be going then.\nUntil we meet again, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]![VAR 0114(000F)]
The way that Kiawe looked in that battle seems\nto linger in your mind...

You little brat![VAR 0114(0017)]
I don’t know what you think you’re doing here,\nbut I actually needed to talk to you.\c\nGet your rear over to the\nHau’oli City Beachfront![VAR 0114(0017)]
So you showed up...[VAR 0114(0017)]
Well, [VAR TRNAME(0000)], it’s time to battle\nyour boy![VAR 0114(0017)]
Here I come![VAR 0114(0017)]
Wait a minute...[VAR 0114(0017)]
What did you think I asked you to come\nhere for?![VAR 0114(0017)]
This is to make up for when I had to disband\nTeam Skull!\c\nJust so you know, I’ll never change!\c\nWanna see what destruction looks like?\nHere it is in human form—it’s your boy Guzma![VAR 0114(0017)]
Guzma!\nWhat is wrong with you?!\c\nThis outcome hasn’t changed at all either![VAR 0114(0017)]
Well played, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]![VAR 0114(0008)]
You came all the way here just to watch me\nlose, huh? Must be nice to be a lazy old island\r\nkahuna with nothing better to do...[VAR 0114(0017)]
What a high opinion of yourself you have. Ha!\c\nI just happened to see [VAR TRNAME(0000)] here,\nso I thought I would come over.[VAR 0114(0008)]
You wanna get beat down, old man?[VAR 0114(0017)]
Oh, Guzma...when will you understand?\nOnly when you respect your opponent’s skill\r\nwill it bring out the best in you.\c\nYou miss the true meaning of battling.\nThe goal is not to beat your opponent down,\r\nbut for both Trainers to grow stronger![VAR 0114(0008)]
I don’t care what you say to me, yo.\nBeating people down is all I know![VAR 0114(0017)]
But the battle I just saw seemed a bit different.\c\nWhile you may say you’re only interested in\ncrushing your opponent, I sensed a desire to\r\ndefeat [VAR TRNAME(0000)] deep in your heart.[VAR 0114(0008)]
What do you know, old man?![VAR 0114(0017)]
If you continue on this path, you’ll never be able\nto defeat [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\c\nGuzma, admit the worthiness of your\nopponents! Only then can you become even\r\nstronger than you already are!\c\nAllow yourself to know the people and Pokémon\nyou encounter, and look deeply into your heart.[VAR 0114(0008)]
You’re still trying to front like you’re my master,\nhuh? I gave up on you a long time ago.[VAR 0114(0017)]
[VAR TRNAME(0000)], allow me to handle this foolish\nyoung man.\c\nI will make a fine Trainer out of him yet, or I’m\nnot an island kahuna!\c\nI hope that can be considered penance for the\nwrongs he and Team Skull have committed.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Tch![VAR 0114(0017)]
Oh ho ho! The two of us will go many\nplaces together!\c\nAnd we will meet more people and Pokémon who\nwill enrich our lives.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Master...[VAR 0114(0017)]
I ain’t never gonna ask you to forgive me,\nso don’t get it twisted—this is no apology!\c\nBut shut up and take this! I got it for my first\never victory, and it’s always been like my\r\nlucky charm![VAR 0114(0017)]

Would you look at that [VAR PKNAME(0001)]!
I think it can still put out a bit more effort!
It’s clearly put out a great deal of effort!\c\nWhy don’t you pin this ribbon on it so that it\nfeels rewarded for all that hard effort?
You received an Effort Ribbon!
You put the Effort Ribbon on [VAR PKNAME(0001)]!
Now, now, look at that! I’d say that Effort\nRibbon goes perfectly with [VAR PKNAME(0001)]!
Would you like to show me how much your\nPokémon have grown since joining your team?
Oh? Well, that is too bad...
Which Pokémon will you show me, then?
Ho! This is a hard one...
Hm? It’s rather hard to judge how well you’ve\nraised an Egg, you know.
Oh! It looks like this [VAR PKNAME(0001)] was only...\nLv. [VAR NUM3(0002)] when you first met!\r\nAnd now it’s Lv. [VAR NUM3(0003)]!
That is some amazing growth.\nI can feel your deep love for your Pokémon.
That’s some decent growth, all right.\nYou’ve been real decent to it.
That’s no different at all!\c\nI hope you’ll continue your journey so that you\nboth can grow a whole lot together.
How do you grow together?\nBy walking the same path with someone else.\c\nLet me give you this as a reward for showing\nme how far you two have come along together.
You received a Footprint Ribbon!
You put the Footprint Ribbon on\n[VAR PKNAME(0001)]!
Your love leaves its marks as surely as your\npassing leaves your footprints upon the sand...\c\nI’m grateful that you were willing to show me\nthe wonderful bond between you and your team.
The path that you’ve walked together with\n[VAR PKNAME(0001)] is perfectly easy for me to see,\r\nthanks to that glittering Footprint Ribbon there!
Oh! Your [VAR PKNAME(0000)]!
I guess maybe you’ll show it some affection\nsoon, huh?
It’s starting to look like it likes you!
You’ve been showing it some affection, huh?\nYou two are looking good!
You two look like great friends!\nYou must play with it a whole lot, huh?
You’ve got to be some of the most affectionate\nfriends I’ve ever seen! I think I’m jealous!
[VAR PKNAME(0001)] got a Best Friends Ribbon!
I hope you’ll stay friends forever and ever!\nAnd ever and ever!
You’re the best friends ever, aren’t you!\c\nNo wonder your Pokémon is wearing that\nBest Friends Ribbon!
Ribbons...\c\nThey’re like a way to wrap your Pokémon up in\nprecious memories for perpetuity.\c\nI’ve heard that there are a lot of different kinds\nof ribbons in other regions, outside of Alola.

Hey, kid!\nYou’re a local, right? From around here?\c\nI’ve got a favor I want to ask someone like you!\nPlease, you’ve gotta help me!
All right
I’m busy
What?! Oh, come on!\nDon’t be so cold! Where’s your Alola spirit?!
Oh, thanks, kid!\nThat’s the Alola spirit! You’re all so nice here!\c\nI’m actually here on my honeymoon, and my\nbeautiful bride has completely fallen for this\r\nPokémon you have here called Rockruff!\c\nShe just can’t get enough of its curled little tail \nand that rocky fur around its neck.\c\nI’ve heard you can find them in Ten Carat Hill,\nbut I’m really lost here...
Could you go to Ten Carat Hill and catch one\nfor me?\c\nIf you do, then I can check out its information\nin your ’Dex, and then I can go catch one myself!\c\nI’ll even pay you for your hassle.\nThink of it as a bit of part-time work, OK?
It’s that Pokémon with the curled up tail.\nThe one you guys call Rockruff!\c\nThey’re supposed to live in Ten Carat Hill,\nso catch one for me, please!
Oh! You’ve caught a Rockruff!\nLet me see your ’Dex for a second!
Mm-hmm... I see...\c\nSo Rockruff hit the rocks around their necks\nagainst each other in a sort of greeting?\c\nWow. So, they’re not just cute...\nThey’re pretty interesting Pokémon, too.
All right. Thanks for this, pal!\nNow I’ll go and try to catch one for myself.\c\nHere. It’s not much, but here’s your pay.\nYou’ve earned it!
All right... Now it’s time that I set out to find\na Rockruff of my own for my beautiful bride!
Hey. Hey, kid.\nYou’re a Trainer, aren’t you?\c\nI bet you wouldn’t mind fulfilling the wishes of\nan alluring lady like myself, now would you?
Sure
I’m busy
This is ridiculous! Do your eyes work all right?\nHow can you pass by an alluring lady like me?!
Well, you can see my allure, of course.\nAnyone with eyes can.\c\nBut a woman can’t depend on such mature\nbeauty alone...\c\nShe must also have a cute side!\nA hint of charming sweetness!\c\nSo I’ve been thinking that I need to study that\nkind of cuteness from a cute Pokémon.
I’ve heard that there is a rather adorable\nPokémon called Drifloon in the Hau’oli Cemetery.\c\nDo you think you could catch one for me and\nregister it in your Pokédex?\c\nThey are round and soft and bob along as they\nmove... That sounds rather cute, doesn’t it?\c\nIf you keep your word and find one for me, then\nI’ll even pay you for the trouble, OK?
Catch me one of those round, soft Drifloon\nthat bob about in Hau’oli Cemetery, please!\c\nAnd beauty is fast to fade, so please be sure\nto find one in a hurry!
You’ve caught that Drifloon?\nWell then, show me your Pokédex!
Oh... Oh, no. This won’t work.\nIt’s cute, sure, but it’s a ghost or something...\c\nAnd they say it takes children off with it...\nI’m not interested in children. No thanks!
Well...this didn’t really work out the way that I\nhad hoped, but a promise is a promise.\c\nSo here is your pay for the work you did.
If I don’t figure out how to be adorable soon,\nI’ll have to learn how to dodder instead...
Hey, have you got a moment?\nYou live here in Alola, right?\c\nI’ve got a favor I’d like to ask. Do you mind?
No problem
I’m busy
Oh... Sorry, then.
Wow, thank you! I’m so glad that you would\nlisten to a request from a total stranger like me.\c\nI’m actually here in Alola with my darling hubby.\nIt’s our honeymoon!\c\nHe saw this Pokémon called Cutiefly on Route 3\nand it seems like my hubby was totally smitten\r\nwith it. We don’t have them back home, see.\c\nHe said it was too cute for words, with a yellow\nbody and a long, pointy proboscis!
Anyway, I wanted to ask if you could catch\none of those Cutiefly for me.\c\nIf I know what kind of Pokémon it is then I can\nprobably go and catch one myself.\c\nLike I said, I think that they’re somewhere on\nRoute 3.\c\nIf you catch one and come back to show me its\nPokédex entry, I can pay you for your trouble!
I guess you’ll be able to recognize Cutiefly by its\nyellow body and its long, pointy proboscis.\c\nI think he saw it on Route 3.
What? You’ve caught Cutiefly?\nThen would you mind showing me your ’Dex?
Hmm...\nSo it sucks up pollen and nectar from flowers\r\nusing that funny, long proboscis it has?\c\nIt is pretty cute! I wouldn’t mind one of these\nbuzzing around me!
Actually, I think I might want to get one of these\nCutiefly for myself now!\c\nLet me at least pay you like I promised first.\nThis is all I have, but it’s yours!
Thank you, young Trainer!\nI’ll go look for some Cutiefly at once!
You there! Trial-goer kid!\nI’m an old man and you’d better listen to me!
Sure
I’m busy
No! Don’t leave me here! Trial-goer kid!\nI’m so...so lonely...
I may not look like much now, but when I was a\nyoung lad, I was a captain, [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0403)]boygirl!\c\nEven now I feel my pulse speed up whenever\nI see a trial-goer!\c\nSo listen to this old man’s request.\nLet me send you out on a trial I designed myself!
Do you know the beach near the Hano Grand\nResort on Akala?\c\nThere’s a curious Pokémon that lives there.\nCalled Pyukumuku, it is.\c\nGo and register it in your Pokédex, then report\nback to me here!\c\nIf you clear this trial, I’ll have a reward for you!
Register one of those Pyukumuku that you find\non Hano Beach in your Pokédex for me!
You’ve caught a Pyukumuku?!\nLet me see that! Hand over that Pokédex!
Mm... Indeed you have!\c\nThis is one of the Pokémon that folks think of\nwhen they think of the Alola region, you know!\c\nWhat’s more charming than its protective\ncoating and its bold defense mechanism?
I don’t have a Z-Crystal to give to you, but here\nis your reward for clearing my trial!
The island challenge is a precious part of\nAlola’s culture! I’ll be praying for your success!
Um...excuse me, but...could I ask you something?
Sure
I’m busy
Oh, I see...\nSorry to bother you then...
Thank you for giving me some of your time.\c\nYou see, I’m doing a study about the effects of\nwater quality on Pokémon, and right now I am\r\nlooking into the situation in Brooklet Hill.\c\nI’m currently surveying whether a Pokémon\ncalled Feebas can be found living there.\c\nBut I’m terrible at fishing, and so I’m not making\nany progress at all...
Do you think I could offer you a bit of part-time\nwork as a research assistant?\c\nCould you try to catch a Feebas for me in\nBrooklet Hill?\c\nIt’s a rather shabby looking Pokémon, so I think\nyou’ll have no trouble recognizing it if you see it.\c\nIf you manage to catch one, please come and\nshow me your Pokédex data.\c\nI have enough budget to pay you, so please!
I need to see a Feebas from Brooklet Hill.\nPlease...help me out...
You’ve caught the Feebas?\nThen will you show me your Pokédex?
So there it is...\c\nFeebas really is a strong creature.\nIt can survive even in the most polluted water.\c\nSome researchers have hypothesized that it\nmay even dislike clean water, but if it lives in\r\nBrooklet Hill, then that is clearly not the case!
Thank you. You’ve been a great help!\nHere. For your assistance.
You’ve been a great help with my research.\nNow I should be able to make some progress!
Why, hello, Trainer.\nLooks like you’ve got a Pokédex on you.\c\nHow would you like to do a little part-time work\non behalf of the Aether Foundation?
Sure
I’m busy
Well, that is a shame.\nCome back if you ever have the time.
We at the Aether Foundation work to protect\nPokémon through conservation.\c\nIn order to protect Pokémon, though, we must\nknow a good deal about them and how they live.\c\nRight now, we are surveying the Stufful that\nlive on Route 8.\c\nThe foundation is collecting its own data, of\ncourse, but we would also like to know what\r\ndata the Pokédex records about them.
So your job, if you should choose to accept it,\nwould be to register the Stufful on Route 8 in\r\nyour Pokédex and then show us the data.\c\nWe will pay you for the work, of course.\nI hope you’ll help us out.
Please show us the data that your Pokédex\nrecords about the Stufful living on Route 8.\c\nIt is a very adorable Pokémon.\nI’m sure you’ll recognize it at once.
You’ve caught a Stufful?\nThen would you show me your Pokédex?
I see...\c\nThe biology of this Stufful is one that we hadn’t\nyet uncovered in our own research...\c\nThis is just the level of detail that I knew we\ncould expect from the Pokédex!
Thank you very much!\nHere is your pay.
Thank you for helping us with our research.\c\nI think we’ll have an even better understanding\nof Stufful thanks to this.
Hey! You!\nYou’ve got a Rotom Dex, haven’t you?\c\nThen I’ve got the perfect job for you!\nWhat do you say? Will you take me up on it?
Sure
I’m busy
Hrmmm. Well, that is a shame.\nIt was a pretty sweet offer, too...
I’m an employee of a place called the Aether\nFoundation.\c\nWe’re doing a survey right now of a Pokémon\ncalled Passimian, which lives in Lush Jungle.\c\nBut I’ve had no luck finding any of them, and\nI’m in a real tough spot now...
If you happen to catch a Passimian, would you\nshow me the data from your Pokédex?\c\nIf you help me out, I can pay you for your work!
Passimian live in Lush Jungle.\c\nIt’s a real dexterous one and handles Berries\nlike a pro. I think you’ll know it when you see it.
You caught a Passimian?\nThen will you show me your ’Dex?
So, that’s it...\c\nThere’re things here that we couldn’t figure out\nfrom the data the foundation had collected...
Thanks a lot! Here, this is for you!
Now we know a bit more about how Passimian\nlive out in nature.\c\nThanks for helping out with the Aether\nFoundation’s efforts!
Hey! You!\nYou’ve got a Rotom Dex, haven’t you?\c\nThen I’ve got the perfect job for you!\nWhat do you say? Will you take me up on it?
Sure
I’m busy
Hrmmm. Well, that is a shame.\nIt was a pretty sweet offer, too...
I’m an employee of a place called the Aether\nFoundation.\c\nWe’re doing a survey right now of a Pokémon\ncalled Oranguru, which lives in Lush Jungle.\c\nBut I’ve had no luck finding any of them, and\nI’m in a real tough spot now...
If you happen to catch an Oranguru, would you\nshow me the data from your Pokédex?\c\nIf you help me out, I can pay you for your work!
Oranguru live in Lush Jungle.\c\nIt looks kind of like an old man, all dressed in\nwhite. I think you’ll know it when you see it.
You caught an Oranguru?\nThen will you show me your ’Dex?
So, that’s it...\c\nThere’re things here that we couldn’t figure out\nfrom the data the foundation had collected...
Thanks a lot! Here, this is for you!
Now we know a bit more about how Oranguru\nlive out in nature.\c\nThanks for helping out with the Aether\nFoundation’s efforts!
Um, could I borrow a moment of your time?\nJust a moment, mind you.
Sure
I’m busy
O-oh... Of course. You’re busy.\nHow silly of me to try talking to you...
Th-thank you very much.\c\nYou see...I’ve fallen in love at first sight!\nWith a Pokémon called Togedemaru!\c\nI love it to bits... I love it so much that I can’t\nbear to even catch one for myself!\c\nSo I wanted to ask a favor...\nCould you catch a Togedemaru for me and then\r\nshow me its Pokédex entry so I can see it?
I think you’ll find some adorable Togedemaru\naround the power plant.\c\nIts pointed little needles are just so adorable\nthat I’m sure you’ll get it as soon as you see it.\c\nAnd I can promise to reward you if you do this\nfor me! So please!
I think you’ll find the adorable little Togedemaru\naround the power plant.\c\nIts pointed little needles are just so adorable\nthat I’m sure you’ll get it as soon as you see it.
What?! You actually caught a Togedemaru?!\nThe Pokédex! Give it here! At once!
Oooh... My little Togedemaru...\nHow adorable you are...\c\nI just want to feel your little needles tickling\nme all over...
Oh! This is the best! Just wonderful!\nHere is your payment, as promised!
I got to know my beloved Togedemaru even\nbetter than before!\c\nThank you for this! Have a wonderful journey!
You’re a Trainer, right?\nWanna do a little job for me?
Sure
I’m busy
Hmph. Fine then.\nIf you change your mind, though, come see me.
I’m looking for information about a Pokémon\ncalled Mimikyu.\c\nSo how about you go and catch a Mimikyu\nfor me?\c\nThen you can show me the data that your\nPokédex records for it, right?
It’s this odd little thing that looks like it’s got\na sack on its head. Lives at the site of the\r\nabandoned Thrifty Megamart. You know it?\c\nSo go find one for me. If you do a good job,\nI’ll even pay you for the trouble.
That Pikachu-looking Mimikyu should be\nhanging out in the abandoned Thrifty Megamart.\c\nGo catch one in a flash to get it registered in\nyour Pokédex, then come back to show me.
Caught that Mimikyu?\nThis must be my lucky day. Show me your ’Dex!
See that? It’s just like I said...\c\nIt’s gotta be a really scary Pokémon under that\ncloth, right? No one knows what’s in there...\c\nEven if it’s my job, they can’t just expect me\nto come survey scary ghost Pokémon like that!\c\nI’ll just copy the data from your Pokédex here,\nsubmit it to my boss, and call it a day.
Thanks a bunch, pal.\nNow I won’t get chewed out by my boss.\c\nTake your payment. No need to be shy about it.
I joined the Aether Foundation ’cause I thought\nthe uniforms were really cool looking, but...\c\nPokémon conservation and all is actually a lot\nmore hard work than I expected...\r\nIt’s no good just following a whim, you know?

No... That’s not it...\nIt’s all wrong...
Where is it?\nThe Pokémon that always protected me?\r\nThat round body... That rugged form...\r\nThose sharp, burning eyes...

Well, if you do decide you’d like to battle\nalongside Aerodactyl, come let me know!

But you don’t even have that much!\nAnd I’m not lowering the price, either.
Here you go! Your very own Shiny Stone!
There are Pokémon that can evolve if you use\nthat on them, but I don’t know which. See ya!

I’ve been waiting for you!\c\nNow let me explain about the Reassembly Unit.[VAR 0114(0026)]
Sina...\nYou don’t waste even a second.[VAR 0114(0027)]
Have you been collecting Zygarde’s Cells\nand Cores?[VAR 0114(0026)]
You’ve collected fewer than 10 Cells\nand Cores combined...[VAR 0114(0027)]
You’ve collected 10 or more Cells\nand Cores combined.[VAR 0114(0027)]
Anyway, I’ll explain![VAR 0114(0026)]
The Reassembly Unit is a device that has\nsomething to do with the Pokémon Zygarde.\c\nThe machine is capable of assembly and\nseparation of Zygarde.[VAR 0114(0026)]
Assembly is...to create a Pokémon\ncalled Zygarde!\c\nNow, Dexio, it’s your turn.[VAR 0114(0026)]
Oh...Sina, Sina, Sina...\nAnyway...\c\nThere are two ways to assemble Zygarde.\c\nOne is to add Cells you collected\nto Zygarde.[VAR 0114(0027)]
The other is to create a new Zygarde with\nonly Cells![VAR 0114(0026)]
Next we’ll explain about separation.[VAR 0114(0027)]
To separate Zygarde...\nit means to return Zygarde to its Cells![VAR 0114(0026)]
Separated Cells will be returned to the\nZygarde Cube.[VAR 0114(0027)]
For your information, according to the research\nby the professor who’s sent us to Alola,\r\nZygarde is divided into 100 Cells and Cores.[VAR 0114(0027)]
Depending on the number of Cells and Cores,\nthe shape of Zygarde will be different...\r\nIn other words, Zygarde changes its Forme![VAR 0114(0026)]
Zygarde is said to maintain the order of the\nKalos region...then why is it in Alola...?\c\nIs it a sign that something is about to happen?[VAR 0114(0027)]
If you collect Zygarde’s Cells and Cores, you\nmay get the answer. Anyhow...\c\nwe’ll be taking our leave now!\nBon voyage![VAR 0114(0026)]

Welcome to the Trainers’ School!\nI’m the principal.
What an honor for me and the school!\c\nTo think that our teachings would not only give\nrise to a captain but to a League Champion!
Despite your lofty accomplishments, though, I’d\nhazard that you still don’t know everything that\r\nthe Trainer School has to teach you, eh?\c\nThen allow me to give you a special, expert\nlesson from the principal herself!
Just as the saying goes, even the fool may\ngive the wise man good counsel if he listens.\c\nI may have lost, but heed my advice and use\nthis. It is one of my favorite items.
If your Pokémon is holding the King’s Rock, its\nattacks may make an opponent flinch.\c\nAnd that’s the end of what I can teach you.\nI’m glad I was able to meet you here.
If I can defeat h[VAR GENDBR(00FF,0202)]imer, then that will mean that our\nschool’s principal is stronger than a Champion.\c\nAnd even if I lose, we can still boast that we’re\nthe school who helped create a Champion.\c\nOh, it’s too good!

There’s no food left at all!
You devoured the Chansey omelette!
You chowed down on the Take Down steak! 
You made short work of the Miltank\ncheese pizza!
You sucked down the Hoenn ramen!
You scarfed down the Whirlpool sushi!
You inhaled the Vanillite parfait!
You gobbled up the Tamato pasta!
You feasted upon the Eggant in chili sauce!
You gorged on Rindo salad!

Oh ho ho ho!\nOh ho ho ho!
I am the buffet queen!\c\nThe empress ruling over all worldly buffets...
I have made my way through life\ndevouring all goodies in my path![VAR 0114(002D)]
I happened to see you eating the other day.[VAR 0114(002D)]
The way you eat is so cute and exciting!\nStay just the way you are! You’re fabulous![VAR 0114(002D)]
I mean... What I’m trying to say is...\nI think you’re just so lovely![VAR 0114(002D)]
I was hoping we could have a battle just once.[VAR 0114(002D)]
What do you say? Wouldn’t you like to see\nwhich of us is fit to be boss of the buffet? [VAR 0114(002D)]
All right, bring it on then!\nLet’s go grab a seat, shall we?[VAR 0114(002D)]
We’ll have 10 turns.\c\nGrab as many delicious goodies\nas you can in the allotted time.\r\nWhoever walks away with the fullest belly wins![VAR 0114(002D)]
Well then, let’s get this buffet battle started![VAR 0114(002D)]
What, are you too busy?\nFine. We don’t have to battle.[VAR 0114(002D)]
Come back when you feel like battling! If you\nkeep me waiting too long, I might lose interest![VAR 0114(002D)]
Oh, you came by to see me again!\nHow about it? Wanna battle me?[VAR 0114(002D)]
[~ 66]
[~ 67]
[~ 68]
Time’s up! The buffet is finished![VAR 0114(002D)]
OK, time to see who walked away from the\nbuffet more satisfied![VAR 0114(002D)]
My level of satisfaction is...[VAR 0114(002D)]
Mmmm! Delish! I’m pretty satisfied![VAR 0114(002D)]
How satisfied are you?[VAR 0114(002D)]
Hmmm...\nAs far as I can tell...[VAR 0114(002D)]
You look like someone who’s totally\nsatisfied by your belly full of delicious goodies![VAR 0114(002D)]
You look pretty full! You must be satisfied![VAR 0114(002D)]
What a stern look! Looks like you didn’t get\nenough to eat![VAR 0114(002D)]
You look terribly disappointed!\nLooks like your body and mind are still hungry![VAR 0114(002D)]
Well, the results are in! Looks like...[VAR 0114(002D)]
I’m the big winner! Oh ho ho ho![VAR 0114(002D)]
It’s a tie...I guess. That’s pretty cool...I suppose![VAR 0114(002D)]
Come back whenever you feel like battling!\nI’ll be ready and waiting for you![VAR 0114(002D)]
I’ll always be happy to take you on whenever\nyou like![VAR 0114(002D)]
[~ 84]
You won! No way! Ooh, I’m so mad![VAR 0114(002D)]
Thanks, though. That’s the first taste I’ve ever\nhad of defeat.\r\nKinda bitter, isn’t it?[VAR 0114(002D)]
Heehee. Way to go!\c\nI knew you could do it when I first laid eyes\non you![VAR 0114(002D)]
I have to give the title of buffet queen to\nyou now![VAR 0114(002D)]
From now on, you’re the new buffet queen![VAR 0114(002D)]
From now on, you’re the new buffet queen...[VAR 0114(002D)]
Oh, wait, no. You’re a boy, so you’ll be the\nbuffet king![VAR 0114(002D)]
Keep eating lots of delicious goodies\nso you can grow big and strong![VAR 0114(002D)]
Good-bye then. I hope we can meet\nagain someday.[VAR 0114(002D)]
What’s that? What am I going to do now?[VAR 0114(002D)]
Hehe. There’s a whole world of delicious\ngoodies out there you know nothing about!\r\nI’m gonna go eat ’em all up![VAR 0114(002D)]
Hmmph![VAR 0114(002D)]
To eat or not to eat?\nHmmm...\c\nAllow me to consult my stomach.
After consulting with my stomach,\nit seems that we’re fated to battle!
[~ 99]
What should I eat next?\nLet me know, stomach...
The food of commoners always looks so quaint.\c\nWo-wonderful!
You seem to have your eye on it, so it must be\ngood commoner food.\c\nI’ll be taking my share—all of it!
[~ 103]
What a quaint idea this “buffet” system is!\nI do enjoy being around you commoners!
*slurp*
Heh. Looks tasty, doesn’t it? That’s because I\nmade it all!\c\nI take the responsibility of tasting everything\nvery seriously!
[~ 107]
I became a Cook because I love food, but all I do\nis cook, not eat! It’s really frustrating...
What sort of cuisine do they serve here?
Ooh, so before we partake of the main course,\nwe can start off with an appetizer of a\r\nPokémon battle!
[~ 111]
There are many kinds of cuisine in the world.
Hi-yah! I need all the nutrients I can get\nbefore I head to the mountains for my training!
You have to fight if you want to eat! In other\nwords, welcome to the Battle Buffet!
[~ 115]
The sadness of being unable to eat what I want\nis intense. If I can get over it, I’ll become\r\neven stronger!
Strong Trainers gather to eat popular dishes...\nThis is going to take some skills!
I’m normally just a Pokémon Breeder!\c\nHere at the buffet I become a warrior loyal only\nto my appetite!
[~ 119]
I’m the type who gets all excited when\nI’m hungry.
Eating is truly the greatest pleasure we have\nin life! You’ll understand when you get older.
I feel like if I can just eat this delicious food,\nmy meeting will go better!
[~ 123]
Ah, who cares about my boss?\c\nIf I don’t get something good to eat,\nI don’t think I can take it anymore!
Don’t worry about me. I’m just looking.\nNo, really, I’m just looking.
Hang on a second! I can’t help it!\nI do want to eat after all!
[~ 127]
What do you think of girls who eat a lot?
Only the strong can eat! Muwuhahaha!\nSounds like my kind of place!
Your food is my food now!\nAnd I’m about to devour my food!
[~ 131]
No food for the weak...\nAnd I thought this was my kind of place...
I’m gonna fill up on some tasty food.\nIt might be tough...
What do you think you’re doing?!\c\nI saw it first! You think I’m\ngonna just let you take it?!
[~ 135]
They always have plenty of\ndishes no one likes left over...
I’m no Youngster!\nI’m a starving monster!
My favorite things, huh? That’s easy!\nTasty treats and Pokémon battles!
[~ 139]
I guess Youngsters can’t\nactually become monsters...
The law of the jungle is the only rule here\nat the Battle Buffet!
Hey, stop that! That’s mine!\nI told you, it’s the law of the jungle!
[~ 143]
I thought it had something\nto do with a jungle gym...
For this amount of food...\nand these ingredients...\c\nLet me see...\nAccording to my calculations...
OK! This dish will be indispensable\nif I want to get my money’s worth!
[~ 147]
What a fool I was...\nCalories had nothing to do with it...
I like this tense atmosphere.\c\nTo eat is to live, so everyone here is so serious.
Hey, if you can beat me,\ndo you want me to feed you?
[~ 151]
Open up, here it comes!
I can keep going.\nI can still eat more...\c\nI’ve got to eat a ton to make this worth it!
Whether you get to eat or not,\nit’s $1,200!\c\nIf that’s the case, I’ve got no choice but to eat!
[~ 155]
Your Pokémon and your appetite sure\nare healthy!
Dine here
Hear the explanation
Come back later
I’ll have some!

Ooh, it all looks so delish! What should I eat?[VAR 0114(002D)]

If you leave partway through, you’ll lose all the\ndishes you’ve already gotten. Is that OK?
Please continue enjoying the Battle Buffet.
Oh, do my eyes deceive me, or are you\nour Champion?
I knew it! Thank you so much for\ncoming, Champion!\c\nAllow me to show you to a seat worthy of\nsomeone of your status!

A Fossil captures our past, fossilized forever!\nIt’s too valuable to be discounted for a pauper!
This is a rare find that the store’s owner, Olivia,\nbrought all the way from the Sinnoh region to\r\nhelp the spread of Fossil Pokémon.\c\nIt is a Fossil of the sturdy Head Butt Pokémon,\nwhich used its hard head to attack in battle.\c\nIt’s very precious, so be sure to take care of it.

Hello, darling...\c\nI brought you some flowers today.
Hyah!
Hyah! Hyah!
...What do you think, darling?\nThey are lovely, aren’t they?
Hyah! Hiii-yah!\nHyah! Hyah!
Shhh, quiet now.\c\nThere are many others resting in these plots.
Hiii-yah! Hyah hyah hyah!
Come now, dry those tears.\nWe’re all done with tears, aren’t we? You and I.\c\nIf we come here, we can see him again any\ntime that we want to.\c\nAnd as long as we don’t forget him, he will\nalways be with us...
Hyah...
Hyah?!
Oh! Hello, young Trainer.\nI’m sorry for all of this one’s noise.
Hyah!
This is my husband’s grave.\nAnd this silly one here was his Pokémon.
Hyah! Hyah! Hiiii-yah!
It was...an accident.\c\nBut my husband sent Machamp back into its\nball at the moment of the crash.\r\nIt was a miracle that Machamp survived.\r\nBut my husband...\c\nWell, ever since the accident, Machamp here\nhas hated being inside a Poké Ball.\r\nIn fact it flung its own ball off somewhere.
Hi-yaaaaaahhh!
Of course I was devastated when my husband\npassed away.\c\nAnd there were times when I hated that other\nman, who caused the accident.\c\nBut that man...\nHe had a family, too. A young wife.\c\nWhen I saw her face, I just couldn’t go on hating\nanyone for what happened.
Oh, I’m sorry...\nI didn’t mean to say all that...
Thank you for letting an old woman ramble so.\c\nThis belonged to my husband, but I’d be happy\nif you could use it.
Do you also use Ride Pokémon to get around?\c\nIt is fun and quite convenient, but please do\nbe careful not to get in any accidents.\c\nTake care, young Trainer.
Good night for today, darling...\nWe’ll come visit again tomorrow night.

Are you out and about on your island challenge?\nWhen you’ve completed it, come on back.\r\nDon’t forget about me here, OK?
That [VAR PKNAME(0000)] of yours...\nI don’t know why, but it sure takes me back!
You know Mankey, right?\nI’m actually the one who came up with it!\c\nThe boss told me to make a Pokémon with a bit\nof this and a bit of that, and that’s what I drew!\c\nI’m pretty fond of it myself!
You know, I thought up the Pokémon moves\nmyself and programmed ’em in myself, too.\c\nSo I never really wrote down the details or\nanything. Sorry about that...
We had a poll in the company once a long time\nago to see which Pokémon was most popular...\c\nand back then the winner was Exeggutor!
Tauros used to be real strong, huh?\c\nI was the one who thought up that one.\nBut Blizzard was a bit too strong, eh?
You know Diglett, right?\c\nIt’s actually basically just a character that I\nhad made up when I was a little kid.\r\nI even drew up a flip-book featuring it then!
You know Mew, right?\c\nI made it. Everything about it. The pixel art,\nits cry, its Pokédex entry, everything.\c\nI just barely finished in time, too! It was right at\nthe very end of the game’s development!
Can I tell you a little something, just between\nyou and me?\c\nSee, the Japanese version of Pokémon Blue was\nan exclusive release when it first came out.\r\nOnly certain people could get it.\c\nFrom what I heard, that was a real pain for the\npeople working in the shops that sold it...
We were all young folks in the office back when\nwe first made Pokémon Blue to be sold in Japan.\c\nNow we’re all a bunch of middle-aged coots.
Back in the day, the programming used up all\nthe space on a cartridge, so if we wanted to\r\nadd something new, we had to clean it up first...\c\nFirst we’d find enough space, then we could\nmake what we wanted... It was a pain!
In that one game, you could talk to the Pokémon\nfollowing you to find out how it was doing.\r\nI was the one who came up with that idea!
I heard something from Masuda one time...\c\nApparently the sound that plays when you save\nis different in each version...\c\nI gotta tell you...I can’t tell any difference at all!
Just between you and me, but...\c\nWhen we were working on these new titles once,\nI got told to come up with version differences...\r\nBoy, I was gobsmacked!\c\nBut in the end, I’m glad I helped make them.
Your lead Pokémon’s Nature is [VAR ITEM1(0001)].\nThat means its Attack stat will grow easily.\c\nMy explanation could grow pretty easily, too,\nbut I’ll keep it short and sweet for you.

I’d say I’m pretty up to speed on Pokémon\nbattling. What do you think?\r\nWant to battle me? I’m really good, you know?
Let’s battle
Let’s not
Whoops! I forgot to save before the battle...\nbut I’m going to win anyway, so it’s fine.
Oh yeah? Well, that’s a real shame.\nI’m really good, after all.
You’re really good, too.\nAfter all, you managed to beat me.\r\nYou can brag about it, if you want.\c\nHere, I’ll even heal up your Pokémon since you\ndared to take me on in battle.
I’ll let you fight me again sometime, if you want.\nJust once a day, though, OK?\c\nSo come back tomorrow.\nThough I’ll probably have forgotten you already.
I’m not gonna fight you again today.\nYou’ve got to come back tomorrow.
Oh, you’re a player!\nWe’ve been making games here.\r\nWhat color would you choose?
Red
Green
Blue
Yellow
Red, huh? Interesting!\nI’d say you’re probably the type who stays\r\ntrue to your heart and says what you want.
Green, huh? Interesting!\nI’d say you’re pretty dedicated to our game,\r\nthen. Are you a fanatic, maybe?
Blue, huh? Interesting!\nI’d say you’re probably the type who does what\r\nyou want, even if it’s not the popular thing.
Pi! Pikachu!\nPika pika chu!
Clefairy is the cutest, isn’t it?\nOooh, I just want to hug it!
Ciao!\nI just finished an awesome song!
Being able to finally work on the games that I\nspent so long playing... It’s a dream come true!
I want to keep working on the game, so I’ve got\nto keep my energy up! I need some vitamins!\c\nHere, I’ll give you one, too!\nThanks for stopping by!

You know me?
I thought you must be.
From my son.
Guzma has actually come home a few times\nsince...all that.\c\nAnd he told me to give you this if you ever\ncame by.
It was always one of his favorite TMs.\c\nHe won so many trophies when he entered\nbattle competitions with the Pokémon that\r\nhe’d taught to use Swagger.
I know that there were a lot of rumors flying\naround, saying that our Guzma was up to no\r\ngood and doing terrible things...\c\nbut I know it was all just lies.

There you are!
...Mmm.
This fellow here’s my partner, Gru the Oranguru.\c\nBut he just hasn’t really taken a liking to me.\nMaybe he hasn’t known me long enough yet.\c\nHe often gets out on his own like this.\nI don’t know, maybe he feels stressed?
Mmph.
Did he maybe give you something?
Let me remind you that lying to an officer is an\noffense! I could have you up on charges!\c\nSo let me ask you one more time...
Ohhh, Gru...!\nThat was locked up in our safe!\c\nOranguru are clever Pokémon, so I’m sure Gru\nhere had no problem getting the safe open.
Mmm.
Sigh... Fine.\c\nYou take it then.\nUse it however you’d like.
Mmm.
I guess Gru must’ve gotten this nasty habit of\nlifting things from his old Trainer.\r\nSmart as a whip, but real sticky fingers.\c\nIt makes him a handful to control, but it’s not\nlike I can just ignore him till his old Trainer\r\ngets out of jail and comes back for him, right?\c\nSorry for complaining to you about my problems.\nHere, take this and be on your way.
And don’t feel like you’ve got to pay me back in\nkind for that Return.\c\nFavors don’t always need returning.\nThat’s not why I’m doing any of this.\c\nI just hope this fellow here can straighten out\nbefore his old Trainer gets back.

I came all the way from Johto to visit Alola.\nIs it true you can’t use Fly to fly around here?
I don’t know. Is it?
Yes, it is
Seems like! I got told off for trying it!\nThey said it was some kind of law or something!\c\nBut then how do folks in Alola fly around?
Wow... So it’s really a thing?\nThis really is a whole different region.\c\nBut then how do folks in Alola fly around?
On Charizard
With a Ride Pager
Wow... So everyone just rides around on special\nCharizard that’ve been raised for the job?\c\nSounds weird, if you ask me, but I’ve gotta admit\nthat riding on a Charizard would be a blast!
Ho, so that’s how it works, huh?\nSpecial gear that can call Pokémon?\c\nI’d heard that Alola had a great transportation\nsystem, but it’s really true, huh?
Thanks for teaching me about how things are\nhere in Alola.\c\nHere, you might as well have this!
Back where I’m from, in Johto, this kind of TM\nis a real big deal.\c\nThey’re called Hidden Machines, or HMs,\nbecause they’re so hard to get your hands on.\c\nBut here I guess it’s just another TM.\nMaybe you can use it in battle or something!
The way people live can be different depending\non where they live.\c\nThe value of things also depends on where you\nhappen to be.\c\nOne of the best things about traveling is getting\nto feel and understand that up close.

Hiii there. ♪ Yes, you. ♪\nWe’re the Hidden Maidens! ♪
See we’re, like, here in Alola for a shoot. ♪
But we’re taking all the shots ourselves. ♪\nWe don’t have a cameraman. ♪
We don’t have an agent or anyone to help us,\nbut we’re going to be big someday, soon. ♪
That’s why we need your help, stranger. ♪\nWe need shots for our PV.\c\nA promotional video for our work. ♪
We were thinking, like, maybe a Multi Battle. ♪\c\nThere’d be this big, bad Trainer who is so, so\nmean to the poor Hidden Maidens... ♪\c\nAnd we’d be all cute and, like, “Oh no!” ♪
So could you take us on in a Multi Battle? ♪
No way
Sure
Awww...\nIf you ever come around, we’ll be here. ♪\c\nAnd of course we’ll give you a reward if you\ncan help us get some, like, savage shots. ♪
Yaaas! ♪ I, like, totally love you right now. ♪\nLet’s do it. ♪
Um, you do know that there’s, like, a certain\nnumber of Pokémon you need for Multi Battles?
OK, Scene 1...\c\nThe Hidden Maidens run into some trouble at\nthe beach! ♪\c\nAnd...action! ♪
That’s a cut! ♪\nThat was so savage!
We’re going to have the best photos. ♪\nWe really owe you this time. ♪
Here. Take these as your, like, reward. ♪\nUse them every day and think of us,\r\nthe HMs! ♪
We call these Hidden Machines where we’re\nfrom, get it? ♪
Truth is we’ve got our own hidden sides, yeah?\c\nMaybe we’re, like, high key stars, but we’re\nlow key HM makers.\c\nNo, seriously, we make Hidden Machines.
Yeah, we’re like national treasures back in the\nKalos region because of our HM skills. ♪\c\nBut there’s no money to be made in making HMs.\nYou can’t even sell them!
But we heard that people don’t need HMs\nhere in Alola, so we figured...\c\nLike, maybe we could sell them here as regular\nold TMs, right?
And we thought we could sell tons of them if we\nmarket them ourselves, since we’re so cute! ♪
Surf and Waterfall are both super strong TMs!\c\nYou should, like, at least try teaching them\nto one of your Water Pokémon pals.
It’ll be savage. ♪\nThanks again for your help! ♪
You’d better stay our fan!\nDon’t forget your Hidden Maidens! ♪

Wh-what the heck you think you’re doing, huh?!\nDid someone say you could come in here?!\c\nN-not that I’m doing anything in here!\nI haven’t done nothing! You wanna scrap?!

There is something written on his chest...\c\n“I’m just a poor Hypno.\nShare some love.”\c\nThe eerie Hypno keeps on staring at you...
Ignore him
Give him $1
Give him $100
Give him $1,000
Bah!
Hmph!
Zzz.
Wowzers!\nYou’re really giving me this?!
It looked like a Hypno, but it’s actually just a\nperson wearing a Pokémon costume...
Look at you, big spender!\nI figured someone might give me money if only I\r\npretended to be a Pokémon, but I had no luck...\r\nuntil now, that is!\c\nYou’re the first big donor I’ve had!\nA shining example of humanity!\c\nI’m so touched that I’ve got to do something\nto pay you back for this. Here, take this!
Rest seems like a good move for a Hypno, right?\c\nI won’t give you back your money, of course,\nbut I’d be happy to let you have that!
Now, I guess I’d better get back to work!\c\nI can’t get anything if my cover is blown, so\ndon’t you talk to me no more either!

I heard that other regions have these “Pokémon\nDay Care” places...\c\nApparently you can leave Pokémon there, and\nthey’ll raise your Pokémon for you.
We’ve got nurseries here in Alola, but all we\ndo is hold on to your Pokémon for you.\c\nWe don’t help them get stronger or learn any\nmoves, but I’d guess we’re easier on your wallet!
Oh, and there is something else!\nIf you leave two Pokémon together at the\r\nnursery, you sometimes end up finding an Egg!\c\nSince we’re talking about it, do you want one of\nthe Eggs I found here at the nursery recently?
Thanks for taking it off my hands!\c\nAnd don’t go trying to crack it just because you\ncan’t wait to see what’s inside!\c\nThough I’ve never heard of a Pokémon Egg\ncracking except when it’s ready to hatch.
Oh, yeah? Well, I’ll hold on to it for now, but if\nyou change your mind, this Egg can be yours!
Do you want one of the Eggs I found here at the\nnursery recently?
If you carry a Pokémon Egg around with you,\nit will hatch into a Pokémon.\c\nI bet it must feel pretty happy being surrounded\nby your team, even before it’s born.
Whoa! You can’t even take an Egg?!\nHow many Pokémon have you caught?!\c\nI guess I’ll hold on to it for now, but it’s yours\nif you ever want it.

Would you just look at those biceps!\nThey’re bulging with strength!\r\nThey’re practically big enough to burst!
Can you even imagine how far you’d be able\nto drive a golf ball with muscles like those?!
Mah...
The Machamp seems uncomfortable...\c\nShould you stop them?\nYou’ll probably get dragged into a battle...
Stop them
Let them be
Uh, excuse you?\nWhat do you think you’re doing?\c\nWe hired this big fella to be our caddy.\c\nAnd we’re in the middle of something important\nright now, so how about you get out of my grill?
Yeah, just get lost, would you?
Are you even serious about this?\nYou’ve only got one Pokémon that can fight!\c\nThere’s no point in even battling someone like\nyou!
What is up with you...
I know, right? Just totally killed the mood.\nLet’s just go...
Geez, you little...\c\nWhat was that, huh?\nYou trying to be a hero or something?\c\nWhat’d you go and do that for, huh?\c\nI’m not a Pokémon...\nI’m a born-and-bred human being, duh!\c\nThis is just a costume!
Like, seriously, [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0404)]dudelady...\nAre you just here to ruin my day?\c\nGoing and blowing all the hard work that I put\ninto disguising myself as a Machamp caddy...\c\nI was going to make some real bank off this job!\c\nAnd then...you had to come along and try to\n“rescue” me...\c\nMan, I want to cry right now...\nBut I know you were just trying to help.\c\nI can’t get mad for what you did...\nSo here... Just take this...
Now get lost...\nAnd don’t you talk to me again...
Mah...\n(I told you not to talk to me...)

Hey. I’d like to say welcome to my shop,\nbut I’m afraid I just can’t do that right now.
Peli peli!
That fellow is my partner.\nPelly the Pelipper.\c\nHe helps me out with making deliveries, using\nthat big old beak and that throat pouch of his.
Peli peli.
I normally travel around the islands, dealing my\nwares wherever I come ashore.\c\nBut I’ve been here at Poni for quite a while now,\nand my supplies have pretty much run dry.
I’m in a real slump, and Pelly here is pretty much\ncrying out in boredom.
... ... ...
Hey! You’re supposed to be crying out, I said!\nWhat kind of partner are you?!
... ... ...
Why you...
Anyway, I do appreciate you taking the time\nto stop by anyway, so I hope you’ll take these.
Those two are real valuable power boosters!
I know it’s a generous gift, but that’s just who\nI am! Right, Pelly?\c\nPelly?
... ... ...
Come on! Throw me a bone here, Pelly!\nI thought you were my partner!
I really should be heading out onto the waves\nagain soon, but it’s so nice around here.\c\nWe seafolk and our chief and even me, we all\ncouldn’t seem to help but fall in love with Poni.

...Oh. Hello?\nWho are you?
I’m [VAR TRNAME(0000)]
I’m Kiawe’s friend
Oh, sure! I remember now.\nSorry, I’m no good with names.
...You sure about that?\nHow long have you known him then, hm?\c\nGa ha ha! I’m just joshing you, kid.\nI like to see a kid with confidence.\c\nBut I think I know who you really are.\nYou’re [VAR TRNAME(0000)], ain’t you?
I’m Kiawe’s old man.\nI’m glad he’s made friends like you.\c\nYou’re the first-ever Champion in Alola,\nain’t you?\c\nAnd at that tender age even!\nThat’s quite the accomplishment, kid.
I reckon I ought to give you a little gift to help\nyou celebrate becoming Champion, then.
Give that there to a Rhydon to hold, and then\ntrade it with a friend. You’ll see what happens.\c\nCourse there are no Rhydon native to Alola, but\nif you ever find one, give it a try for me, eh?
That boy of mine was pretty happy to hear that\nyou’d become Champion like that.\c\nI hope you’ll stay friends with him. He may not\nlook it, but he’s always been a lonely child.

If you want to know about the weather, you’re\nin the right place! This is the Weather Class!
But you’re a Pokémon Trainer, aren’t you?\c\nThen how about a quiz that takes weather into\nthe arena of Pokémon battles?\c\nIt will take a bit longer doing it like this, but I’ll\ngive you a reward if you can keep up!
It looks like you have what it takes.\nThen tell me, my good Trainer...\c\nWhich item would you have a Pokémon hold\nif you want Rain Dance to last a long time?
That’s it! Correct!\c\nIf a Pokémon holding a Damp Rock uses Rain\nDance, the rain will keep falling for eight turns!\c\nBut I’m not beaten yet!\nNext question!
Oooh, that’s a shame...\nThe correct answer was the Damp Rock.\c\nIf a Pokémon holding a Damp Rock uses Rain\nDance, the rain will keep falling for eight turns.\c\nBut I suppose everyone makes mistakes...\nLet’s move on to the next question!
Which item would you have a Pokémon hold\nif you want Hail to last a long time?
That’s it! Correct!\c\nIf a Pokémon holding an Icy Rock uses Hail,\nthe hail will keep falling for eight whole turns!\c\nBut I’ve still got some HP in me!\nNext question!
Oooh, that’s a shame...\nThe correct answer was the Icy Rock.\c\nIf a Pokémon holding an Icy Rock uses Hail,\nthe hail will keep on falling for eight turns.\c\nBut I suppose everyone makes mistakes...\nLet’s move on to the next question!
Which item would you have a Pokémon hold\nif you want sunshine that goes on for ages?
That’s it! Correct!\c\nIf a Pokémon holding a Heat Rock uses Sunny\nDay, the sun will shine forth for eight turns!\c\nBut I’m still in this match!\nNext question!
Oooh, that’s a shame...\nThe correct answer was the Heat Rock.\c\nIf a Pokémon holding a Heat Rock uses Sunny\nDay, the sun will shine forth for eight turns.\c\nBut I suppose everyone makes mistakes...\nLet’s move on to the next question!
Which item would you have a Pokémon hold\nif you want a sandstorm to last a long time?
That’s it! Correct!\c\nIf a Pokémon holding a Smooth Rock uses\nSandstorm, the storm will rage for eight turns!
Oooh, that’s a shame...\nThe correct answer was the Smooth Rock.\c\nIf a Pokémon holding a Smooth Rock uses\nSandstorm, the storm will rage for eight turns!
The most important part of any education is\nputting it to work in the real world.\c\nIt’s not enough to understand it in your head.\nYou’ve got to know it in your bones!\c\nThat’s why I’ll give you this set of rocks I’ve\ncollected for your own use.
There are lots of ways to use the weather to\nyour advantage in battles, so give it a try.\c\nLike you could use rain to power up your\nWater-type moves or to weaken the Fire-type\r\nmoves someone might use against you.\c\nOr you could call a sandstorm to deal damage\nevery turn to any Pokémon that isn’t a Rock,\r\nGround, or Steel type.
An Icy Rock
A Smooth Rock
A Heat Rock
A Damp Rock

Welcome to the Thrifty Megamart!\nThanks for choosing the Thrifty Megamart!
...Hold on a second there, pal.\c\nYou look to me like a kid...\c\nbuuut I can tell just by looking at you that you’re\na pretty decent Trainer.\c\nSure, I’m just a part-time worker now, pounding\naway at the register with a smile on my face,\r\nbut once I was a Trainer, traveling around on\r\nmy island challenge, too.
I even made a pretty fair name for myself.\nKagetora the Eevee User, that was me.\c\nBut then I got a wife, and then I had a kid...\nNow I face a new trial called a mortgage.\c\nAnd I work here to prepare me for the most\ngrand trial of all: old age and retirement!
...But never mind all that.\c\nLook, there’s something I’d like to ask an able\nyoung Trainer like you to do for me.\c\nBack in my heyday, there were these eight older\nTrainers I was always trying to beat.\c\nThey all used Pokémon that evolve from Eevee.\c\nHow would you feel about taking them on?\c\nIf you say that Kagetora sent you, I’m sure\nthey’ll agree to a battle.
If you can beat them all for me, I’ll have\nsomething to give you. It’ll be worth it.\c\nSo just ask me if you want to know more about\nany of ’em.
Oh, it’s you again.\c\nSo how’s that favor coming along?\nNeed me to tell you about an opponent?
The Vaporeon User
The Flareon User
The Jolteon User
The Espeon User
The Umbreon User
The Glaceon User
The Leafeon User
The Sylveon User
No, I’m good
The Vaporeon User, Polly...\nThey called her the Wild Whirlpool of Alola.\c\nShe was a cool drink of water, all right.\nA bikini-clad beauty who beat all the boys.\c\nHer Vaporeon’s Hydro Pump could blast through\nsolid steel plating...\c\nShe was from Melemele originally, and I think\nshe trained to be a teacher...\c\nIt’s been 30 years since I last saw her, but I\nhope that’ll be enough to find her.
The fiery magician, brimming with life...\nChad the Flareon User.\c\nHis temper burned as hot as any flame, and he\nwas always quick to find a fight.\c\nHis Flareon’s fire attacks were relentless, going\nafter opponents like a living thing.\c\nI know he always stayed at the Tide Song Hotel\nback in those days...\c\nIt’s been 30 years since I last saw him, but I\nhope that’ll be enough to find him.
Oh yes. The electrifying ball of energy that was\nJane the Jolteon User...\c\nShe looked like a lovely young Lass, but beneath\nthat sweet face was the heart of a tyrant...\c\nHer Jolteon slammed into opponents like a bolt\nof lightning from a blue sky...\c\nLast I heard, she was working somewhere\non Ula’ula Island...\c\nIt’s been 30 years since I last saw her, but I\nhope that’ll be enough to find her.
The Espeon User, Ishaan...\nThe sun itself was charmed by his sweet looks.\c\nHis Espeon danced past enemy attacks, letting\nthem slide right off it like some kinda miracle.\c\nIshaan worked at the Geothermal Power Plant\nback in those days, but now...\c\nIt’s been 30 years since I last saw him, but I\nhope that’ll be enough to find him.
The immortal ruler of the night...\nBraiden the Umbreon User.\c\nThe rumors say that he died once and came\nback to life. Everyone was afraid of him.\c\nHis Umbreon gave off its horrifying aura all the\ntime and never let up...\c\nHe used to hold some kind of ceremony in the\ncemetery on Melemele Island every night...\c\nIt’s been 30 years since I last saw him, but I\nhope that’ll be enough to find him.
Miss Absolute Zero...\nRea the Glaceon User.\c\nThat cool beauty seemed to have a soul of ice\nwhen she mercilessly pursued her opponents.\c\nEven time froze around her Glaceon!\c\nI know that she originally came from some small\nvillage on Melemele Island...\c\nIt’s been 30 years since I last saw her, but I\nhope that’ll be enough to find her.
A goddess of beauty in full bloom...\nLinnea the Leafeon User.\c\nShe was a world-famous model and a powerful\nGrass-type Pokémon user.\c\nWhen her Leafeon cried out, even withered and\ndead trees burst into bloom once more...\c\nShe used to always stay at the Hano Grand\nResort when she was between gigs...\c\nIt’s been 30 years since I last saw her, but I\nhope that’ll be enough to find her.
The queen of Fairy Pokémon...\nYes, Sakura the Sylveon User.\c\nThat pure young maiden was adored by Fairy-\ntype Pokémon, who saw her as a queen.\c\nEven wild beasts were captivated when her\nSylveon appeared before them...\c\nI heard that she was a descendant of the\nnomadic seafolk...\c\nThat’s the best hint I can give you to find her.
Got it.\nRemember, I’m counting on you, kid.
Oh, it’s you.\c\nWait, what?! You beat them all?!\nWhat happened then?!
... ...\n... ...\c\nTime truly is cruel to us all, isn’t it?\c\nFine then. I’m ready now.
I have one last favor to ask of you.\nWould you let me have a battle?
Of course
Hold on
If I do this, I think I’ll be ready...to let go.
I understand... I’ll wait.
Enough. It’s enough.\nOur day has come...and it has gone.\c\nBut I haven’t forgotten your reward.\nHere. I want you to take this.
I used that crystal back when I was a young\nTrainer, but I don’t need it now.\c\nYou use it and you build a new age.\c\nI’ll stay here and take care of the mortgage and\nthe old age.
You’re not one of the students, are you?\nWhat do you want from an old cleaning lady?
Are you the Vaporeon User?
It’s nothing...
...Well, yes, I suppose I am.\c\nWhat’s that? Kagetora sent you to battle me?\c\nI don’t mind. But no complaints out of you for\nhaving to take on this bent old woman!
Every rain cloud has its end...\nAnd no one can win against time’s march.\c\nNow I’m retired from training, and I spend my\ndays with Vaporeon cleaning these windows.\c\nBut how is that boy Kagetora doing?\nIs he well?
...Yes? What is it?\nDo you need something from me?
Are you the Flareon User?
It’s nothing...
Oh...\nAh...\c\nI see...\nSo you know Kagetora?\c\nYou would like a Pokémon battle from me?\nHow...nostalgic. It’s been quite some time.
A fire needs fuel to keep on burning.\nBut once the fuel is burnt up, only ash remains.\c\nMy working life is over. I’ve reached retirement.\nAll that is left of my life is the ashes.\c\nMe and Flareon are done with battling.\nI’d rather just go to lomi lomi and relax.
Ya-a-awn...\nThe old eyes are getting tired...
Are you the Jolteon User?
It’s nothing...
...Why, yes, I suppose I am. I’m Jane.\c\nEevee? Kagetora?\nI’m sorry, child. I don’t remember them...\c\nI do remember Pokémon battles, though...\nThough I’m not sure if I’m still up to one...
When lightning strikes the earth, it is swallowed\nup...and it disappears.\c\nEven if you try to whip an old body into action,\nthere are simply limits to what it can do.\c\nAnd besides...I really don’t remember anyone\ncalled Kagetora.
I suppose I should be moving...\nI’ll need to fix Espeon some supper...
Are you the Espeon User?
It’s nothing...
Why, that’s a question I haven’t heard in many\nlong years. I am Ishaan, if that’s what you mean.\c\nKagetora?\c\nOh! Oh yes! I remember that boy!\nNow that is a tale that takes me back...\c\nAnd you want to have a battle with me?\c\nI suppose I could, but please keep in mind\nthat I am an old man.
Even the sun itself, who rises with such glory\nin the morning, must eventually set.\c\nSo it is for human life, and I think...\nI think that I see the moon rising on the horizon.\c\nBut what about that Kagetora?\nHe’s not that much younger than me...\c\nDo tell him I said hello.
I suppose that’s enough for today...\c\nI’d better hurry home or that son of mine will\ngo berating me again for wandering off...
Are you the Umbreon User?
It’s nothing...
...That tale is decades old by now.\nHow old are you, [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0403)]boygirl?\c\nWell, you’re not wrong.\nI was once known as Braiden the Umbreon User.\c\nAnd you know young Kagetora?\nHow is that little whippersnapper?\c\nSure, I don’t mind battling with you...\nThough I’m due to check in to the hospital soon.
No night can ever be endless.\nDawn comes and snatches away the dark.\c\nI feel that light creeping into my life, blotting\nout the stars and stealing away the night.\c\nPeople used to talk about me once.\nSaid I was immortal and such nonsense.\r\nI was just in the hospital a long while, that’s all.\r\nBut human life does end.\r\nAnyway...you give Kagetora my regards.
It’s about time for my appointment with\nthe beautician...
Are you the Leafeon User?
It’s nothing...
W-well...yes, I suppose I am.\nWho might you be, child?\c\nOh! A friend of sweet little Kagetora’s?\c\nOf course I’d be delighted to battle you!\nI still have some spirit left in me!
The flower that blooms will wilt and fall.\nThe stalk will wither and return to the earth.\c\nBut not for Leafeon and me!\nWe refuse to accept such a reality.\c\nI will do everything that money and medicine\ncan do to keep my looks!\c\nBut my bones can’t help telling the truth.\nAt any rate, do say hello to Kagetora for me.
When is that grandson of mine coming home?
Are you the Glaceon User?
It’s nothing...
Well... I am Rea, who used to always use\na Glaceon in battle.\c\nYou’re friends with that Kagetora?\c\nSure, I’ll battle you.\nI’ll get it over with in no time, don’t you worry.
Even the drifting snow will melt away.\c\nThe only thing I want out of life now is to spend\nas much time as I can with my grandchildren.\c\nYou tell Kagetora that’s my biggest worry now.\nI don’t want him sending more Trainers after me.
Then I’ve got to go and get Sylveon some snacks\nat the malasada shop...and...
Are you the Sylveon User?
It’s nothing...
...You’re looking for the Sylveon User Sakura?\nThat’s my grandma!\c\nAnd that Kagetora guy asked you to come\nvisit her?\c\nBut my grandma died last year, you know?\c\nOh, I know!\c\nHere, I keep Sylveon now, so how about I battle\nyou instead!
The sweetest part of life is when you’re cute.\nBut the sweetest part is also the shortest.\c\nThat’s what my grandma told me.\c\nMaybe you can tell that to your Mr. Kagetora\nor whomever!
Welcome to the Thrifty Megamart!\nThanks for choosing the Thrifty Megamart!\c\nHmm. You look like a Trainer, but I can tell that\nyou’re still just getting started.\c\nIf you can become the strongest Trainer in all\nAlola, why don’t you come talk to me again?

Lomi lomi is the style of massage we practice\nhere in Alola.\r\nHow about a treatment for your Pokémon?\r\nIt will make them feel more friendly toward you.\c\nWhat do you say? Can I do a little lomi lomi on\nthat [VAR PKNAME(0000)] you have there?
If you ever want to experience the joys of\nlomi lomi massage, just stop by our shop here.
Then allow me to just take [VAR PKNAME(0000)]\nthere for a moment...
[~ 3]
There we go!\c\nIt was a really productive session of lomi lomi.\nI think you’ll notice a lot of friendly feelings!
There we go!\c\nI think that lomi lomi session helped inspire\nsome good, friendly feelings toward you.
There we go!\c\nI think this session was a good start. It’s feeling\na bit more friendly toward you already, I’d say.
I can only manage one session of lomi lomi per\nday, but do feel free to come again tomorrow!
Do you want to know if your Pokémon feel\nfriendly toward you or not?
I understand. Sometimes knowing can be\nworse than not knowing.
Then I’ll have a look at your [VAR PKNAME(0001)]\nthere, shall I?
My! It feels incredibly close to you!\nNothing makes it happier than being with you!
You clearly love your [VAR PKNAME(0000)], and you\nmust spend a lot of time together.
Hm. I’d say that you and [VAR PKNAME(0000)] have\nthe potential to be an even greater combo.
Hmmm. I think...it feels friendly toward you.\nAt least a little...
Hmmm... I’d say that you and your Pokémon\nstill have a long way to go.
What is going on here? Do you let it get knocked\nout a lot in battles or something? This is bad.
Oh dear. You must be a merciless Trainer...\nDo you use Frustration or just not know better?
Oh tapu! How could you leave it like this?!\nTake it to a Pokémon Center right now!
You’re curious about an Egg?\nYou must want to meet whatever is inside soon!

I would like to entrust you with a very precious\nPokémon, as both an apology and a show of\r\ngratitude on behalf of the foundation.
It looks like your Boxes are full, though.\nPlease make some space and come back again.
Porygon is a miracle born of science.\nA Pokémon with a digital brain.
Science exists to lead us to a brighter future.\c\nAnd I am here to protect those who will inherit\nthat future.
The Aether Foundation funds this facility.\c\nPeople and Pokémon can all live here, as equals\nand as family.
You’re [VAR TRNAME(0000)], aren’t you?\nI heard about you from Ms. Wicke.\c\nAs a member of the foundation, I’m grateful to\nyou...and I also feel I owe you some apology.\r\nHere. Please take this.
I believe that the foundation will change after...\nwell...all that ruckus that happened.\c\nWe will reflect on our errors and remake the\nfoundation as something even more than it was.\c\nWe will work hard to update and improve.
I can admit that I did wonder for a time about\nwhether I should quit the foundation.\c\nBut I want to keep protecting the smiles of the\nchildren and the Pokémon here.

It’s a vending machine!\nWhat kind of drink do you want?

That’s right.\nYou don’t need anything more to carry now.

Bwo! Bwo!\nBwooorrrrrr!
I wouldn’t tease that one.\nIf you do, he’ll buck and kick you.
Tauros are generally known as spirited Pokémon,\nbut this fellow is pretty feisty even for a Tauros.\c\nBut I guess it’s not that surprising, considering\nhow new he is to the ranch.
I’d like him to train to become a Ride Pokémon.\c\nBut I can’t even put him through his paces if\nhe bucks at every little thing like this.
I guess we’ll need the mistress’s skill for\nthis one!
The mistress?
Is that you?
The mistress of Paniola Ranch, of course!\nShe can get even the most unruly Tauros\r\nsnapped right into line!
Me? Ridiculous!\nHahahahah!\c\nYou think the mistress is some weak little girl?
Right then.\nIt’s time we call the mistress!
Here she is...the mistress of the ranch!\nMiltank!
Moooo moooo!
One roar from Miltank and even the most ornery\nTauros is instantly as quiet as a little Litten!
Mil moooooo!
Mooo!\nMo-mo mo moooooo!
Mroooowwwrrrr!
Mooooooooo!
Hff! Mooo!\nMooorrrrrrrrr!
Well, they do say the stronger the Tauros is,\nthe harder it is to control.\c\nLooks like even the mistress is having a tough\ntime with this one.
Maybe if he burns off a bit of excess energy,\nit’ll be a bit easier to bring him to heel...\c\nWhat do you think?\nHow about taking on Tauros in a battle?
Sure, I’ll battle
Maybe later...
Then don’t hold back!\nGo all out against this one!
Really? I thought it’d be a great help to us if\nyou could do it...
Looks like you worked up a fine sweat!\nI think Tauros feels pretty satisfied, too.
Bwoooooor!
Moooooo!\nMo-mo mooo!
Mo... Hff...
Even Tauros couldn’t stand up to the combined\npowers of the pair of you and Miltank!
Thanks, sweetie!\nJust what we expect of the ranch’s mistress!
Mil-mooooooooo!
Thanks to you, I think we can finally start on\nthis fellow’s Ride Pokémon training.\c\nI hope you’ll take this!
With Ride Pokémon, even people who aren’t\nPokémon Trainers can enjoy a convenient life.
Bwooorrr!
None of our Tauros dare slack off as long as the\nmistress is watching! Hah!
Mil-moooooo!

So...so...
Cooor!
This Pokémon seems to be hurt...\nWhat will you do?
Use a Potion on it
Take it to a Pokémon Center
Sorry, sorry, sorry!\nI know! I took way too long!\c\n...Huh?
I just left my Pokémon here to play for a little bit\nwhile I was shopping in town.\c\nI checked that there weren’t any Pokémon here\nthat would bully my Corsola but...\c\nBut there was a Mareanie hiding in the rocks!\nOooh! I want to fish it up and show it my wrath!
Mareanie love breaking off and eating Corsola’s\nbranches more than anything else in the world!\c\nThey hunt Corsola down mercilessly to gnaw\nand nibble on their branches!\c\nSure, the Corsola’s branches can regenerate\nand they’ll eventually grow back, but...\r\nThat doesn’t make it any less scary for Corsola!
You were worried about my Corsola and trying\nto help them, weren’t you?\c\nThank you. You’re a really nice Trainer.\c\nHere, take this from me.\nIt might come in handy.
Come on, let’s get you both all better.\nOff to the Pokémon Center!

Uhhh...what?
Just what I would expect of a Champion!\nThat is very wise thinking.\c\nI’m a top-ranking player in the golf world, and\nthat is because I still practice every day.[VAR 0114(0019)]
You’re the Champion, aren’t you?\c\nI’m a top-ranking player in the golf world, and\nthat is because I still practice every day![VAR 0114(0019)]

What?! You mean you ran out of Beast Balls?!\c\nWell...then I suppose I must give you one of the\nextras that I have been holding in reserve![VAR 0114(001F)]
You have succeeded in the capture of...[VAR NUM1(0001)] UB[VAR NUMBRNCH(0001,0100)]s!\c\nYou’ve nearly done it, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\nDo your best, young friend![VAR 0114(001F)]
You must not lie to the International Police!\nI will overlook it this once, but be warned![VAR 0114(001F)]
Amazing! Bravo! You have done it!\nI must call the chief back at once![VAR 0114(001F)]
Roger that, my young companion.\nThen be careful as you go on your way![VAR 0114(001F)]
Ah yes, the matter of the UBs.\c\nDisclosing info on this is prohibited, so let’s\nplease keep this between you and me.\c\nFirst, please take these.[VAR 0114(0016)]
The International Police asked me to pass them\nto you.[VAR 0114(0016)]
What are they?
Poké Balls?
Those are Beast Balls, which the Aether\nFoundation developed in great secrecy...\c\nThey are a special kind of Poké Ball that are\nspecialized for capturing Ultra Beasts.\c\nAs a result, they are very expensive to make, so\nwe have not been able to mass-produce them.\c\nPlease consider your timing very carefully for\nwhen you will use them during a battle.[VAR 0114(0016)]
The appearance of the UBs is something that\nwe at the foundation are to blame for...\c\nThat is why I will do whatever is within my\npower to assist you in this.\c\nFor now, perhaps you should return to Ms.\nAnabel at the motel in Akala.\c\nShe may have discovered new info.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Please just ask if there’s ever anything that\nI can help explain, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].[VAR 0114(0016)]
Tell me about the Beast Balls
What’s special about the UBs?
Show me the UB data
Nihilego
Buzzwole
Pheromosa
Xurkitree
Kartana
Celesteela
Guzzlord
Never mind
Ultra Beasts are life-forms from another world.\c\nIf you try to throw a regular Poké Ball at one,\nthe ball will have a difficult time recognizing the\r\ncreature as a Pokémon, and so the capturing\r\nfunction will be significantly impaired.\c\nBut these special balls should allow you to\ncapture beasts quite normally.\c\nThey could be considered the foundation’s\nnegative assets, but I hope they will help you.[VAR 0114(0016)]
The UBs surround themselves with an aura\ncalled the Beast Boost.\c\nThe truth of this aura is that it is the energy\nthat flows within the Ultra Wormhole.\c\nWhen the UBs pass through the Ultra Wormhole,\nthey are bathed in a great deal of this energy\r\nand likely store it within their bodies.[VAR 0114(0016)]
There are also Pokémon on our planet that\npossess this same kind of energy.\c\nI think you know what I mean.\c\nThe so-called Totem Pokémon that you faced in\nyour trials.\c\nThis is because the energy pours down upon\nour planet when the holes open.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Which Ultra Beast would you like to learn\nmore about?[VAR 0114(0016)]
UB-01. Code name: “Symbiont.”\nProperly known as Nihilego.\c\nThere have been sightings reported of this\nbeast in Alola’s past.\c\nIts most distinctive feature is its parasitic\ncapability.\c\nWhen Nihilego latches on to a host, it does not\nmanipulate its actions directly.\c\nRather it awakens the host’s own capabilities\nand boosts them to an extreme extent in order\r\nto protect itself.
It injects the host with a sort of neurotoxin to\nachieve this effect.\c\nThis neurotoxin of Nihilego’s is incredibly\nstimulating and inspires feelings of extreme\r\nexcitement and a lack of inhibition in its host.\c\nIn other words, anything or anyone that a\nNihilego latches on to will have its native skills\r\nforcibly activated to their fullest extent and will\r\nthen act as it naturally desires to.
UB-02. Code name: “Absorption.”\nProperly known as Buzzwole.\c\nThis UB was sighted for the first time following\nthe incidents at Aether Foundation.\c\nIts most distinctive feature is its skill to\nstrengthen itself.\c\nBuzzwole is able to absorb energy and then\nachieve a chemical reaction between the energy\r\nit has absorbed and its own body fluids.
As a result, Buzzwole’s body swells to an\nalmost explosive extent.\c\nIts muscles bulge and are so thick and dense\nthat they are stronger even than steel.\c\nBoth its Attack and Defense experience a clear\nleap in power.\c\nIt also displays a habit of striking a pose each\ntime that it takes any sort of action...\c\nIt is thought this might serve as a method of\ncommunication, but it is not well understood.
UB-02. Code name: “Beauty.”\nProperly known as Pheromosa.\c\nThis UB was sighted for the first time following\nthe incidents at Aether Foundation.\c\nThis UB can reach speeds exceeding 120 mph\nin just an instant.\c\nThis speed is greater than any other living\ncreature that has been discovered to date.\c\nBut its most distinctive features may in fact be\nits beauty and its powerful pheromones.
Most any creature that squares off against a\nPheromosa becomes confused, as if struck by\r\nthe beast’s beauty, and loses the will to fight.\c\nIt is still a subject of research, but it’s thought\nthat Pheromosa may possess some sort of\r\norgan able to produce a pheromonal substance\r\npreviously unknown to science.
UB-03. Code name: “Lighting.”\nProperly known as Xurkitree.\c\nThis UB was sighted for the first time following\nthe incidents at Aether Foundation.\c\nIts most distinctive feature is an organ that\ncan generate power.\c\nThis UB’s bodily makeup is highly reminiscent\nof electric wiring, thus enabling it to conduct\r\nelectricity with great efficiency.
It can discharge as much as a million volts of\npower at a time.\c\nWhen it begins to run out of power, it stabs its\nlegs and tail into the soil, entering a treelike\r\nstate as it absorbs electricity from the ground.
UB-04. Code name: “Blade.”\nProperly known as Kartana.\c\nThis UB was sighted for the first time following\nthe incidents at Aether Foundation.\c\nIts most distinctive feature is its thin and razor-\nsharp body, of which every edge has as cruel\r\na cutting edge as any well-honed blade.\c\nThe edges on its arms are particularly in a class\nof their own.
Any opponent who tries to attack it will be\ncut down with a single strike of its “blades.”\c\nIts thin body also allows it to evade attacks by\ndancing lightly out of the way.\c\nThis is a very dangerous creature, considering\nits excellent offensive and defensive\r\ncapabilities, but due to the nature of its body, it\r\nis also highly vulnerable to fire and moisture.
UB-04. Code name: “Blaster.”\nProperly known as Celesteela.\c\nThis UB was sighted for the first time following\nthe incidents at Aether Foundation.\c\nIts most distinctive feature is the energy that\nit stores within itself, a flammable gas that it\r\ncan shoot from its two huge arms.
This is mostly used to propel itself in flight and\nfor battle, but it is thought to have sufficient\r\npower and lift to even fly into space.\c\nIts bodily construction closely resembles that of\na plant, and it absorbs nutrients from the soil.
UB-05. Code name: “Glutton.”\nProperly known as Guzzlord.\c\nThis UB has been sighted in the Alola region\nin the past as well, according to our reports.\c\nIt seems it was targeted by the International\nPolice in a top-secret mission at that time.\c\nIts most distinctive feature is its limitless\nappetite. It feeds without pause every moment\r\nthat it is awake.
It uses the two large tongues that protrude from\nits mouth to catch and devour everything in its\r\npath, be it organic or inorganic matter.\c\nAnd while it eats such an inordinate amount,\nGuzzlord excreta has never been discovered.\c\nIt is thought that it might fully convert the\nthings that it eats into energy for it to use.
Please...do be careful.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Hm? What is this Pokédex data,\n[VAR TRNAME(0000)]?\c\n...Necrozma.\c\nIt’s black, yet it’s refracting light...\c\nBut we haven’t had any word from HQ about\nsuch a UB.\c\nIt must be simply a rare Pokémon.\nStill, it’s quite remarkable, though![VAR 0114(001F)]

Hey. You.[VAR 0114(0030)]
You are the one they call [VAR TRNAME(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0030)]
I am
Not me
Hm...[VAR 0114(0030)]
I can see right through any lies you tell, [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0403)]boygirl.[VAR 0114(0030)]
A certain...interested party sent me here\nto you...to give you this.[VAR 0114(0030)]
You should have a look at what it says.[VAR 0114(0030)]
But take care where you read it.\nNo one else is to know of my visit or that card.[VAR 0114(0030)]
So you actually came...[VAR 0114(0030)]
You must be [VAR TRNAME(0000)]. Mustn’t you?[VAR 0114(0030)]
Please, you’ll have to forgive me for my stunning\ndisguise earlier.[VAR 0114(0030)]
I’m very grateful that you accepted my invitation\nto join me here in my room.\c\nMy name...it is Looker.\nI am a member of the International Police.[VAR 0114(0030)]
And this figure here is my boss...[VAR 0114(001F)]
It is an honor to meet you, of course,\nthe first Champion of Alola.\c\nPlease forgive our rude summons.\c\nMy name is Anabel.\c\nI am the head of a secret division within the\nInternational Police. We are the UB Task Force.[VAR 0114(0030)]
Please forgive me for the most sudden question,\nbut I must ask...\c\nis it true that you encountered UB Symbiont?[VAR 0114(001F)]
UB?
Symbiont?
The UBs are the beasts...\notherwise known as Ultra Beasts.\c\nThey are unidentified life-forms that reside in\na different world from the one we live in.\c\nThat Nihilego creature you encountered was\none such beast.[VAR 0114(0029)]
Yes, UB-01...Symbiont.\nI suppose you knew it as Nihilego.\c\nThe International Police refers to all of the\nUBs by code names, like Symbiont there.\c\nI believe you might recognize it as the Pokémon\nthat the woman Lusamine fused with?[VAR 0114(0029)]
Now that we have cleared that up, please allow\nme to ask once more.\c\nDid you come in contact with Symbiont?\nThat is, with Nihilego?[VAR 0114(001F)]
I did
I beat it
Just as we had thought...[VAR 0114(0029)]
That seems to settle things, Chief.[VAR 0114(001F)]
Listen. Everything that we are about to share\nwith you is highly classified information.\c\nWe must ask that you keep all that you learn\nhere to yourself.\c\nThe incident that Ms. Lusamine caused...\nSymbiont wasn’t the only UB to appear from\r\nthe Ultra Wormhole that was temporarily\r\nopened at that time.[VAR 0114(0029)]
We have confirmed the presence of another\nSymbiont, other than the one you encountered.\r\nAnd we have received reports of sightings of\r\nseveral other types of UBs...\c\nThe UBs are dangerous beings whose powers\nexceed the boundaries and logic of our world.\c\nAnd they were dropped rudely into this world\nagainst their own will...\c\nWe can only expect that they will be extremely\nwary and combative.[VAR 0114(001F)]
And so we have been tasked with three duties.\c\nThe first is to investigate the ecology of these\nunidentified UBs.\c\nThe second is to look out for UBs and protect\nthe people from any harm.\c\nAnd the third is to either protect the UBs...\nor destroy them...[VAR 0114(0029)]
If the UBs are destructive beings that will seek\nsome sort of revenge upon our world, then the\r\norder from above is to erase them completely.[VAR 0114(001F)]
But neither myself nor Looker would like to see\nthat happen.\c\nEven if they are UBs, they are living creatures.\nWe would like to protect them and save them.[VAR 0114(0029)]
But protecting the UBs...\c\nit would seem to amount to catching them,\nand that is a more difficult task than simply\r\ndestroying them would be.\c\nWe do not currently have the battle power\nnecessary to achieve such a goal.[VAR 0114(001F)]
And so we finally arrive at the point.\nLet us dispense with any pretense...\c\nWe wish for you, the Champion of Alola, to\nlend us your assistance.[VAR 0114(0029)]
[VAR TRNAME(0000)]...\nwe want you to join our team.\c\nPlease give your aid to the UB Task Force.[VAR 0114(0029)]
Sure!
What?!
Please...\nWe want to save the UBs.\c\nBut to do that, we will need your strength...[VAR 0114(0029)]
You accept?\nThank you very much![VAR 0114(0029)]
So that means, Chief...[VAR 0114(001F)]
I know, Mr. Looker.[VAR 0114(0029)]
It is only a formality, but I still must test you\nto ensure that you can handle this job.\c\n[VAR TRNAME(0000)].\nMay I ask you to join me in a battle?\c\nI will wait until you are ready, so do whatever\npreparations you need and then speak with me.[VAR 0114(0029)]
You will want to prepare quite well for this.\nMy boss is a very tough lady.[VAR 0114(001F)]
So you’re ready for me?\nLet’s begin then, shall we?\c\nLet me see your talent in its entirety.\nNo need to hold back.[VAR 0114(0029)]
Thank you...\nI believe the testing is complete.[VAR 0114(0029)]
I see no problem at all with your skills.\nRather I would have to praise you for them.[VAR 0114(0029)]
I hope that we will do fine work together.[VAR 0114(0029)]
So now you are a member of our team, young\n[VAR TRNAME(0000)]! You are most welcome!\c\nThen there is no time to be wasting.\nLet us begin your first job!\c\nThe chief and I will set out to gather more\ninformation about the UBs.\c\nWe want to ask you to visit the secret labs in\nthe bottom of Aether Paradise![VAR 0114(001F)]
There you should find our other partner in this\nendeavor. The vice-chief of the Alolan branch\r\nof the Aether Foundation: Ms. Wicke.[VAR 0114(0029)]
She will know why you’ve come.\c\nNow set forth, young [VAR TRNAME(0000)]![VAR 0114(001F)]
The lower floors of Aether Paradise.\c\nThat is where you must go to find the secret\nlabs and to meet with Ms. Wicke.[VAR 0114(0029)]
Welcome back.[VAR 0114(0029)]
It would seem that you managed to meet with\nMs. Wicke.\c\nI also expect Mr. Looker will return shortly...[VAR 0114(0029)]
È un disastro![VAR 0114(001F)]
Is...something the matter, Mr. Looker?\nIf you spoke in English, I might understand.\c\nWhat has you so bothered?[VAR 0114(0029)]
I’m sorry! It is a terrible habit I picked up.\nBut we do have a disaster in the making!\c\nSightings are being reported of another UB-01!\nIt is Symbiont!\c\nAnd the perp has been right here in Akala,\nright under our very noses![VAR 0114(001F)]
I understand.[VAR 0114(0029)]
Then, Mr. Looker. M[VAR GENDBR(00FF,0302)]r.iss [VAR TRNAME(0000)].\nIt looks like we have a job to do.[VAR 0114(0029)]
My task will be to protect the populated areas.[VAR 0114(0029)]
[VAR TRNAME(0000)]...\nyou will go to where the sighting was reported.[VAR 0114(0029)]
Mr. Looker, you are to stay here and coordinate\nour backup, if we should need it.[VAR 0114(0029)]
I...I see...[VAR 0114(001F)]
Backup is a vital part of any operation,\nMr. Looker.\c\nWe are entrusting our safety to you.[VAR 0114(0029)]
Yes, ma’am![VAR 0114(001F)]
Then I will be going ahead.\c\n[VAR TRNAME(0000)], stay safe![VAR 0114(0029)]
Good luck out there, Chief![VAR 0114(001F)]
Young [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\nDo take care and keep yourself safe out there!\c\nIf you ever are in need of more information,\nyou may come talk with me![VAR 0114(001F)]
I’ve finished sending the data from the UB you\nprotected to HQ. And to Ms. Wicke as well.\c\nThank you for your hard work, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].\c\nWith this development, I think we will be able\nto solve the mysteries surrounding Nihilego.[VAR 0114(0029)]
Well! Regardless of all that, congratulations are\nin order, young [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\c\nI, the great Looker, think I shall provide a great\nfeast to celebrate your great success and\r\nyour addition to our team!\c\nThere are some rather tasty restaurants here\non this island, after all![VAR 0114(001F)]
Oh? But how would you know that, Mr. Looker?\c\nWe have only just arrived in Alola...[VAR 0114(0029)]
Urm! I read about them in a magazine they had\nat the local Pokémon Center!\c\nD-don’t you worry yourself about the details!\nI’ll go and ask if they don’t do delivery.[VAR 0114(001F)]
My goodness...\nThat Mr. Looker...[VAR 0114(0029)]
Oh yes.\nThere was one other thing I wanted to tell you.\c\nThe original plan was that the UB you caught\nwould be collected by the International Police.\c\nHowever, we have been able to secure official\npermission for you to keep it, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].[VAR 0114(0029)]
It was a bit of a hassle to get all the details\nironed out, but...\c\nIf we take the UB to headquarters, it would\nend up as a research subject.[VAR 0114(0029)]
I expect it will be much happier staying with\nyou, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].[VAR 0114(0029)]
C’est une catastrophe![VAR 0114(001F)]
M-Mr. Looker...\nYes? What is it this time?\r\nIn English, if you please.[VAR 0114(0029)]
I’m sorry! It is just a habit of mine!\nBut never mind that—we have a disaster!\c\nI got a tip about a new UB sighting!\c\nThis time the sighting was on Melemele Island.\nI’m sorry, but we’ll have to put off our feast![VAR 0114(001F)]
I understand.\c\nLet us hurry to Melemele Island at once.[VAR 0114(0029)]
Yes, ma’am![VAR 0114(001F)]
I will go ahead to Melemele Island and set up a\nnew base of operations at the motel there.\c\nPlease join us there as soon as you’re ready,\n[VAR TRNAME(0000)].[VAR 0114(0029)]
We make for Melemele at once!\nWe’re trusting in you, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\c\nDon’t forget: the Melemele motel is on Route 2![VAR 0114(001F)]

Oh? Looks like you’re a trial-goer, eh?\nI’ve got a favor to ask of you then.
I’d be happy to help
I’m too busy
...Oh. So that’s how it is, eh?\c\nNo time to listen to an old lady’s problems,\nis that right?
Route 10 here is long and wide, and it’s a great\nplace to let your Pokémon play a bit.\c\nMy Stufful hadn’t been getting much exercise\nlately, so I let them out of their balls to have\r\nthem run around a bit...\c\nBut they haven’t come back!\c\nI want to go look for them, but it’s hard for\nan old lady like me to traipse all around...
If you find one of my little Stufful, you just tell\nthem to come back to me.\c\nThey’re impish creatures, but smart as a cookie\nand with noses that could sniff out anything.\r\nThey’ll find their way back home to me.
Will you help me find my Stufful along\nRoute 10?
Sure
I’m too busy
I’ve got [VAR NUM1(0000)] Stufful lost out there somewhere.\nMaybe they’re hiding?
...Oh, I see.\nSympathy is a real rare commodity these days.
*sniff sniff*
Grrrr!
The Stufful ran off in a hurry...
Hmm...\c\nWell, [VAR NUM1(0001)] of them have come back so far...\c\nBut where [VAR NUMBRNCH(0002,0D0B)]is the lastare the other [VAR NUM1(0002)] still hiding?
Oh! You, child!\c\nAll of my Stufful have made it back, thanks\nto you!
You’ve been a great help to me here.\nI surely do owe you, my young friend.\c\nTake these from me, along with my thanks.
Cute and strong and just a little bit wild...\c\nThat’s what a Pokémon should be like!\nAnd that’s why Stufful is the best.
Glistening sweat! Slippery goo!\nThe perfect tune that keeps Hano Beach going!\r\nPyukumuku chuckers are desperately needed!\r\nWon’t you become a Pyukumuku chucker?
What’s that?
I’m too busy
Now that’s a shame!\nThe job pays pretty good, you know!
I’m one of the staff members responsible for\nkeeping Hano Beach spotless for our guests.\c\nBut Pyukumuku sometimes wriggle up on our\nbeach from the sea.\c\nI don’t know why they do it, but we can’t just\nleave them there.\c\nThey shrivel up on land and that’s not all...\nOur guests get grossed out seeing them and\r\nsometimes even get hurt stepping on them!
So we end up with no choice but to chuck\nthose poor Pyukumuku back into the sea!\c\nI’ll explain the job to you. It’s pretty easy.\c\nStep one! Catch Pyukumuku!\c\nStep two! Throw the Pyukumuku back into\nthe sea!\c\nStep three! Report back to me once every last\nPyukumuku on the beach is returned to the sea!
So what do you say? Think you’ve got what it\ntakes to be a Pyukumuku chucker?
Sure, I do
I’m too busy
Then get every last Pyukumuku on this beach\ndiving right back into the sea!\c\nLet’s see... I can still see [VAR NUM1(0000)] Pyukumuku left on\nthe sand and in need of saving!
We really need some more hands to get this job\ntaken care of. Come back if you ever have time!
Puke?
Muke...
You chucked the Pyukumuku back into\nthe sea...
Hey there, part-timer!\c\nYou’ve gotten [VAR NUM1(0001)] Pyukumuku safely back into\nthe sea so far.\c\nWhich means that you’ve still got [VAR NUM1(0002)] more to\nreturn to the sea!
Good job, part-timer!\c\nYou’ve got every last Pyukumuku that was\nstranded on the beach back into the sea!\c\nNow they are safe back where they should be,\nand the beach is safe for our guests.
You’re a real good worker, you know?\nYou have a real knack for Pyukumuku chucking.\c\nAnd I’ve got your pay ready for you right here.\nTake it! You’ve earned it!
Pyukumuku are one of the most famous of all\nthe Alolan Pokémon.\c\nBut a lot of tourists from other regions don’t\nunderstand their appeal. It’s a real shame.
But no matter how many times we toss them\nback into the sea, they come wriggling back up\r\nthe next morning like clockwork.\c\nFeel free to come back and help again whenever\nyou have some spare time!
It looks like all of the Stufful have gone back\nto their Trainer...
It looks like all the Pyukumuku are gone from\nthe beach...

Thank you for joining us, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].[VAR 0114(0029)]
Mr. Looker has already set out to gather more\ninformation about the UB.\c\nI have been waiting here on standby.\nI expect we will have another visitor soon.[VAR 0114(0029)]
A visitor?
Who?
A mysterious person who claims to have some\nknowledge of the UB.\c\nHe insisted that he would not share any more\ndetails with me until we met in person...\c\nBut if he does have any real insight into the UB,\nthen we cannot let this opportunity pass us by.[VAR 0114(0029)]
So I think it is best if you and I wait to take any\nfurther action now. And that we trust Mr. Looker\r\nto handle the fieldwork.\c\nThough I do feel bad asking him to do all the\nwork for us.[VAR 0114(0029)]
I must applaud Mr. Looker for that remarkable\nenergy of his.\c\nHe is in a class of his own, even within the\nelite members of the International Police...\c\nI would never have expected someone like him\nto serve under my command...[VAR 0114(0029)]

Mr. Nanu was in fact a superior of mine when\nI first joined the International Police...\c\nI never dreamed that I would meet him once\nagain under circumstances such as these...[VAR 0114(0029)]
But if the information that he shared with us is\ncorrect, then there are multiple UBs this time.[VAR 0114(0029)]
The situation is dangerous.\nIf we don’t act at once...[VAR 0114(0029)]
¡Es un desastre![VAR 0114(001F)]
M-Mr. Looker...\nIn English, if you would...[VAR 0114(0029)]
I’m sorry! But please!\nThis is no time to care about my odd habits!\c\nThe UB sightings! I’ve gotten a hot tip!\c\nThe perp really is right here on Melemele![VAR 0114(001F)]
It appears that it might be UB Absorption!\c\nIt seems to be a UB of great strength and\nformidable muscles!\c\nBut that is not all...\nIt is not one creature, but two!\r\nIn Melemele Meadow![VAR 0114(001F)]
It appears that it might be UB Beauty!\c\nIt seems to be a beautiful yet dangerous UB\nthat can move at incredible speeds!\c\nBut that is not all...\nIt is not one specimen, but four!\r\nIn Verdant Cavern![VAR 0114(001F)]
So it appears that his information was correct...[VAR 0114(0029)]
Hm? What’s that?\nDid you say something just now, Chief?[VAR 0114(001F)]
No... It’s nothing.\c\nI understand, Mr. Looker.[VAR 0114(0029)]
Then, Mr. Looker. M[VAR GENDBR(00FF,0302)]r.iss [VAR TRNAME(0000)].\nIt looks like we have a job to do.[VAR 0114(0029)]
My task will be to protect the populated areas.[VAR 0114(0029)]
[VAR TRNAME(0000)].\nYou will go to where the sighting was reported.[VAR 0114(0029)]
Mr. Looker, you are to stay here and act as our\nbackup once again, in case we should need it.[VAR 0114(0029)]
Hold it right there!\nNot again! This time I insist that I...[VAR 0114(001F)]
Please understand, Mr. Looker.\c\nYou do not have a partner Pokémon with you.\c\nI cannot allow you to operate in a place where\nyou are likely to encounter danger![VAR 0114(0029)]
And besides that...having such an experienced\nveteran as yourself serve as our backup is a\r\nvital task in an operation like this one.[VAR 0114(0029)]
Understood, ma’am![VAR 0114(001F)]
Then I must be off.\n[VAR TRNAME(0000)], I wish you fortune in battle![VAR 0114(0029)]
Good luck out there, Chief![VAR 0114(001F)]
You take these, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].\nI received them from Madam Wicke.[VAR 0114(001F)]
I trust that you will be careful out there, my\nyoung [VAR TRNAME(0000)].\c\nAnd one last thing before you go...\c\nMadam Wicke finished analyzing all of the data\nthat we gathered on Nihilego, AKA UB Symbiont.\c\nIf you wish to learn more about that creature,\nyou should speak with Madam Wicke in the\r\nAether Paradise secret labs!\c\nNow it is time we get to work.\nAnd I’m here if you need to ask me anything![VAR 0114(001F)]
I’ve finished sending the data from the UB you\nprotected to HQ. And to Ms. Wicke as well.\c\nThank you for your hard work, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].[VAR 0114(0029)]
With this data, I think we will be able to solve\nthe mysteries regarding UB Absorption...\r\notherwise known as Buzzwole.[VAR 0114(0029)]
With this data, I think we will be able to solve\nthe mysteries regarding UB Beauty...\r\notherwise known as Pheromosa.[VAR 0114(0029)]
Ugh...[VAR 0114(0029)]
What’s the matter, Chief?![VAR 0114(001F)]
I’m fine... I’m fine.\c\nThere were just so many of them this time that\nI was nearly run off my feet...[VAR 0114(0029)]
... ...[VAR 0114(001F)]
What? I’m fine, really!\nPlease don’t stare at me like that![VAR 0114(0029)]
Y-yes. Of course, ma’am.[VAR 0114(001F)]
You two must also be tired.\nWhat shall we do now?[VAR 0114(0029)]
If you are terribly exhausted, there is only one\nnatural conclusion to make...[VAR 0114(001F)]
The one thing that takes away all weariness!\nIt is, of course, a feast!\c\nThis time, indeed, we must have a great feast\nto celebrate our successful mission!\c\nAnd there is a restaurant here on this island\nwhere we can eat to our stomach’s content!\r\nI speak of course of the Battle Buffet![VAR 0114(001F)]
Oh? How curious. How is it that you are once\nagain so familiar with the local restaurants?[VAR 0114(0029)]
... ...\c\nI-it’s just by chance! The chanciest of chances!\nNot the Chansey-est, mind you. Just chance!\c\nN-never you mind that! The most important fact\nright now is that it is a very popular place!\r\nI will go at once to make a reservation![VAR 0114(001F)]
Mr. Looker is simply hopeless, isn’t he?[VAR 0114(0029)]
And Mr. Nanu...\c\nhe was an excellent police officer years ago.\c\nHe was on par with Mr. Looker even...back then.\c\nI’m really only here in this position now because\nof him...[VAR 0114(0029)]
Es ist ein Desaster![VAR 0114(001F)]
Oh? Mr. Looker?\nBack so soon again?[VAR 0114(0029)]
Could it be...[VAR 0114(0029)]
Yes, it could indeed! In fact it is, Chief!\c\nI’ve gotten a tip about another UB sighting!\c\nThis time it is on Akala Island!\nWe must delay our feast once again![VAR 0114(001F)]
Roger that, Mr. Looker.\c\nThen we must hurry to Akala Island at once.[VAR 0114(0029)]
Yes, ma’am![VAR 0114(001F)]
We will return to the motel that we formerly\nused as our base of operations on Akala.\c\nI hope you will join us there as soon as you are\nready, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].[VAR 0114(0029)]
Back to Akala!\nWe are still counting on you, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].\c\nThe motel on Akala’s Route 8!\nThat is the place you must come![VAR 0114(001F)]

Oh! Here you are at last, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]![VAR 0114(001F)]
I’ve already been able to gather all of the intel\nwe need about the UBs this time.\c\nSo the chief has already left to help secure the\nsite and protect the surrounding areas.[VAR 0114(001F)]
Hallo![VAR 0114(0012)]
This precocious young lady here was my\ninformant this time![VAR 0114(001F)]
They sent me here on an errand.\nSince I’m not busy doing trials or anything.[VAR 0114(0012)]
Hmm?\nWho is that?[VAR 0114(001F)]
It’s a secret.\c\nOh, and I had one more order I was given.\nOr was it a request? Either way...[VAR 0114(0012)]
What might that be?[VAR 0114(001F)]
I was told I should have a real serious battle\nwith [VAR TRNAME(0000)] before I came back.\c\nI don’t really know why, but it seems like maybe\nit’s some sort of trial of strength.[VAR 0114(0012)]
So come on! Let’s have a battle!\nHave a Pokémon battle against me![VAR 0114(0012)]
Sure
Hold on
Shocking! You want me to wait?\nFine then. I guess I can wait.[VAR 0114(0012)]
Is that precocious young miss powerful?[VAR 0114(001F)]
All right!\nThen let’s get going already!\c\nTime for Mina to show you her full power!\nWe’ll get our Z on![VAR 0114(0012)]
Whoa, you’re surprisingly strong!\c\nThen it’s no problem.\nTurns out, you’re strong enough,\r\n[VAR TRNAME(0000)].[VAR 0114(0012)]
It seems that my precocious young miss here is\nnot to be trifled with either...[VAR 0114(001F)]
OK, I’m out of here![VAR 0114(0012)]
She is rather odd, isn’t she?\nA real individual spirit...[VAR 0114(001F)]
But now we should get our heads on straight\nand get to work!\c\nI do not like it, but I am in charge of backup\nonce again![VAR 0114(001F)]
And for you, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].\nThe Beast Balls you will need for this mission![VAR 0114(001F)]
First, the regular reports, let us get them out of\nthe way, my young friend...\c\nMadam Wicke finished analyzing all of the data\nthat we gathered on the last UB you caught.\c\nIf you wish to learn more about that creature,\nyou should speak with Madam Wicke in the\r\nAether Paradise secret labs!\c\nAnd now it is time we get to work.\nIf you need to ask me anything, I am here![VAR 0114(001F)]
I’ve finished sending the data from the UB you\nprotected to HQ. And to Ms. Wicke as well.\c\nThank you for your hard work, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].\c\nWe should unravel the mysteries of Xurkitree,\nalso known as UB Lighting.[VAR 0114(0029)]
Ngh...[VAR 0114(0029)]
Are you all right, ma’am?![VAR 0114(001F)]
Y...yes...\nI’m fine, Mr. Looker.\c\nI just felt a passing vertigo...but I’m fine.\nPlease do not worry yourself.[VAR 0114(0029)]
But I must! I insist on worrying!\c\nYou have always had the stamina of a\nMachamp, Chief! I cannot believe this is nothing![VAR 0114(001F)]
No, please... It is nothing so serious...\c\nI’m sorry for causing you to worry about me.\nI insist that I really am fine...[VAR 0114(0029)]
Putting all that aside, I must say that we have\nfound a great ally in [VAR TRNAME(0000)].\r\nWhat a fantastic Trainer...\c\nIt was all that I could do to simply keep that\nXurkitree away from the town...[VAR 0114(0029)]
The UBs seem to get terribly aggressive when\nthey spot me...\c\nIt’s like they are treating me as prey or an\nenemy...[VAR 0114(0029)]
I...I am sure it is only your imagination, Chief!\nYou must be exhausted![VAR 0114(001F)]
[~ 31]

That monster you’re calling Blaster...\nIt’s on Ula’ula Island.\c\nI’ll tell you more when you get there.[VAR 0114(000A)]
And your information...\nIt is all true?[VAR 0114(001F)]
I’m the kahuna of Ula’ula Island.\c\nIf you don’t do something about that monster\nfor me, our guardian’s not gonna be happy.[VAR 0114(000A)]

Mr. Looker... Do I take it that you are acquainted\nwith Mr. Nanu?[VAR 0114(0029)]
I knew him once. I thought.[VAR 0114(001F)]
Never mind that...\nRight now we need to focus on our mission.[VAR 0114(001F)]
Of course... Yes, of course you’re right.\c\nIf we have reports of a new UB sighting, then\nour mission is our first priority...[VAR 0114(0029)]

I’ve finished sending the data from the UB you\nprotected to HQ. And to Ms. Wicke as well.\c\nThank you for your hard work, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].[VAR 0114(0029)]
We should learn everything there is to know\nabout Kartana, also known as UB Blade.[VAR 0114(0029)]
We should learn everything there is to know\nabout Celesteela, also known as UB Blaster.[VAR 0114(0029)]
And...we have also had word from HQ.\c\nThere is only one UB left for us to take care of.[VAR 0114(0029)]
And we had our hands full with so many\nindividuals for this last UB...\c\nIt was a rather dangerous situation.\nBut you were all right, Chief?[VAR 0114(001F)]
Yes, of course!\nBoth me and my Pokémon were fine!\c\nOf course we ran into some difficult situations...\nBeing surrounded by the UBs and outflanked by\r\nthem made it rather touch and go for a while...[VAR 0114(0029)]
As I’d feared...[VAR 0114(001F)]
What is it, Mr. Looker?\c\nYou have been acting rather odd for a while\nnow, haven’t you?[VAR 0114(0029)]
Ah... No... It’s nothing.[VAR 0114(001F)]
Could it be...\c\nCould it be about our long-delayed feast?[VAR 0114(0029)]
Oh...\c\nYes! Yes, indeed! What a disaster that you\nhave found me out!\c\nThe truth is that I am starving, just starving!\nHow a Snorlax feels, I know exactly now![VAR 0114(001F)]
Hee... How hopeless you are, Mr. Looker.\c\nBut I suppose we have been putting it off for\nrather a long time. You must be hungry indeed.\c\nThen allow me to take point this time and find\na delicious restaurant for us all. ♪[VAR 0114(0029)]
Ah... Yes, ma’am! Thank you, ma’am![VAR 0114(001F)]
It’s a bit embarrassing to admit, but I’m actually\nquite famished myself!\c\nSo you two stay here and relax while I go and\nfind us a place to eat![VAR 0114(0029)]
The chief can’t take much more of this...\nShe must be exhausted.\c\nShe acts particularly cheery when she is feeling\nunwell to hide her weakness from others.[VAR 0114(001F)]
I know it may be a bit late for this...\nBut there is something I would like to tell you.[VAR 0114(001F)]
It is something that happened about 10 years\nago now...\c\nI came to the Alola region at that time as part of\na three-person team to eradicate a UB...[VAR 0114(001F)]
Of course we did not know them as UBs back\nthen. It was simply a dangerous creature.\c\nMy team succeeded in chasing down the UB.\nAnd then we tried to put an end to it...[VAR 0114(001F)]
But somebody screwed up.[VAR 0114(0030)]
Nanu...[VAR 0114(001F)]
This halfhearted fool here felt sorry for the\nmonster, even if only for a moment.\c\nThat moment was enough to get the third\nmember of our team done in by the UB.[VAR 0114(000A)]
This I cannot deny...\nI made an error of judgment.\c\nI failed to consider the fact that she was not\ntrained for combat...[VAR 0114(001F)]
She was just bait for the UB...[VAR 0114(000A)]
And the International Police knew it...\c\nThe UBs relentlessly seek out those who have\npassed through an Ultra Wormhole.\c\nThe passage must change them somehow...as\nthough they’ve been bathed in some energy...\r\nSomething that the beasts can smell or sense...\c\nIt is thought that the UBs can track such\npeople as though sniffing them out.[VAR 0114(001F)]
It’s not like the monsters come here by choice.\nThey don’t want to be here.\c\nSo they smell that familiar scent and think\nthere’ll be a wormhole. That they’ll get home.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Nanu, you called her bait...\nShe really was, wasn’t she?[VAR 0114(001F)]
Faller...[VAR 0114(000A)]
That is what the International Police calls them.\nHumans who appear from an Ultra Wormhole...\c\nand those who are bathed in a great deal of\nthe energy that pours out from them.\c\nShe had come through a wormhole.\nShe was from another world.\c\nAnd she was put on our team to help draw\nthe UB to us...[VAR 0114(001F)]
And now you’re repeating history.\c\nYou’ve got a Faller right here, haven’t you?\nThat’s right, boy. I’m talking about you.[VAR 0114(000A)]
And now you’re repeating history.\c\nYou’ve got a Faller right here, haven’t you?\nThat’s right, girl. I’m talking about you.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Yes...\nIt’s true. [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0201)]HShe passed through an Ultra Wormhole.\c\n[VAR TRNAME(0000)] was exposed to the energy,\nso [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0100)]she may indeed be a Faller.\c\nBut...[VAR 0114(001F)]
I’m back...[VAR 0114(0029)]
I’m sorry, young [VAR TRNAME(0000)].\nBut let us continue this talk another time.[VAR 0114(001F)]
I’m sorry, you two...\nI couldn’t get a reservation at the restaurant...\c\nIt seems like it’s a very popular place...[VAR 0114(0029)]
Hey, missy.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Mr. Nanu...\nI didn’t realize you were here.[VAR 0114(0029)]
Another one of those monsters appeared.\nThis time on Poni Island.\c\nI’ll tell you more when you get there. We’ll meet\nat the floating restaurant in Seafolk Village.[VAR 0114(000A)]
This next one seems like a real tough opponent.\nBe sure you’re ready for it.[VAR 0114(000A)]
O-oh... Yes, of course we will.\nThank you again, Mr. Nanu.[VAR 0114(0029)]
... ... ...[VAR 0114(001F)]
Um...Mr. Looker?\nIs everything all right?[VAR 0114(0029)]
Of course... It is fine...\nNot a problem at all...[VAR 0114(001F)]
Then I will make my way to the floating\nrestaurant at Poni Island.\c\nOnce you are ready, [VAR TRNAME(0000)], please do\ncome and join us there.[VAR 0114(0029)]
So it is on to Poni next...\nI will be counting on you, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].\c\nLet us meet again at the floating restaurant in\nSeafolk Village...[VAR 0114(001F)]

So you came...young [VAR TRNAME(0000)].[VAR 0114(001F)]
The chief has already left to set up protection\naround the populated areas...[VAR 0114(001F)]
You sent her off to the wrong location?[VAR 0114(000A)]
What choice did I have?\nShe is reaching her limit.\c\nWe have to force her to stand by to regain\nher strength...[VAR 0114(001F)]
So now we can finish our little talk.\nYou’ve got one Faller right here...[VAR 0114(000A)]
and the other one is Anabel.\nThough I don’t think she knows it herself.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Nanu and I, we found her here ten years ago, \nunconscious on the shore of this very island.\c\nWe’d just finished our mission here.[VAR 0114(001F)]
... ...[VAR 0114(000A)]
She had lost most of her memories, but four\nthings she could tell us.\c\nThat her name was Anabel...\nThat she came from the Hoenn region...\r\nThat she had protected some tower there...\r\nAnd that she was a powerful Trainer...[VAR 0114(001F)]
Then she was placed under observation by\nthe International Police.\c\nAll because they detected an insane amount of\nUltra Wormhole energy from her.[VAR 0114(000A)]
It may be that she was wandering lost in the\nwormhole for some time...\c\nRegardless of that, she then entered the\nInternational Police herself.[VAR 0114(001F)]
And then got promoted right up past you, her\nsenior, is that it?[VAR 0114(000A)]
Gotta hand it to the International Police.\nThey really are terrible.\c\nUsing the same strategy and setting up another\nFaller, even though the same thing failed before.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Your assumptions, you are half right in.\c\nHowever...this mission, she chose herself.[VAR 0114(001F)]
... ...[VAR 0114(000A)]
Perhaps something in her laments, whether she\nis conscious of it or not...\c\nPerhaps she feels some grief over the fate of\nthe UB, which came to this world just as\r\nshe did.[VAR 0114(001F)]
But she is still a Faller.\nIt is her fate to be targeted by the UBs.\c\nWith a Faller right before them, the UBs will run\nwild with excitement.\c\nNo matter how good she might be, everyone\nhas their limits.\c\nThat is why I had hoped to distract the UBs—\nto divert some of their attention.[VAR 0114(001F)]
That is why I asked you to help with the\ncatching of the UBs...[VAR 0114(001F)]
But you’re out of luck now.\c\nWith Anabel in that condition...\nShe’ll be done for if she runs into any UBs now.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Hm...\c\nYes, and I imagine that the false lead I sent her\nout on will not buy us much more time...[VAR 0114(001F)]
But before we’re out of time, boy...[VAR 0114(000A)]
But before we’re out of time, girl...[VAR 0114(000A)]
How about a battle with me?[VAR 0114(000A)]
No problem
Why?
Why not?\c\nIf you’ve got some preparation you need to do,\nthen I’ll wait here for you.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Maybe you already know this, but that guy is a\nreal tough opponent when he’s being serious.[VAR 0114(001F)]
What a good little boy you are...[VAR 0114(000A)]
What a good little girl you are...[VAR 0114(000A)]
Then let’s go.[VAR 0114(000A)]
That’ll do, [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0403)]boygirl.\nI think that’ll do fine.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Don’t let me down.[VAR 0114(000A)]
I won’t...000.[VAR 0114(001F)]
Well then, young [VAR TRNAME(0000)]...\nIt is our time to get down to work, is it not?\c\nOur final UB. Code name: Glutton...\c\nNanu said he would lead it deep into the heart\nof Resolution Cave...[VAR 0114(001F)]
Here you are. As usual.[VAR 0114(001F)]
[VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\nThis is your final assignment!\c\nBut first, my young friend...let us get the regular\nreports out of the way.\c\nMadam Wicke finished analyzing all of the data\nthat we gathered on the last UB you caught.\c\nIf you wish to learn more about that creature,\nthen you should speak with Madam Wicke in\r\nthe Aether Paradise secret labs!\c\nAnd now it is time we get to work.\nIf you need to ask me anything, I am here![VAR 0114(001F)]
I’ve finished sending the data from the UB you\nprotected to HQ. And to Ms. Wicke as well.\c\nThank you for your hard work, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].\c\nNow we will be able to learn all there is to know\nabout Guzzlord, otherwise known as UB Glutton.[VAR 0114(0029)]
We’ve done it, Chief.[VAR 0114(001F)]
Yes...\c\nwe have successfully contained all of the UBs.[VAR 0114(0029)]
Thank you so much for all of your hard work\non these missions, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]...[VAR 0114(0029)]
And Mr. Looker...[VAR 0114(0029)]
Not at all!\nAll I did was provide backup to the two of you.[VAR 0114(001F)]
It was all you and [VAR TRNAME(0000)], Chief.[VAR 0114(001F)]
And now that we have finally completed our\nmissions, I will treat us all to a feast of—[VAR 0114(001F)]
One moment please.[VAR 0114(0029)]
Wh-what is it, Chief?\c\nWe have finally reached it—our grand finale!\nWhich we should end with a big feast...[VAR 0114(001F)]
Our truly final mission requires that we go to\nAether Paradise and report to Ms. Wicke that\r\nwe have contained all of the UBs.[VAR 0114(0029)]
Oh! Indeed you are right!\nAnd we must thank her for the Poké Balls\r\nknown as Beast Balls![VAR 0114(001F)]
We will be going to Aether Paradise to report to\nMs. Wicke about our success.\c\nIf you are free, why don’t you come along as\nwell, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0029)]
We make for the secret labs in the lower floor\nof Aether Paradise!\c\nWhy don’t you join us, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]?[VAR 0114(001F)]

We have been waiting for you, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].[VAR 0114(0016)]
[VAR TRNAME(0000)], thank you for coming.[VAR 0114(0029)]
I’d like to thank you first for all of your hard\nwork containing the UBs.\c\nOn behalf of the entire foundation, I would like\nto offer you our most sincere thanks.\c\nWith this, all the UBs that appeared from the\nUltra Wormhole, which opened in the earlier\r\nincident, have been caught.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Oh no, we’re the ones who should be thanking\nyou, I think...\c\nWe could not have done it without the use of\nthe Beast Balls that you provided for us.[VAR 0114(0029)]
They are negative assets of the foundation...\nI am happy to see them put to some good use.\r\nI hardly know how I can thank the two of you...[VAR 0114(0016)]
The three of us
Don’t forget Looker
Yes, Mr. Looker also did a great deal to help us\nwith this mission.[VAR 0114(0029)]
But I thought that he left before us.\nWhat is taking him so long to get here?\c\nI know that I told him that we would meet here.\nCould something have happened?[VAR 0114(0029)]
Taihen da![VAR 0114(001F)]
R-really, Mr. Looker!\nEven after all this time...[VAR 0114(0029)]
I’m sorry!\nI know it’s a terrible habit, but I can’t help it!\r\nAnd more importantly...it’s a disaster![VAR 0114(001F)]
I would imagine it must be.\nWhat happened that made you so late?[VAR 0114(0029)]
I was on the way here when I stopped by\nMelemele Island to get some of their famous\r\nand delicious malasada as a gift for you all...[VAR 0114(001F)]
But just when I had finished my purchase,\nI chanced to look up at the sky and there...[VAR 0114(001F)]
there it was![VAR 0114(001F)]
A mysterious black...something was zipping\nacross the bright blue sky over Alola![VAR 0114(001F)]
It was black and yet it was shining somehow!\nIt was...it was like it was refracting light![VAR 0114(001F)]
It might have been a UB!\nNo, I’m certain of it! It surely was a UB![VAR 0114(001F)]
But it couldn’t be...\nWe haven’t had any word from HQ about there\r\nbeing more UBs![VAR 0114(0029)]
Please rest easy.\nI do not think it was a UB.\c\nWe have a hundred of our foundation members\nworking in parallel with the International Police\r\ninvestigation and scouring Alola for UBs.\c\nWe have not detected any UBs other than\nthe ones that you already contained for us.[VAR 0114(0016)]
So you see?\nWe should be quite safe now.[VAR 0114(0029)]
I...I suppose...\c\nPerhaps I was just dazzled by the brilliant,\nshining sky that stretches over Alola...[VAR 0114(001F)]
And it is little wonder if you were dazzled.\nYou all have been working so very hard.\c\nYou must be very tired, Mr. Looker.[VAR 0114(0016)]
W-well...yes, I suppose I could do with a nice\nlittle break...[VAR 0114(001F)]
And now you can have it.\c\nI received a message from HQ saying that our\npaid leave has been approved.[VAR 0114(0029)]
Paid leave?! You mean...actual vacation time?![VAR 0114(001F)]
They say we are free to do whatever we would\nlike until we get our next orders from HQ.\c\nI hope you will also use this chance to relax\nfor a little while, Mr. Looker.[VAR 0114(0029)]
I think that I will stay here and have a good\nlook around the Alola region.\c\nNot for work this time, but just as a regular\ntourist doing some sightseeing.[VAR 0114(0029)]
Then I think that I will go and eat my fill of\ndelicious Alolan cooking!\c\nThere are simply too many restaurants and\neateries that I wish to visit!\c\nAnd the traditional dishes at Sushi High Roller\nare absolutely sublime![VAR 0114(001F)]
Sushi...High Roller?[VAR 0114(0029)]
Oh no! I completely forgot!\nI was supposed to be meeting someone![VAR 0114(0029)]
What’s this?! A date?![VAR 0114(001F)]
N-no! Not a date!\nI am meeting with Mr. Nanu!\c\nWe owe him quite a bit for all his help![VAR 0114(0029)]
Yes...I suppose we do.[VAR 0114(001F)]
So if you will excuse me...\n[VAR TRNAME(0000)], everyone...\r\nI’m afraid I must be going.[VAR 0114(0029)]
But I really do thank you all.\nI hope we will all meet again someday![VAR 0114(0029)]
Yes, my young [VAR TRNAME(0000)]...\nI also owe you my thanks.\c\nIt was because of your efforts that we were\nable to keep the chief safe until the end.\c\nThe folks at HQ thought that you needed to be\npaid for your work, so they sent this. Take it.[VAR 0114(001F)]
And now...I think that it’s time I went.\c\nI’ll be staying at the motel on Melemele Island,\nthough, so feel free to stop by anytime.[VAR 0114(001F)]

Mm-hmm... Mm-hmm!
I know! Look at you!\nYou look like a Pokémon Trainer with sense!
I’ve got something I’d like to ask a promising-\nlooking Trainer like you!
What do you say?
I’m listening
I’d rather not...
Hmm... Hrmmmmmmm...\nWell, that is a real shame...
Oh! Oh, thank you!\nThat’s wonderfully kind of you!
You see, I’m here doing some research on\nvarious Pokémon.\c\nI need to record the differences between 10\nspecies of Pokémon for my survey sample,\r\nbut I’ve been working so hard and my back is\r\njust killing me...
But then you came along!\c\nYou look like a sensible young Trainer, which\nis just the sort of person I need to help me!\c\nI’d like to ask you to catch 10 different species\nof Pokémon for me.\r\nIt’s not too much to ask, right?
Oh! But—! Oh, look at you! Already?!\c\nYou’ve already caught more than 10 species of\nPokémon! Then show me!
Oh, yes. This is perfect!\c\nThis is all the data that I needed. Thank you!
Here. Why don’t you take this?\nAs a little thank-you for helping me out.
I’m really grateful for your assistance, my\nsensible young Trainer!\c\nI look forward to seeing what a promising young\ngo-getter like yourself gets up to!
Good luck out there!
I want you to catch 10 different species of\nPokémon for me.\r\nAny kind that you like. Just 10 different ones!

You defeated Olivia, didn’t you?\c\nTo commemorate your victory, I’ll give you a\nspecial item![VAR 0114(001B)]
The item I just gave you is a Reveal Glass.\c\nIt’s a looking glass that changes the shape\nof Tornadus, Thundurus, and Landorus.[VAR 0114(001B)]

You there!\nDo you know of the Pokémon called Genesect?[VAR 0114(002B)]
I do!
I don’t
Then I have no choice but to admit that you are\nall I would expect you to be![VAR 0114(002B)]
Then allow me to inform you![VAR 0114(002B)]
Genesect is a Pokémon that lived 300 million\nyears ago.\c\nThen an organization called Team Plasma\nmodified it, attaching a cannon to its back.[VAR 0114(002B)]
The cannon’s abilities could be activated using\ncertain drives created by the scientists in the\r\nP2 Laboratory.\c\nI think that you might be able to use them as\nthey should be used.[VAR 0114(002B)]
Simply believing in your Pokémon will not\nguarantee that you can do everything you want.\c\nBut there are many things that are guaranteed\nto fail if you do not believe in them.\c\nIt is the trust between a Trainer and a Pokémon\nalone that can overcome those hurdles![VAR 0114(002B)]
You there!\nYou should know that there is a battle facility\r\non Poni Island called the Battle Tree.\c\nI look forward to seeing what kinds of Trainers\nand Pokémon I can encounter there![VAR 0114(002B)]
You there!\nYou know that there is a battle facility\r\non Poni Island called the Battle Tree, don’t you?\c\nI look forward to seeing what kinds of battles\nyou might have there![VAR 0114(002B)]

What in the world is the secret of the pond in\nthis garden?
Oh! Listen to this! I’ve finally figured out the\nsecret of the pond in this garden!\c\nIf you could see this whole garden from above,\nthe pond here would look like a Pokémon!\c\nHow about I give you a little quiz?\nWhat kind of Pokémon does this pond look like?
Yungoos
Spinda
Pikachu
Crabrawler
Wingull
Mareanie
Gyarados
Pyukumuku
Sharpedo
I don’t know
Don’t just say you don’t know and give up!\nWhy don’t you try walking around the pond?
No way! You’re way off...\nWhy don’t you go have a good look at the pond?
Bingo! That’s it!\nGive the [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0403)]boygirl a prize!\c\nYou got the right answer! The pond in this\ngarden is totally shaped like a Gyarados!\r\nAnd to reward you...I’ll give you something nice!
And that’s the end of our quiz!\nGone as quick as an Air Balloon pops!\c\nMaybe I shouldn’t have made it a multiple-\nchoice quiz, after all. It was way too easy!
I wonder if whoever designed this garden really\nloved Gyarados or something?\r\nMaybe there’s some really deep meaning to it!

Ow! Arghhh!\c\nI’ve got dust in my eyes! Dust in my everywhere!\nEven my Pokémon are rubbing their eyes!
I’ve been getting so much dust in my eyes in\nthis awful desert, you know?\c\nAnd my Pokémon have been rubbing their\neyes a lot, too...\c\nHow are your Pokémon doing?\nAre their eyes holding up in this mess?
They’re burning brightly
They’re sniffling all the time
They’re looking pretty bleary
Well, that sounds like they might not be getting\nenough sleep. Warm them up and let them rest.
Wouldn’t that be their noses, not their eyes?\nIf they’ve got snot running down their faces,\r\nbe a good Trainer and wipe it away for them!
Well, that doesn’t sound good!\nI’ll give you these, so put ’em on your Pokémon.
This Haina Desert, though... It’s a beast.\nI’ve been wandering lost through it for...\r\nWell, I guess it’s been about a year now.\c\nWhen am I ever going to get out of here?
Ow! Arghhh!\c\nMore dust in my eyes! What I wouldn’t give for\na pair of Go-Goggles right about now...

This may be a bit sudden, coming from me,\nbut I’d like you to have these.
They are all Pokémon-related items that Madam\nLusamine planned to put in her collection...
If you like, I can tell you what any of them does.
DNA Splicers
Prison Bottle
Soul Dew
No need
Ah, the DNA Splicers...\c\nThey are said to be able to fuse a Pokémon\ncalled Kyurem with either Reshiram or Zekrom.
Yes, the Prison Bottle...\c\nApparently it allows a Pokémon called Hoopa\nto change its appearance.
Yes, Soul Dew...\c\nIf the Pokémon Latios or Latias holds it, the\npower of their Psychic- and Dragon-type moves\r\nwill both go up by 20%.
You can also view the explanations for any\nof the items by checking them out in your Bag.
But you know...\neven if it comes from the desire to keep all of\r\nyour beloved Pokémon beside you always...\c\nusing Pokémon moves to put them into a\ncryogenic sleep is too much.
The Pokémon who sleep now...\c\nI will keep them safe so that they can someday\nreturn to their previous state...

Tally-ho!\nHey, friend! Isn’t this beach just the best?\c\nThat’s what you’d think, right?
But you’d be dead wrong if you did!\nThis beach has a dark secret behind it...\c\nDo you know this beach’s true form?\nThe one it takes on in the dark of night?
Hah! So you do know!\c\nYou can’t really know this beach if you only\nsee it during the day. Oh no, you can’t!
We make sure that people can enjoy the beach!\nAnd that Pokémon can live in peace!\c\nAnd you can help us do both at once, with one\nfantastic part-time job! What do you say?
Fine, fine. I won’t force you or anything.\nI can try to keep chucking ’em all myself...
Oh! Thanks a mil’, pal!\nThis job really wears a person out, you know?\c\nCan you wait around here until they start\nappearing? Should be any moment now...
You see? They gather quick as anything and\nbury themselves in the sand of the beach.\c\nIf we leave them like that, the tourists end up\nstepping on them as they flock to the beach.\c\nSo every night we chuck ’em back into the sea\nso they get back home safe.
You watching? So the most important thing is\nthat you grab ’em good...
then spin around real good before letting go\nto chuck ’em right back into the sea!
Kinda like the hammer throw, you know?\nDo your best!
Chuck all the Pyukumuku that’re on the beach\nback into the sea!\c\nI’ll reward you for your hard work if you do!
Now they won’t have to get all dried out on\nthe beach. Mm-hmm!\c\nWe do this every night, so come back again\nanytime you want to help!
Phew... I’m beat!\c\nChucking all these Pyukumuku by myself is\nenough to leave me dizzy!
Pyuk! Pyuku!
You spun around 10 times and then flung the\nPyukumuku back into the sea!
Looks like that last one you chucked really was\nthe last one on the beach.
Thanks, friend!\c\nChucking all these critters by myself leaves me\ndizzy as I can take!\c\nAnd here’s your reward for helping.
Once they’ve come to like a place, those\nPyukumuku will just keep on coming back to it.\c\nSo we end up having to do this every single\nnight. Come help again anytime you feel like it!
You gonna give up without finishing the job?

That’s why I’ve been saying that he was\nkidnapped! Pokénapped! Whatever!\c\nI was just a little distracted while shopping...\nand someone must have taken advantage of\r\nthat moment to steal my little Rocky!\c\nIt is simply too adorable! That’s why!\nIt must have been stolen from me by someone!
Well, I wouldn’t say it MUST be that...\nThere could’ve been an accident...\r\nor it could be lost or could have run away...
Ex-CUSE me?!\c\nRun away?! My little Rocky?!\nNever in a million years!!!
Well, it certainly is missing.\nWe don’t refute that.\c\nSo the question is what to do next...
Pardon the intrusion. Captain Ilima here![VAR 0114(000C)]
Wuff!
Oh! Captain Ilima! How good of up you stop by.\nDid you need something from Hau’oli’s finest?
It seems this adorable little Pokémon is looking\nfor its Trainer.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Is it indeed! I see!\nThen this must be...
Wuff!
Oh! Oh-oh-oh!\nROCKY!!!
Wuuuffffff!!
Allow Captain Ilima to explain.\c\nI found this little bundle of fur waiting for\nsomeone outside the apparel shop for ages.[VAR 0114(000C)]
...Y-you did?\c\nWell, yes, I suppose I did tell Rocky to wait\noutside the shop so that I could focus on my\r\nshopping and trying on outfits...\c\nand then four hours passed before I knew it.\nI’d completely forgotten about poor Rocky...
...\c\nMa’am...
Sounds like you had a tough day, Rockruff.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Wuff!
I-I’m so sorry, Rocky!\nI did it again, didn’t I! I’m a terrible mother!
Wuff!!
I’m so sorry for troubling you all!\nI made all this fuss and it’s all my fault!\c\nPlease, I want you to accept this.\nI hope this whole thing can be our little secret.
W-well, that takes care of that!\nI think I will absent myself now!
Come, Rocky!\c\nI’m going to fix you a veritable feast as my\napology for forgetting about you yet again.
Wuuuff!
Looks like that Pokémon’s got more sense in\nits head than its Trainer has in hers.
There are all kinds of Trainers, just as there\nare all kinds of Pokémon.\c\nI’ll just see myself out now.\nGood seeing you, [VAR PKNAME(0000)].[VAR 0114(000C)]
Most of my work comes down to finding lost\nkids or Pokémon, or helping lost tourists.\c\nThe only thing we never seem to lose in Alola\nis the peace and quiet! Same goes for today!

All right! I’d say we’re about done, yeah?\nLet’s call it a day and get on home.
Griiime...
Hey! What are you doing out here, kid?!\nThis is a restricted area! We’re working here!
Seriously, boy? Aren’t you a Malie native?\nWe are famous for our hospitality! Tch!\c\nAnd kids need to explore and see the world.\nHow else are they gonna learn? I swear...
Y-yes, Fath—er...I mean...sir! Yes, sir!\c\nIf that’s what you really want...then I will tell this\nrandom trespasser about what it is we do here.
This is where we take care of all of the garbage\nproduced in the Alola region, young [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0403)]manlady.\c\nWe Janitors work together with our Pokémon\ntoward this goal, in fact.\c\nThe garbage that we human workers gather is\nconsumed by Muk and Grimer, like this one here.\c\nOur president here beside me has a Muk that\ncan eat 10 tons of rubbish in a single day!
Though, me and Grimer here are still just\ntemporary contract workers...
...But isn’t that an island challenge amulet you\nhave there?
I took on the trials myself, when I was a kid!\c\nThough...it was a bit too much for me, and so I\nactually ended up giving up right away...
Look here, kid.\c\nSeems to me that my Muk’s had a bit too much\nto eat today...
How about you join me in a battle and provide it\nwith a bit of exercise to aid the ol’ digestion?
I’d be happy to
Not right now
What, you got other plans or something?\nLet me know if you change your mind.
Good! You’ve got chutzpah, my friend!\nThen let’s get this thing happening!
Heh! Not too shabby...just like I’d figured!\nYou’ve got something in you, kid.
Amazing... You even beat my fa—\c\nI mean, my boss’s Muk...
What’re you doing standing there like a lump?!\nYou’re up next, you useless dullard!
Wh-what?! Me... Me and Grimer?!\nThere’s no way we could win against this kid!
You see! It’s just like you did with your trials\nwhen you were a kid!\c\nThe moment something starts to look tough,\nyou give a cry and off you run! You give up!\r\nAnd you’re supposed to be my son!\c\nHow can I leave this plant to you if you never\nlearn the value of a bit of hard work?\c\nI can’t ever leave things in your hands if you\ndon’t give me reason to trust you can handle it!
F-Father...
... ... ...\c\nFine! We’ll do it!
I will not run away anymore!\nI will give this everything that I’ve got!
Then I’ll take you on
Give me a minute
I’m counting on you, kid. Help me out here.
I am a man now!\c\nJust you watch, Father!\nI mean, sir!
Blast it all!
You...
I...I’m sorry, Father...\nI really am...just a weakling...
You’re hired!
F-Father?
I’m not your father! I’m your boss!\nAnd I’m saying that you are hired, boy!\c\nFrom this day forth, I’m making you the head\nof the plant! And I won’t hear another word of\r\ncomplaint about it from you!
Wha—?
You saw that this Trainer was stronger than\nyou or even me...\c\nand still you and your Grimer went up against\nh[VAR GENDBR(00FF,0202)]imer with everything that you had in you.\c\nThat’s what I’ve always wanted to see from you!\nThat kind of persistence and drive!\c\nAnd that’s why you and Grimer...\nThat’s why you’re going to take over for me.
Th-thank you, sir! Father, sir!\nI mean, Mr. Former President, sir!
Sorry for using you to teach my boy a lesson.\c\nBut when I saw that island challenge amulet\nyou had there, it just hit me, you know?\c\nTake this for your troubles.\nIt may be twisted, but it’s not garbage!
Now that I’ve got my successor sorted out,\nI can finally retire to a life of peace and quiet.\c\nI think I can trust my boy’s crew to keep\non eating up all of Alola’s garbage from now on!
Yes, sir! You can, sir!
You again, young trial-goer!\c\nThanks again for helping me set my son to\nrights before.
Me and my Grimer have been working really\nhard ever since then.\c\nYou do your best, too.\nI’ll be hoping you succeed in your own dreams!
Gri-i-ime...

Hey there, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\nLooks like you’re really givin’ it your all. Yeah!\c\nYou’ve got a lot of Pokémon registered in your\nPokédex now![VAR 0114(0005)]
Of course [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0100)]she hazzz!\n[VAR TRNAME(0000)] izzz my [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0B07)]big boyclever girl!\c\nI wouldn’t bother hanging out with some lug of a\nTrainer who couldn’t fill a Pokédex! Zz-zz-zz![VAR 0114(0035)]
Hahaha! Rotom’s pretty fired up about it, too!\nOf course, I am, too! So I’ve got a little\r\nsomething for you.[VAR 0114(0005)]
When you have a Pokémon hold a Lucky Egg,\nit grows up faster! Some evolved Pokémon\r\ndon’t appear in the wild, so it’s useful to have\r\none of these if you’re trying to fill a Pokédex.[VAR 0114(0005)]

Well...I’m afraid that the little kerfuffle we went\nthrough resulted in my demotion.\c\nI am turning over a new leaf and beginning over\nas one of the rank and file.\c\nWhen all is said and done, I feel like I’ve become\na completely different person. In mind and body.[VAR 0114(0015)]
Could the new and improved Faba request a\nbattle with you?[VAR 0114(0015)]
Of course
I’d rather not
Then here I come!\nThe new and improved Faba makes his debut![VAR 0114(0015)]
No! Does my new and improved form so\nintimidate you?[VAR 0114(0015)]
So what did you think of the new and improved\nFaba, hmm?\c\nWith my newfound charm, you will see me\nmake my comeback within the foundation!\c\nAnd for that I will have to gain quite a bit of\nsupport behind me.[VAR 0114(0015)]
That is just a little token from me,\nso you won’t forget the new Faba.\c\nNow watch as I work my way up the ladder of\nthe foundation once more![VAR 0114(0015)]
When I was reduced to this low-ranking\nposition, I had a sudden revelation.\c\nI desperately long for that title of respect![VAR 0114(0015)]

Um, hey, sorry, but...\nYou’re part of Sis’s crew, right? 
Sis?
Crew?
Oh, uh, sorry, guess I should explain...\nSee, I’m apprenticing here to become a cook.\c\nAnd Sis is the owner’s daughter. Mallow.\nHer family owns this restaurant, you know?
Oh, uh, sorry. I was in Team Skull, you know?\nSo I got kinda used to talking like that, yeah?\c\nI mean, you’re one of Mallow’s friends, right?\nI’m apprenticing here to become a cook.
Anyway, Mallow asked me to give you these.
She said it was your reward for becoming the\nChampion, you know?\c\nBut she’s kinda shy, you know?\nSo she gave ’em to me to give to you.\c\nOh, but she told me I shouldn’t tell you that.\nSo forget about it—you got that?
Mallow, like, totally saved me.\nI wouldn’t be here if it weren’t for her.\c\nShe got me this job when Team Skull fell apart\nand I had nowhere left to go.\c\nOh, but she didn’t want me to tell anyone about\nthat either ’cause she’s so modest. Huh.
I’m gonna do my best now, and I’m gonna \nbecome a real chef. You’ll see!

You’re [VAR TRNAME(0000)]?\nThank you for helping out our Mallow.\c\nOh. I know!\c\nHere. Take this for stopping by.\c\nI already used it for making stock, but that\nshouldn’t stop your Pokémon from enjoying it.
It’s good to give Dragon-type Pokémon a\nDragon Fang to hold on to.\c\nThough we cooks tend to use them for rather\ndifferent purposes, as you can see!
I hope you and Mallow will stay friends!

Hey there, Trainer!\nYou can call me Future.\c\nPeople call me the sound-making machine that\ncan make the hits of the not-so-distant future.\c\nAnd this here beside me is my partner, Hit.
Ruff ruff!
Puppy Pokémon can be pretty scatterbrained,\nalways barking up the wrong tree at things,\r\nbut you can’t beat their beautiful cries!
Rauuuuuu!
See? Thanks to this clever girl, and her lovely\nvoice, writing new songs is as easy as pie!\c\nI know I probably don’t even need to ask, but...\nYou have heard of me before, right?
Never have
Not till today
Whoa! That is bad news for you, friend!\nYou are clearly behind on the times!
I guess I’ll make sure people know who I am!\nIf not through songs, then through battle!
All right
I’m fine not knowing you
Well, whenever you want to get a taste for the\nfuture, you are always welcome to come back!
That’s the tune I’ve been waiting to hear!\nI hope you’re ready to face Future!
Would you look at that, Hit?\nThis Trainer is amazing!\c\nI think I’ve thought of my next future hit melody\nthanks to that battle!
Raaauuu!
Look at that! Even Hit is getting excited!\nShe’s normally so laid-back about everything!\c\nLet me give you a little present to thank you\nfor this dose of inspiration!
That Metronome right there is a key tool if you\nhope to capture the song of the future!\c\nI don’t know how to use it for battling though!\nYou’ll have to tune in to that for yourself!
My music is going to shape the future!\nThat’s my dream!

I am a Trainer who uses the Red Card item.\nI want to be shaken by your strength...\c\nI want to face you when you’ve shown that you\ncan defeat every last Trainer on Route 3!
So you’ve defeated all of the Trainers along\nRoute 3, have you?\c\nYou have shaken me from my calm repose!\nMy heart was a still water, but no longer!
I feel my heart trembling!\nSo you’ve come again!
Shall we start?\nLet’s have a soul-shaking battle!
I accept
I refuse
My soul is calm and unruffled.
That is a good reply.
I will stand before you as a Red Card user!
It was a fine battle.\c\nMy heart feels as light and clear as the blue\nsky that appears after a storm passes through.
This is proof of the battle between your team\nand my own.\c\nA Red Card! Take it, my strong friend!
The effects of the Red Card are as I illustrated\nto you in battle.\c\nYou will likely find other Trainers like me on\nthe routes of Alola. Searching for strength.\c\nChallenging them together with your Pokémon\nwould not be a bad reason to take a journey. 
What’s that? You want to battle me even when\nI’m using my full force?\c\nFine. Then beat every other Trainer on Route 8\nand we can talk.
You beat all of the Trainers along Route 8?\c\nThen it looks like it’s finally my time to shine!
What a wicked little Trainer you are for making\nme wait like that...
Now let’s get this thing started, shall we?
Yes, please!
No, wait!
If you make me wait too long then I’ll run out\nof power for my full-force attacks!
Then here I go!
It’s time for me and my Pokémon’s\nZ-powered performance!
Well, that’s the end of me and my Pokémon’s\nZ-powered performance!
Thanks for taking part in the show!\nTake this with you as a souvenir!
I bet you can find other full-force Trainers like\nme on the routes of Alola looking for strong\r\nfoes to take on in battle.\c\nWouldn’t it be fun to take a little detour and\nsearch them all out?
Looks like you’re a fellow Trainer who can use\nZ-Power in battle.\c\nLet’s find out whose full-force strength is the,\nuh, fullest!\c\nBeat all of the Trainers in this tunnel if you\nthink you can take me on!
Looks like you did what I asked and beat all of\nthe Trainers in this tunnel, huh?\c\nWell then, my Z-powered challenger...\c\ndo you want to compare Z’s with me?\nWe’ll see whose Z is the best!
I’ve been waiting for you!\nTrainer who can wield the full force of Z-Power!
Then let us have a Z-battle to Z-prove who\nhas the best Z-moves!
Let’s start
Hold on
Being cautious, are you?\nThen you must not have a lot of Z-Power!
That’s a good answer. But I hope you’re ready.\nMy Z-Power is not to be trifled with!
Our full-force Z-Power competition begins now!
Very well done! That is some real Z-Power!\nYour Z is the most Z of any Z!
Let me award you with this token to show how\nhighly I value and respect your Z!
There are probably other Z-Trainers like me out\nand about in Alola.\c\nIf you want to achieve the ultimate in Z, then\nsearch them out and challenge them all.
I am the one known as the kahuna of Route 12!\c\nIf you hope to battle me, then beat every other\nTrainer on Route 12 first!
It appears you have completed your training\nand defeated Route 12’s other Trainers...\c\nThen I, the kahuna of Route 12, will honor you\nwith a battle!
I’ve been waiting for you.\nMy reckless little challenger.
I’ll show you the Z-Power of a Route 12 kahuna!
Let’s do it
I’m not ready...
And I was just getting warmed up, too!\nCome on, kid. Don’t make me wait too long...
Hee hee hee...\nSo you think you’re ready, do you?
This is the devastating Z-Power of the great\nkahuna of Route 12!
Rgh!\nI have been...done in...
I yield to you the title of Route 12 kahuna...\nand this as well...
I cannot allow myself to be satisfied with the\ntitle of kahuna in such a small area as this...\c\nI think it’s time that I start setting my goals\non the wider world as well!
Let me guess. You were wondering what a\nGolfer would be doing in a meadow like this.\c\nIf you want an answer to that question, then\ndefeat all of the Trainers in this meadow first.
Ho! Congratulations to you!\nYou’ve beat all the Trainers in the meadow!\c\nThen I’ll tell you why I am here...\c\nI am here waiting for a worthy Trainer like you!
Ho! So you’ve come again?\nI’ve been practicing my swing as I wait for you!
So what do you say?\nWill you have a Pokémon battle against me?
I will
No thanks
What, really?\nCome on! We should have a battle!
My special strategy hinges on my use of an\nitem called the Flame Orb!
This Golfer’s on fire!\nHere comes my full-powered best shot!
Mm-hmm. Just as I’d thought...\c\nYou have what it takes to be the next wielder\nof my precious Flame Orb...\c\nMm-hmm!\nI’m glad that I waited here for you so long.
Take it...my Flame Orb...
There! And that’s that!\c\nI don’t know if it’s simply a part of getting older,\nbut lately I’ve been completely hooked on golf.\c\nI’d gotten a bit burnt out as a Trainer and could\nno longer use that Flame Orb as I should have.\c\nUsing it wisely takes a bit of tricky thinking, but\nif you figure it out, it’ll pay you back in spades!
It takes a great deal of endurance and spirit\nto keep dancing without any pause. ♪\c\nIf you’d like to battle me, then you’ll have to\nshow that you have the endurance and spirit\r\nto rout all of the Trainers in the area first. ♪
Lovely. So you’ve defeated all the other Trainers\naround here, have you? ♪\c\nIt looks like you’ve got endurance and spirit. ♪

Yeah, sure, no problem.\nI’ll be waiting here, so come back whenever.
I’d heard that the latest batch of trial-goers\nare a feisty lot. I’ve been looking forward to this!
This ol’ Trial Guide’s little trial is about to start!
That’s the end of my little trial!\nPhewee, you’ve got some solid skills, kid!
Yup, I’ve got to congratulate you on this win!\nHere’s a reward for clearing my little trial!
Seeing you young kids giving it your all like that...\c\nyou all shine as bright as the sun over Alola!\c\nThis may just be a volunteer position, but I’m\nsure glad that I decided to be a Trial Guide.
I’m one of the Trial Guides that are here to help\nyou kids out during your island challenge.\c\nBut the job that I was tasked with is actually\nto test how your skills are coming along.\c\nSo why don’t you show me you can beat every\nlast Trainer on Route 15? Then come back here.
Looks like you didn’t waste much time going\nthrough all the Trainers on Route 15!\c\nIf you’re that good, then I guess I’ll pull out my\nZ-Power, too.
Hey! Back again?\nHow’s it going, little trial-goer?
Think you can take on my little trial?
Yes, please
Not yet
You sure you’re up to this?\nPrepare real good before you come back.
I like your spirit, kid.\nI think I’m getting fired up, too!
Then the full-powered little trial of this trial\nguide is about to start!
Nice! You cleared my little trial.\nYou’re a real tough little trial-goer.
Here’s your reward from me.\nTake it and carry on with your adventure!
All the trial-goers I see out and about on their\nisland challenges have such great smiles...\c\nThey’re as beautiful as the brilliant moon that\nhangs in Alola’s night sky.\c\nThe work doesn’t pay a lick, but I can’t give it\nup when it lets me see those happy faces.
What? You want a little tête–à–tête with a\nZ-Ring user like yours truly?\c\nThen become the number two Trainer in all of\nPoni Plains, baby.
Looks like you managed to claw your way up\nto the number two spot in Poni Plains, huh?\c\nThen I guess you’ve earned a little rendezvous\nwith the number-one Trainer: me!
Hey, number two!\nYou planning to make me wait forever?
What do you say?\nIs it time for our little showdown?
Let’s battle!
Not yet!
OK...but I’m not going anywhere.\nThe number-one Trainer doesn’t run away.
You can’t just choose the cool-looking Pokémon\nand think you can win...
The full power of the number-one Trainer is\ngoing to finish you off for the day!
Oh, baby! I’ve gotta give you a hand!\nYou are worthy of being the next number one!
So here you go, babe.\nA little present from me!
There aren’t too many Trainers who’ve mastered\nusing their Z-Powers.\c\nSo don’t forget I’m one of those special few!\nPlease, baby!
Sorry, youngster, but I can’t fight you.\c\nMy Pokémon is like a brother to me.\nAnd he’s not interested in battling weaklings.\c\nIf you want me to ask him to fight against you,\nthen beat all the Trainers on Mount Hokulani.
Are you the one who defeated all the Trainers\non Mount Hokulani then?\c\nAll right then. Fair enough.\nI like kids with a bit of pep.
Made me wait, didn’t you?
I’ll be using my Z-Power against you.\nYou ready for a scuffle?
Sure I am
Not yet
Hmph. Fine, kid.
I think I feel something coming over me...
Sorry, kid, but my Pokémon doesn’t know the\nmeaning of the word “moderation!”
You...\nYou’ve got some good Pokémon, kid.
Thanks for showing my brother a good time.\nHere’s your thanks.
You know, Z-Power is more or less the power\nof the pledge you’ve made to your Pokémon.\c\nAnd my relationship with my Pokémon is closer\nthan that of a parent or a brother or anything.

Young Master Gladion is doing a fine job as\nthe acting president of the foundation.\c\nBut don’t you think it would be more appropriate\nto have an adult like me fill the position...?[VAR 0114(0015)]
You’re right
You think so?
You are surprisingly intelligent for a child![VAR 0114(0015)]
This is why I hate dealing with child—\c\nEr, I mean...\c\nI find it so interesting talking with children.[VAR 0114(0015)]

So you came...[VAR 0114(0013)]
I guess I’ve got to thank you again for all you’ve\ndone for my family...\c\nEspecially...for Lillie.\c\nI never knew she could smile like that.[VAR 0114(0013)]
My mother’s desires to reach Nihilego...\nand what she did in order to achieve that goal...\r\nI know she was completely out of control.\r\nBut that doesn’t mean I can’t understand it.[VAR 0114(0013)]
It was my father who started it.\c\nHe was the one who first confirmed the\nexistence of Ultra Wormholes and Ultra Beasts.[VAR 0114(0013)]
But my father...\c\nHe disappeared during an experiment.\nTrying to connect to an Ultra Wormhole.\c\nAll that he left behind was a weakened Cosmog\nand his papers about Nihilego...[VAR 0114(0013)]
Lusamine’s obsession with Ultra Wormholes...\nand her obsession with the Ultra Beasts...\c\nI think it was all basically her way of trying to\nreach him again.\r\nThat’s what I had to believe. To get through it.[VAR 0114(0013)]
It’s not an apology or anything, but...\nI hope you’ll take this fellow.[VAR 0114(0013)]
[~ 7]
And I’ll give you all the memory drives that let\nits Evolution, Silvally, change its type...[VAR 0114(0013)]
You received a whole stack of memory drives!
This is a different Type: Null.\nNot the same one that I ran away with...\c\nIt was kept in Secret Lab A. Its very existence\nwas a secret.[VAR 0114(0013)]
But I think I know you well enough.\nI think I can trust you to show it the world.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Hmph...\c\nMaybe it’s time I see a bit more of the\nworld myself...\c\nand starting with that Pokémon League, I think.\c\nI hear that Alola’s got a real strong Champion.[VAR 0114(0013)]
You can’t even take Type: Null?\nHow many Pokémon have you collected?\c\nI can’t even believe you...\c\nFine. Come back when you’re ready to take it.[VAR 0114(0013)]

[VAR TRNAME(0000)].\nWelcome back.[VAR 0114(0016)]
I have to tell you how much I appreciate what\nyou did for Miss Lillie and Madam Lusamine.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Miss Lillie asked me a last favor before she left.\c\nShe wanted me to explain to you why\nshe and her mother had to go to Kanto.[VAR 0114(0016)]
You see...\c\nwhile we do not know if it was because of\nNihilego’s neurotoxins, her fusion with that\r\nbeast, or the strain of the Z-Power...[VAR 0114(0016)]
the ill effects of this episode on Madam\nLusamine’s body and mind have been undeniable.\r\nShe has hardly roused since.[VAR 0114(0016)]
But Miss Lillie found a ray of hope in a book\nthat she remembered reading long ago.[VAR 0114(0016)]
It was regarding a man named Bill, who invented\nthe Pokémon Storage System used in our PCs.[VAR 0114(0016)]
This inventor, who lives in the Kanto region,\nonce combined himself with a Pokémon in an\r\nexperiment that apparently went awry...[VAR 0114(0016)]
Just like Lusamine...
Why would he do that?
Yes, perhaps there are even more examples in\nthe world of people fusing with Pokémon...[VAR 0114(0016)]
I suppose it was the same sort of curiosity\nthat led him to develop our storage system.[VAR 0114(0016)]
The records of this event, however, say that\nhe was separated from the Pokémon by using\r\nhis Teleporter and a Cell Separation System.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Perhaps using the same kind of procedure on\nMadam Lusamine will be able to remove the\r\nlast of the beast’s poisons from her system.\c\nThat is what Miss Lillie was hoping when she\nheaded to Kanto.[VAR 0114(0016)]
It pained me greatly when both Miss Lillie and\nyoung Master Gladion left Aether Paradise...\c\nbut I am so proud to see the fine young people\nthat they have become.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Even sheltered little Master Gladion tried to\npatch up his own clothing, he said, when his\r\npartner Null tore them...[VAR 0114(0016)]
Oh! I’m sorry. You probably aren’t interested\nin hearing about that sort of thing, are you?\c\nHere, please accept this.[VAR 0114(0016)]
... ... ...\c\nOh! And take another, too![VAR 0114(0016)]
Now I’ll be returning to Secret Lab B so that\nI can get back to work.[VAR 0114(0016)]

How are you, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0027)]
Zygarde at 100%...\nYou might be able to control it fully![VAR 0114(0027)]
If you collect all Cells and Cores, please visit the\nAether Base on Route 16 on Ula’ula Island.\c\nUse the Reassembly Unit there, and you can\ntransform them into a Zygarde![VAR 0114(0027)]
While we were having you look into Zygarde\nfor us...[VAR 0114(0026)]

It’s so mysterious...\c\nto be talking about Mega Evolution here, in a\nregion so far away from Kalos...[VAR 0114(0026)]
But we are Trainers.\c\nRather than explaining it all in words, why don’t\nwe just show you what Mega Evolution is![VAR 0114(0027)]
The Trainer holds the Key Stone!\c\nThe Pokémon holds the Mega Stone!\c\nAnd that’s how you can make your Pokémon\nMega Evolve during battle![VAR 0114(0027)]
You can use the Z-Ring!\c\nSo you must be able to use a Key Stone that\nmakes Mega Stones resonate![VAR 0114(0026)]
If you have a Key Stone, you’ll be able to make\nyour Pokémon that hold a Mega Stone\r\nMega Evolve![VAR 0114(0027)]
This is a Mega Stone that makes Alakazam\nMega Evolve. It’s called an Alakazite!\c\nI’ll give the Key Stone and an Alakazite to you![VAR 0114(0027)]
You know, when you think about it...\c\nThe Z-Ring helps the feelings of a Trainer\nreach his or her Pokémon and makes it so it\r\ncan use its Z-Power, right?\c\nIt only follows that it should be able to achieve\nMega Evolution, too![VAR 0114(0026)]

Pokémon you catch in a Heal Ball will have their\nHP restored to its maximum level.\r\nThey are also cured of any status conditions.
You can heal your Pokémon of effects like\npoisoning by treating them with the medicine\r\nto be found in Pokémon Refresh!

A captain is tasked with supporting all those\nwho undertake the island challenge.\r\nSo naturally we have to be strong Trainers.[VAR 0114(000C)]
Attack power is the key to anything!\c\nIf you use an X Attack in battle, you can\ndefeat a very tough opponent!\c\nHere. I’ll give you one to try for yourself.
An X Attack will sharply raise your Pokémon’s\nAttack stat, helping you defeat most other\r\nPokémon hands down!
Defense is everything in battle!\c\nIf you use an X Defense, your opponent’s\nattacks will practically bounce right off you!\c\nHere. I’ll give you one to try for yourself.
An X Defense will sharply raise your Pokémon’s\nDefense stat, letting you take most any attack\r\nwithout breaking a sweat!

Phew... Time for a little rest, I think.\c\nRiding may be easier on me, but that doesn’t\nmean my Pokémon doesn’t get tired!
If you go ahead through the grass here you can\nreach the cemetery where Pokémon rest.\r\nMany Trainers visit it to pay their respects.
If a Pokémon’s move lands as a critical hit,\nit will deal 50% more damage!

We occasionally ask Professor Kukui to run a\nspecial class for our school.\c\nHe’s done a great deal of research into Pokémon\nmoves, after all.
Pokémon moves have PP. Um. Power Points.\c\nIf the PP for a move runs out, your Pokémon\nwon’t be able to use it anymore.\c\nNot till you get it restored, I mean. And you can\njust take it to a Pokémon Center for that!
Who do you think picks up all the Poké Balls\nyou throw that don’t catch any Pokémon?
I can read! Here, watch.\c\n“Moves have types, just like Pokémon...\c\n“If you use a move that’s the same type as your\nPokémon, it will get a special boost in power!”
Petting my Pokémon makes me happy, too!
There is writing on the blackboard.\nIt describes how types match up.\c\nGrass is weak to Fire.\nWater is weak to Grass.\r\nFire is weak to Water.\c\nThere are many more types, too, and they have\ntheir own weaknesses, just like these three.
Healing Your Pokémon\nWhen your Pokémon are injured or suffering \nfrom some status condition, either get them to\na Pokémon Center or use the appropriate \nmedicines on them!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Abilities are basically special skills all Pokémon\nhave that can make special things happen.\c\nTake the Ability called Limber, for example...\c\nAny Pokémon who has that Ability won’t ever\nbe paralyzed by an opponent’s moves!
When you begin to level up as a Trainer and\nlearn advanced strategies, you’ll want to pay\r\nattention to Abilities. They can be a huge help!
All Pokémon have some sort of Ability...\c\nBut even members of the same species don’t\nalways have the same Ability as one another.\c\nWhich Ability you’ll want your Pokémon to have\nwill depend somewhat on how you like to battle.
Let’s see here...\c\nSo, if you choose to view a Pokémon’s summary,\nyou can see what Ability that Pokémon has.\c\nWhen you touch the “i” for more information,\nyou can see what that Ability does.\c\nMaybe I’d remember it all better if the textbook\nwasn’t written to be so boring!
My Lillipup picked this up.\nHere, you take it.
Lillipup’s Ability is Pickup!\c\nIt’s an awesome Ability that works even when\nyou’re not in battle.\c\nI went all the way to Akala Island to find a\nLillipup and catch it just to have this Ability.
There is writing on the blackboard.\c\nIt describes some of the physical changes that\na Pokémon can experience in battle.
What would you like to read about?
If a Pokémon is poisoned, it will steadily lose HP\nduring battle.\c\nThe poison won’t disappear after the battle\neither, so heal poisoning with an Antidote.
Paralysis reduces Speed and may prevent\nPokémon from using any moves.\c\nParalysis also lingers after battle, so use a\nParalyze Heal to clear up its nasty effects.
If a Pokémon falls asleep, it will be unable to\nattack till it wakes.\c\nThe Pokémon may wake up on its own, but if\nthe battle ends first, then it will stay asleep.\c\nYou can wake it up using an Awakening.
Burns lower a Pokémon’s Attack and steadily\nreduce their HP. They linger even after battle.\c\nYou can cure burns using a Burn Heal.
If a Pokémon is frozen, it becomes completely\nhelpless.\c\nIt may thaw out on its own, but if the battle\nends first, it will remain frozen thereafter.\c\nYou can thaw it out using an Ice Heal.
Poisoning
Paralysis
Falling asleep
Getting burned
Being frozen
Never mind
On How to Trigger Abilities\nMethod 1: An Ability may be triggered when the\nPokémon appears in a battle, and its effects will\nthen continue as long as that Pokémon remains\nin the battle.\c\nMethod 2: An Ability may be triggered when the\nPokémon takes an attack from an opponent.\n\nMethod 3: An Ability may be triggered when the\nPokémon is not in a Pokémon battle.

Slowpoke’s Yawn is a move that can put\nyour opponent to sleep in battle.\c\nWhen a Pokémon is asleep, it can’t do anything\nuntil it wakes up, so it can give you a chance\r\nagainst a Pokémon you’re having trouble with.
Ya-a-awn...

He’s too soft on young Hau.\c\nWhen Hau was just a little thing, he once saw\nHala in a real fury and Old Hala’s face was\r\nso terrible then that the boy burst into tears!\r\nHala couldn’t do a thing to console him.\c\nI think he’s been holding something of himself\nback in front of Hau ever since that day.

Professor Burnet was previously studying a\ndimensional space called the Interdream Zone.
There was a man named Mohn, who years ago\npublished his theory about the Ultra Wormholes.
Palkia:\nIts total control over the boundaries of space\nenable it to transport itself to faraway places\nor even other dimensions.
Giratina:\nThis Pokémon is said to live in a world on the\nreverse side of ours, where common knowledge\nis distorted and strange.
Bronzong:\nIt brought rains by opening portals to another\nworld. It was revered as a bringer of plentiful\nharvests.

We welcome you gladly to the grandiose\nHano Grand Hotel!
I’m one of the bellhops.\nRing the bell and I’ll hop up to serve you!
I’m the hotel detective for this establishment.\c\nBut the people in Alola are so easygoing that\nnothing troublesome ever happens around here.\r\nThere’s nothing for me and my Kadabra to do.
Salandit’s poisonous gas smells as sweet as any\nflower, but breathe it in and you’re done for.\c\nI’ve tried watering it down to use it in perfume,\nbut I’m not having any luck...
Whether it’s your golf swing or your battle skills,\nit’s hard to improve without a bit of guidance.
I’ve been learning so much about my game from\nMiss Kahili. She is a real golf pro.
Mowr?
Alola is how we say hello.\nAlola is how we say farewell.\r\nMay the love of sun and moon shine upon you!
The touch of the Alola breeze\nfeels like being wrapped in kindness.\r\nWait, and feel it blow over you...
Alola is the land where I was born.\nAlola is the home I was born into.\r\nWelcome, and please feel at home as well!
A good Pokémon will listen to what others think\naround it and then discover its own mind.\r\nThe same goes for a good woman, too.
Listen, kid: If you don’t throw common sense\nout the window sometimes, you’ll never be able\r\nto discover anything new.\c\nTry everything out: different Abilities, moves,\nitems... That’s how you make a breakthrough!
I can’t make any recommendations on behalf\nof the hotel, but I can tell you this...\c\nWhatever type of Pokémon that your Pokémon\nare weak to, you should have other Pokémon on\r\nyour team that are effective against that type!
The owner of the Hano Grand Resort is a great\ngolf fan.\c\nAnd his daughter, Miss Kahili, is a world-class\nGolfer herself! And a real strong Trainer, too.
Would you look at this thing?\nIt totally looks like an Oddish, right?

Getting targeted by all the other Trainers is\nproof that you’re the strongest!\c\nBut even so, you can’t win in a Battle Royal if\nall you do is protect yourself all the time!
The Battle Royal format is fun because you\ndon’t know who your allies are.

The Legendary Pokémon and the Tapu\nA great and terrible battle waged between the\ntapu and the Legendary Pokémon, but neither\nside could claim victory over the other.\c\nUpon finding themselves equals, the Legendary\nPokémon then gifted the tapu with great power\nof unknown providence.
The Guardian Deities of the Islands\nThe tapu regularly keep themselves closed tight\nin their shells as they absorb nature’s energy.\nAfter many long years of absorbing such energy,\ntheir shells become hard and sturdy.
The Tapu and the Island Kahunas\nThe tapu choose the kahunas of their islands\nand entrust them with special sparkling stones.\nWhat reasoning they use to make such a choice,\nhowever, is not at all apparent to observers.
The Guardians and the Ancient Kings\nIn ancient times, the tapu served as the leaders\nof the armies of each island’s king, but if they\nused their Z-Power in battle, it caused great\ndestruction across the islands.\c\nBecause of this, the tapu came to no longer\nlend their aid in the wars of men.

The Generator\c\nThe steam turbines spin at a speed of 3,600\nrevolutions per minute, powering the generator\r\nand producing electricity.\c\nIt may seem like the generator organ in Vikavolt,\nbut it works on an entirely different principle.
The Cooling Tower\c\nThis is where the water from the steam used\nby the generator cools.\c\nOnce the water has been cooled sufficiently, it\ncan then be reused to cool more steam.
Producing Geothermal Energy: Step 1\c\nWith the help of digging Pokémon, scientists\nsearch for underground steam vents in the\r\narea around active volcanoes.
Producing Geothermal Energy: Step 2\c\nOver a long period of time, and with the help of\nmany Pokémon that can work underground,\r\nthe power plant is constructed.
Producing Geothermal Energy: Step 3\c\nThe steam that is naturally produced due to\nunderground heat is used to turn turbines and\r\ngenerate electricity.
Producing Geothermal Energy: Step 4\c\nThe Geothermal Power Plant produces clean\nenergy that is good for the environment, thanks\r\nto its relatively small carbon footprint.
There are souvenirs on sale with the Geothermal\nPower Plant’s logo, like towels and things.
There are souvenirs on sale, like postcards with\npictures of the Geothermal Power Plant and\r\nsnacks made by cooking Berries in the steam\r\nthat erupts from Blush Mountain!

When Pokémon are injured in the wild, they\ntend to hide themselves away somewhere.\c\nThat is so that they can recover in a place\nwhere they’ll be safe from further harm.\c\nBut sometimes they need more care than that.\nWe search them out and care for them so that\r\nthey don’t lose their lives alone in the wild.\c\nEven though they are incredibly on-edge and\nit’s quite dangerous to approach them.

This is the blog of F, a branch chief working in\nthe Alola region.\c\nTitle: Hedging risks\c\nI once ventured to undertake a project without\nnotifying my superior.\c\nI developed a device to restrain a dangerous life\nform, in case it became necessary to do so.\c\nI had it made for hedging risks to protect\nmyself, but for better or worse, it was\r\nmade public.\c\nIt is always essential to consider the risks\nbefore one takes action.
This is the blog of F, a branch chief working in\nthe Alola region.\c\nTitle: Massaging the truth\c\nMy superior’s family stole the results of our\nresearch and ran off.\c\nHowever, I have chosen to never blow this issue\nout of proportion.\c\nI will only be reprimanded for my own mistakes,\nand surely my superior is also displeased with\r\nthe actions of her family as well.\c\nWhen necessary, one must always be prepared\nto massage the truth to protect one’s own\r\nposition. It is not an exaggeration to say that\r\nthis skill is vital for success.
