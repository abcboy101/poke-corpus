[VAR 0205]UNOWN Report
[VAR 0103(0000,0000)]
[VAR 0205] Number of UNOWN
[VAR 0205]Current Kinds: [VAR 0133(0000,0000)]
[VAR 0205][VAR 0132(0000,0000)]/[VAR 0132(0001,0000)]
Found a strange puzzle in the\nruins. Solved it, and suddenly a\nhole opened up in the ground\nand I dropped into the room\nbelow! Should have known that\nancient ruins would have\nsurprising tricks like that.
There was a stone statue where I\nfell. The place might have been a\nreception hall. Then, suddenly,\nthe UNOWN appeared. That puzzle\nwas like a key somehow. It woke\nthe UNOWN up from their sleep.\nThese ruins have become difficult.
If you turn on the radio in the\nruins, you can receive mysterious\nradio waves! It's proof that the\nUNOWN communicate with each\nother using radio waves!
There are as many UNOWN as there\nare letters in the alphabet.\nRight now, we're confirming the\nexistence of 26 kinds of UNOWN.\nDo you think you can find\nall 26 of them?
It seems that individually they\ndon't make much sense, but when\nthe various UNOWN are arranged\nin order, they begin to make\nsense. In nature, they seem to be\nscattered around randomly, but\nthe truth is they're arranged in\na very specific order.
In this report, the scattered\nUNOWN were sorted and put into\norder by the research-center\nstaff. That makes the UNOWN much\neasier to understand.
Scratched on the floor of the\nruins are UNOWN letters. Finding\nthe room feels like a huge\ndiscovery! The Researchers were\nvery excited and said they were\ngoing to go check it out.
There aren't just 26 different\nkinds of UNOWN. Two more have\nbeen discovered! But that begs\nthe question of where those\nother two kinds are hiding...
[VAR 0204(0018)]The characters found scratched\non the floor in the small room are\ntranscribed here in this report.
[VAR 0204(0048)]OUR FRIENDS LOOK\nUP AND HEARTILY\nCONGRATULATE US
[VAR 0204(0078)]We don't know what this could\npossibly mean yet.
The Researchers were saying\nthat they'll need to examine the\nruins again, but...?
In the past, it seems that UNOWN\nlived with relatives of humans in\nthese ruins. In the lower levels\nof these ruins is a Pokémon\nstatue. We've come to understand\nthat it was those relatives who\nmade that statue.
The UNOWN are very timid\ncreatures, so they don't go\noutside the ruins. Even if a bunch\nof people gathered near the\nruins, it is said that the ones who\nwished for UNOWN and humans to\nagain coexist have all left.

Darach: Your mastery of Pokémon is as\nbreathtaking as ever.\c[VAR 0103(0000,0000)], you certainly are to be\ncommended.\c...However, if I may say so, I noticed\nsomething about the way you battle.\cAfter all, I have had the opportunity\nto watch you closely firsthand.\cSo, what is it that I noticed?\cAs a Trainer myself, it is but proper\netiquette to show you in a battle.\cLet us begin!\nEn garde!\c
Darach: [VAR 0103(0000,0000)], you are truly in\npossession of a superlative talent!\cI drew on every reserve of experience\nand etiquette handed down through\rour heritage of glorious servitude.\cBut even then, I failed to fend off your\ninspired and inspiring challenge.\cI shall see to appeasing Lady Caitlin's\ndispleasure at my loss.\c[VAR 0103(0000,0000)], please do return to our\nBattle Castle.\cWe will be delighted and feel privileged\nto have you back!\c

VOLTORB Flip is a game in which you flip\nover cards to find numbers hidden\rbeneath them.\cThe cards are hiding the numbers\n1 through 3...and VOLTORB as well.\cThe first number you flip over will give\nyou that many Coins.\cFrom then on, the next number you\nfind will multiply the total amount of\rCoins you've collected by that number.\cIf it's a 2, your total will be multiplied\nby “x2.”\cIf it's a 3, your total will be multiplied\nby “x3.”\cBut if you flip over a VOLTORB, it's\ngame over.\cWhen that happens, you'll lose all the\nCoins you've collected in the\rcurrent game.\cIf you select “Quit,” you'll withdraw\nfrom the game.\cIf you get to a difficult spot, you might\nwant to end the game early.\cOnce you've found all the hidden\n2 and 3 cards, you've cleared\rthe game.\cOnce you've flipped over all these\ncards, then you'll advance to the\rnext level.\cAs you move up in levels, you will be\nable to receive more Coins.\rDo your best!\c
The numbers at the side of the board\ngive you a clue about the numbers\rhidden on the backs of the panels.\cThe larger the number, the more likely\nit is that there are many large numbers\rhidden in that row or column.\cIn the same way, you can tell how many\nVOLTORB are hidden in the row\ror column.\cConsider the hidden number totals and\nthe VOLTORB totals carefully as you flip\rover panels.\c
Select “Open Memo” to mark\nthe cards.\cYou can mark the cards with the\nnumbers 1 through 3, but also with a\rVOLTORB mark.\cWhen you have an idea of the numbers\nhidden on the back of the cards, touch\c“Open Memo” and select the cards\nto mark.\cIf you want to remove a mark, touch the\nmark again, and it will disappear.\c
Will this be the last card?!
Is this what you're expecting?!

So good of you to come here!\cSprout Tower is a place of training.\nPeople and Pokémon test their bonds\rto build a bright future together.\rI am the final test.\cAllow me to check the ties between\nyou and your Pokémon!\c
Hmmm...\nThe way you battle is quite elegant.\cYou should be able to stand up\nto Falkner.\cAnd you should be able to make good use\nof this...\cIt is a Technical Machine called Flash.\nTake it with you!\c
When a Pokémon learns Flash, you can\nilluminate caves no matter how dark\rthey may be.\cYou can try it on BELLSPROUT,\nfor example...
I hope you learn and grow from\nyour journey.

So many people have gone up\nthe tower with a Rainbow Wing\rto try and bring back HO-OH.\cBut none succeeded in making\nHO-OH appear...\cThe Rainbow Wing is merely to permit you\nto go up this tower.\cWhat HO-OH has longed for is the\ninvisible trust between people and\rPokémon...\cOr the person who can restore such\na relationship...\c
A long time ago, there used to be a\nPokémon at the top of this tower,\rnamely HO-OH.\cBut it flew away, and no one has seen it\nsince...\cIf anyone who could restore deep trust\nbetween people and Pokémon were to\rcome here with something linked to\rHO-OH... It may come down for such\ra person...\c
That thing you have...!\c
You have done it...\nPlease come through.
That Rainbow Wing will merely permit you\nto go up the tower.\cIf you are not the kind of person who\nwould restore the trust between people\rand Pokémon, HO-OH will never show\ritself to you...
Hmmm.\cSo it was you and the Bell!
You are quite a remarkable Trainer\nfor your age...

This is all we can do for you...\nWhat you do now is entirely up to you...
That IS indeed HO-OH...\nThe guardian of the sky around here\rfrom ancient times...\cSo many have tried and tried, only\nto fail...\c[VAR 0103(0000,0000)], your heart and the Clear\nBell in harmony have finally made\rit appear...\c
[VAR 0103(0000,0000)], don't you see?\cHO-OH must have been waiting for\nsomeone like you all this time.\rWouldn't you agree...?\c
HO-OH: Shaoooh!\c
You have done a great job.\nSay hello to Professor Elm for us.
You have not only made HO-OH appear,\nbut you have also caught it...\cYou are so wonderful.\nThere is nothing more for us to say.\cTake good care of yourself in\nyour journey...
If that is what you believe, we will not\ntry to convince you otherwise.\cStill, if you want to see HO-OH once\nmore, perhaps you can come back here\rafter everything has been settled...

My staff here at the Ruins Research\nCenter is excellent, and the research\rmakes good progress with absolutely\rno effort on my part.\cIf you have any questions, feel free to\ntalk to my staff!
I managed to unravel quite a lot of the\nmystery of UNOWN with your help!\cThank you, thank you.\nThank you, again!
The ruins are about 1,500 years old.\nThat's all we know about them.\cBut it's not known why they were\nbuilt...or by whom.
Wow, did you catch an UNOWN?\nThat's wonderful!\cCome to think of it... How come we've\nsuddenly started to see UNOWN?
You have to hear this!\nThis is a big discovery!\cIt was you who solved the stone-panel\npuzzle that allowed UNOWN to appear.\cThose tablets are the key to waking\nup UNOWN!\cStill... Why would anyone make such\na key?\c
You have to hear this!\nThis is a big discovery!\cIf you turn on the radio in the ruins,\nyou can receive mysterious radio waves!\cIt's proof that UNOWN communicate\nwith each other using radio waves!\c
You have to hear this!\nThis is a big discovery!\cThere are as many UNOWN as there are\nletters in the alphabet!\cThere have been 26 types confirmed.\nWhy don't you collect them all?\c
How do you like the UNOWN Report\nI gave you?\cUNOWN are recorded as you catch them.\nIt is quite useful!
You have to hear this!\nThis is a big discovery!\cWe have figured out that UNOWN are in a\ncertain order!\rLet me see your report.\c
There!\nI put the UNOWN in the correct order!\rWe may be able to tell more about them.\c
What?\nYou found a room with UNOWN symbols?\rThat is a big discovery!\cWe will study them right away.\c
You have to hear this!\nThis is a big discovery!\cWe have found two new UNOWN symbols!\cIt means that...\nThere must be two more kinds of UNOWN\rsomewhere...\c
You have to hear this!\nWe are learning more and more about the\rsymbols on the floor!\c...It seems that UNOWN were living at\nthe ruins with a human clan.\cIt is thought that this clan made the\nPokémon statues underground.\cThe UNOWN were easily scared and\nwouldn't go outside.\cWhen more and more people started to\nappear around the ruins, the clan that\rwished to live in harmony with the UNOWN\reventually left...\cThanks to our research and your\nhelp, we have unraveled so much about\rtheir mystery!\cWe have so many things we don't know\nleft, of course.\cArchaeology never ends.\c
I will let you know if I find out\nanything else.

We look forward to your next visit.\c
You can call me the Judge.\cHeheh, it's actually not my real name,\nbut that's what everyone calls me.\cIt's because of this weird power I\nhave. It's a gift, really.\cI can discern--judge you can say--the\noverall potential of individual Pokémon.\cIf you'd like, I could judge the\nintriguing potential of your Pokémon.\c
If you'd like, I could judge the\nintriguing potential of your Pokémon.\c
...Oh.\nYou don't need me to judge. I get it.
Judge an Egg?!\nThat's a tall order even for me.\c
I see, I see...\cThis Pokémon's potential is decent all\naround.\cThat's my determination, and it's final.\c
I see, I see...\cThis Pokémon's potential is above\naverage overall.\cThat's my determination, and it's final.\c
I see, I see...\cThis Pokémon has relatively superior\npotential overall.\cThat's my determination, and it's final.\c
I see, I see...\cThis Pokémon has outstanding potential\noverall.\cThat's my determination, and it's final.\c
Incidentally, I would say the best\npotential lies in its HP.\c
Incidentally, I would say the best\npotential lies in its Attack stat.\c
Incidentally, I would say the best\npotential lies in its Defense stat.\c
Incidentally, I would say the best\npotential lies in its Sp. Atk stat.\c
Incidentally, I would say the best\npotential lies in its Sp. Def stat.\c
Incidentally, I would say the best\npotential lies in its Speed stat.\c
It's rather decent in that regard.\nThat's how I judged it.
It's very good in that regard.\nThat's how I judged it.
It's fantastic in that regard.\nThat's how I judged it.
It can't be better in that regard.\nThat's how I judged it.
A Ribbon will be awarded to the\nparticipating Pokémon!

Battle Tower... It's so tall!\nI wonder how many times my height it is?
All the places in the Battle Frontier\nlet you team up with a friend!\rThat's so cool, don't you think?\rI wish I had a friend to team up with...
I am the super Idol in Johto!\cI've come all the way to the\nBattle Frontier to promote my\rlatest song!\cBut...\cEverybody seems to be a\nPoké Maniac here!
Fishing won't keep me calm since I came\nto know about the Battle Frontier.\rWhen I go fishing, I find myself quitting\rearly and coming here.
The place I like best among the five\nfacilities here would be the\rBattle Castle, because you can see\rLady Caitlin there!
What makes me the most happy being\na Trainer?\cThe fact that Pokémon will always bring\nme lots of friends!
Just like people go through different\nthings they can learn from, Pokémon\rlearn different things from battles.\cBehind every experience, there is a\nstory. Isn't that right, dear?
All experiences lead to a tale.\nI'm not wrong, am I, dear?
I've come to the Battle Frontier to\nget a job!\cThanks to my previous job, I'm good\nat cooking, cleaning, and laundry!
To be strong is to be weak.\nTo be weak is to be strong.\cSomebody told me that before.\nI don't quite understand it yet,\rbut it sounds deep.\cI'll just give myself some time\nto figure it out.
Watching these people who care so much\nabout Pokémon makes me feel ashamed\rof my selfishness.\cI'll try and face my Pokémon for real!
I wonder how many years it's been since\nI first met a Pokémon? ...Forty-nine!\cOh, I lost the page that kept track of\nhow many years, days, and hours...\cCould it be my Pokémon nibbling on it?
Trainers care about Pokémon\nas the battle progresses.\cIn return, Pokémon repay that trust\nby using moves the best they can.\cWhat you see in a battle is the trust\nbetween people and Pokémon.\cThis may seem obvious, but it's actually\nincredibly amazing!
You cannot try anything if you are\nafraid of losing battles.\cBut!\cGetting into a battle knowing you have\nno chance of winning will only make your\rPokémon suffer.\cThat's not courage!\nTruly good Trainers know the balance\rbetween courage and cautiousness.
If you want to graduate from being\na so-so Trainer, mark my words!\cThe Pokémon's type!\cThe moves to be learned!\cThe items to be held!\cYou can't overlook a single detail.
When people win a battle, some laugh\nat their opponent.\cSome brag about his or her strengths.\cSome even start to dance around \nclaiming he or she is number one\rin the world.\cI respect people who win and then\ncare about their opponent.
Have you heard of the Brains of the\nBattle Frontier?\cThere are five facilities in the\nBattle Frontier.\cAt every one, you can win your way\nthrough to challenge the bosses\rcalled the Frontier Brains.\rThey're out-of-this-world tough!
Allowing us to enjoy battles,\nhelping us work,\rtaking us to places far away,\ror just being good friends...\cPokémon are so deep.\nI wanna be like Pokémon.
At the Battle Factory, you have to\nkeep winning with rental Pokémon.\cI may not stand a chance at other\nfacilities, but I may go all the\rway here!
The Battle Hall is where Pokémon battle\none-on-one for as long as they can.\cEven my MAGIKARP has a shot at\nnumber one!\cWow!\cJust the thought of it makes\nme excited!
Life is full of ebbs and flows.\nI'll keep my inflatable tube close.\cI could call it the wisdom I gained\nin the last five years of my life.

Welcome to the Battle Frontier!\cThis is your first visit?\nRight this way, please!\c
Oh! You have a Vs. Recorder!\nHow nice!\cWe upgrade Vs. Recorders for first-time\nvisitors for Battle Frontier use.\cI'll borrow yours for a moment.\cLet's see... Slide open this part here,\nand ticka-tacka-kachunk there!\cAll done!\nHere you go.\c
[VAR 0103(0000,0000)]'s Vs. Recorder was\nupgraded.
Our other staff will be pleased to\nexplain how the individual facilities\rof the Battle Frontier operate.\cI can go over general topics.\nDo you have any questions? [VAR 0200(0000)]
Which topic should I explain? [VAR 0200(0000)]
The Battle Frontier has five facilities\ndedicated to battling.\cAt the Battle Tower, the objective is\nto beat seven Trainers in a row.\cAt the Battle Hall, you may keep battle\nrecords of individual Pokémon.\cAt the Battle Factory, you must win\nconsecutive battles with rentals.\cThe Battle Castle forces Trainers to\nmanage Castle Points to advance.\cAnd finally, the Battle Arcade is where\nrandom luck triggers events.\cYou can try any of these facilities!\c
The battles at the five Battle Frontier\nfacilities are held under special rules.\cFirst and foremost, no Exp. Points\ncan be earned.\cConsequently, the Pokémon battling\nhere will not level up.\cIf the Level 50 rule is chosen,\nPokémon of higher levels will be\rtemporarily reduced to Lv. 50.\cPokémon under Lv. 50 will be entered\nwithout an upward level adjustment.\c
Battle Points are usually referred to\nas BP.\cBP are points that are used only in\nthe Battle Frontier.\cBP are awarded for meeting certain\nperformance goals at the various\rBattle Frontier facilities.\cBP can be exchanged for prizes at\nthe Exchange Service Corner.\c
The Exchange Service Corner is\ncomprised of two tents straight\rahead past here.\cThere, you may exchange your BP for\na wide variety of prizes.\cPlease do visit it!\c
The Performance Monitor shows Trainer\ndata, such as the previous record and\rthe best record to date.\cYou will find one near the reception\ncounter in each facility.\c
We hope you enjoy your visit!
           
         
            
          
   
           
Welcome to the Battle Frontier!\cShould I explain how the\nBattle Tower works? [VAR 0200(0000)]
The Battle Tower is the building at the\nback of the Battle Frontier.\cThe object here is to enter a team of\ndifferent Pokémon and battle on until\ryou lose.\c
We hope you enjoy your visit!
Welcome to the Battle Frontier!\cShould I explain how the\nBattle Factory works? [VAR 0200(0000)]
The Battle Factory is at the upper-\nright corner of the Battle Frontier.\cThere, you engage in a knockout\ntournament with rented Pokémon.\cThe goal is to keep winning for\nas long as possible.\cEvery time you win a match, you may\ntrade one of your Pokémon for one of\rthe opponent's Pokémon.\c
We hope you enjoy your visit!
Welcome to the Battle Frontier!\cShould I explain how the\nBattle Hall works? [VAR 0200(0000)]
The Battle Hall is at the upper-left\ncorner of the Battle Frontier.\cHere, you enter one Pokémon of your\nchoosing for one-on-one battles.\cThe objective is to keep your winning\nstreak going as long as possible.\c
We hope you enjoy your visit!
Welcome to the Battle Frontier!\cShould I explain how the\nBattle Castle works? [VAR 0200(0000)]
The Battle Castle is at the lower-left\ncorner of the Battle Frontier.\cHere, you are provided with Castle\nPoints, CP, that you must manage.\cThe CP are used for healing Pokémon,\nrenting items or Berries, and so on.\cThe objective is to keep a winning\nstreak alive while managing your CP.\c
We hope you enjoy your visit!
Welcome to the Battle Frontier!\cShould I explain how the\nBattle Arcade works? [VAR 0200(0000)]
The Battle Arcade is at the lower-right\ncorner of the Battle Frontier.\cHere, a game board is activated\nbefore every match.\cDepending on what comes up on the\ngame board, an event takes place.\cSome events will be good to the\nchallenger, while others won't be.\cThe challenger may even avoid having\nto battle at all.\cThe objective is to keep a winning\nstreak alive as long as possible.\c
We hope you enjoy your visit!
The Battle Frontier is up ahead!\nI have explored places all over the\rworld, but nothing compares to the\rexcitement I feel right now!\cWhat kinds of Trainers will I see?\nWhat battles will I experience?\cIt's a whole new adventure for me!
The five facilities of the Battle\nFrontier are...\cTower.\cHall.\cCastle.\cFactory.\cAnd Arcade.\cHow do you make an acronym out of\nthat? THCFA?\cRearrange those letters, maybe?\nFATCH! CHAFT!\c...Nope! Nothing works!\nDidn't anyone think of this?!
The Vs. Recorder is sure nifty!\cChecking the Frontier Record\nwill tell you how much BP you have.
My dream is to battle Palmer of the\nBattle Tower.\cI want to record it for posterity on\nmy Vs. Recorder.\cBut I left my Vs. Recorder\nat home... I'm heartbroken!

Click, click, click...\nOh! It is you!\cI've gotten over being first all\nthe time.\cNow I'm counting the number of people\ncoming to the Battle Frontier.\rOf course no one asked me to.\rIt's just a hobby.
I can't stop shivering!\cI told my family that I would conquer\nthe Battle Frontier when I left home...\cBut now I'm here, and somehow I\ncan't stop shivering!\cWhat am I gonna do if I get beaten\nto a pulp?\c
...You look quite young.\c...\n...\cI will pull myself together and\nchallenge the Battle Frontier...\rMaybe!\c
I will pull myself together and\nchallenge the Battle Frontier!\c...\nOr I might not!\c
Finally!\nI'm here at the Battle Frontier!\cWhen a Pokémon battle on the road\ndoesn't satisfy you any longer, you\rhave to come to the Battle Frontier!\cWouldn't you agree?
Normally, choosing which Pokémon is all\nthere is to a Pokémon battle.\cBut when you change certain rules or\nlimitations, the battle suddenly\rbecomes even more fun.\cAnd this place you can have such fun...\nis called the Battle Frontier!
This Is the Battle Frontier\cCome, Proud Trainers\nAim for the Top!

The Battle Hall Multi Battle challenge\nrequires both partners to enter the\rsame kind of Pokémon.\cPlease confer with your friend and\nchoose the same kind of Pokémon.\c
CHALLENGE
Do you eat your favorite dish first or\nleave it for later?\cAt the Battle Hall, it's better to start\nwith the types that your Pokémon\rdo not like. Why?\cBecause the opposition goes up in\nlevel as you progress!
That opulent stage!\cYour streaks of winnings are kept per\neach kind of Pokémon.\rEvery Pokémon can get up there.\cDon't you think it's wonderful\nyou can aim for the top with\rany Pokémon?
Slow...\cMy SLOWBRO is a cutie, but he's even\nbattled the Brain here.\cThe Brain will take your Pokémon on at\nthe same level, to be fair.
SLOWBRO: ...Slow?
Here is a tip!\cYou should try the Battle Hall with\nnot just your favorite Pokémon,\cbut different kinds of Pokémon\nif you want to build your\roverall record as well.
At the Battle Hall, if it's the same kind\nof Pokémon, you can enter different\rones and still keep your record.\cYou may want to have different ones\nknowing different types of moves.
You know how HOPPIP has two types--\nGrass and Flying?\cThat means it can appear as a\nGrass type and as a Flying type.\cMe?\cYou could think of me as...\na “Lighthearted” type and\ra “Beautiful” type, I guess.
A piece of advice...\cAt the Battle Hall, the opposing\nPokémon are matched in level to yours.\cThat way, you can choose any of your\nPokémon without worrying about\rtheir levels.
The Battle Hall lets you keep the\nwinning-streak records.\rThat's neat, huh?\c...Wait a sec!\cMy friend and I can start challenges\nwith identical conditions and see who\rcan stretch their win streak\rthe longest.\rThat's even more fun!
I keep track of the total number of\nwins from your longest Single Battle\rwin streaks at the Battle Hall.\cTo explain, I add only the longest win\nstreaks of each kind of Pokémon.
When your total win-streak record hits\ncertain figures, you will earn BP as\ra reward.\c[VAR 0103(0000,0000)], your total win-streak\nrecord is presently [VAR 0137(0001,0000)].\c
Your total win-streak record has\nreached [VAR 0137(0002,0000)].\rHere is your BP reward.\c
When your total win-streak record\nreaches [VAR 0137(0003,0000)], you will earn BP.
[VAR 0103(0000,0000)] received [VAR 0135(0004,0000)] BP!
[VAR 0103(0000,0000)], your total win-streak\nrecord stands at [VAR 0137(0001,0000)].\c
[VAR 0103(0000,0000)], your total win-streak\nrecord stands at [VAR 0137(0001,0000)].\c...My goodness!\nThat's a fantastic record!
Winston: The Battle Hall's been kind of\nboring lately.\cThere haven't been any dazzling\nchallengers who can electrify crowds.\cThe kind of challenger who can beat the\nBrain... Aren't there any around?
Winston: Let me take a wild guess.\nAre you getting into the Battle Hall?\rIt's addictively fun, huh?\cThe more you win, the more kinds of\nPokémon you get to see, too.
Winston: ...\n...Oh, sorry for staring!\cI saw you on stage the last time.\nYou've got some star quality.\cI think I'm going to keep an eye on you.\nThere's real charisma there.
Winston: I check you out every time\nyou get up on stage.\cYou're fun to watch, let me tell you.\cNow I'm always looking forward to\nseeing the combo of you and your\rPokémon on stage.
Winston: Hey, there!\nWhat are you going to do this time?\cWhich Pokémon are you going for a\nrecord with next?\cWhen I get to thinking about that,\nI get too wound up to sleep at night.\cThat's why I've been sleeping in lately!
Winston: Awesome!\nSeriously awesome!\rYou're beyond awesome, even!\cThe love you show so many Pokémon...\nIt's no easy feat, I can tell ya!
Winston: I've never seen Pokémon\nbattle as enjoyably as yours do.\cYou're the first of a kind for me as\nTrainers go.\cYou know, I brag about you to everyone\nwho's willing to listen.\cI was saying that you're going to be a\nstar before you even got a record!
Winston: Go, [VAR 0103(0000,0000)], go!\nGo, [VAR 0103(0000,0000)], go!\cI'm thinking up some dance steps and\ncheers I can do to support you.\cIf you want to see them, you'll need to\nkeep working on your records!
Winston: You're phenomenal.\nAll the battles you waged on stage...\rAll those moments of glory...\cYour star burns so bright and huge!\nI can barely open my eyes around you!
Winston: The love for Pokémon you\nexhibited at the Battle Hall is as\rinfinitely deep as it is wide...\cYou can count on me, Winston, to be\nyour lifelong fan.\cJust as you love Pokémon, I love you\nas the Pokémon superstar!
Serena: It's about the Battle Hall...\nIt hasn't excited me lately.\cThere's been no gorgeous sort of\nchallenger who can dazzle me.\cThe kind of challenger who can make me\na fan... Aren't there any around?
Serena: Um... Excuse me?\cIf you don't mind me asking, are you\ngetting into the Battle Hall?\cIt's fun in an engrossing way, isn't it?\nDid you know?\cThe more you win, the more kinds of\nPokémon appear.
Serena: Um... Excuse me?\cI watched you when you were on stage.\nIt made me feel all tingly seeing you.\cUm... You won't mind if I cheer for you\nfrom now on, will you? Please, may I?
Serena: Um... Excuse me?\cI cheer for you the best I can.\cI can't get up on stage with you, but\nI want to lend my support to your\rPokémon and you for trying so hard.
Serena: Um... Excuse me?\cCan you tell me what kind of Pokémon\nyou're going for a record with next?\cWhen I start thinking about that, I get\nsort of all choked up.\cI have trouble sleeping at night when\nI get that way.
Serena: Um... Excuse me?\cFantastic! It's fantastic!\nYou're fabulously fantastic!\cThe love you show so many Pokémon...\nIt must take extraordinary effort.
Serena: I've never seen Pokémon\nbattle as enjoyably as yours do.\cYou're the first Trainer ever who's\ndone that.\cI... I brag about you to all my friends.\nI hope you don't mind.\cI tell them I wish I could be as\nwonderful a Trainer as you!
Serena: Hurray, hurray, [VAR 0103(0000,0000)]!\nGo, Pokémon, go!\c...Oh! Um... Excuse me.\cI was working on cheers and a dance\nroutine for you.\cB-but, I'm sorry for being so silly and\ngiddy and...
Serena: You're so inspiring to me.\cAll the glory you earned while battling\nso often on that shining stage...\cJust seeing you makes me feel all\nhappy inside. ♪
Serena: Your Pokémon love that you've\nshown at the Battle Hall is as infinitely\rdeep as it is wide...\cIt's amazing, but you love every kind of\nPokémon there is.\cI love you for being so amazing and\ndedicated!
Lyra: Hi, [VAR 0103(0000,0000)].\nI love watching you battle here.\cCause...\nyou have fun whether you win\ror lose!
Ethan: The Battle Hall is great for\nPokémon fans like me!\cI get to see so many new kinds of\nPokémon I've never seen.\cIt's so cool!
Mom: [VAR 0103(0000,0000)]!\cI couldn't help checking up on you!\cEveryone is working hard, but I have\nto say you look more delighted than\ranyone else!\cOh, [VAR 0103(0000,0000)], that's right!\cI should go to the Department Store\nin Goldenrod and buy some useful\ritems for you on the way home!
Professor Oak: You keep amazing me\nover and over again.\cWhat a Trainer you turned out to be!\cIt's not enough that you caught\nPokémon in numbers beyond belief.\cThat alone is fantastic enough.\nBut you've bonded and battled with\rthem as well.\cI am so proud to know you!
Whitney: I love showy events like\nthe Battle Hall.\cI'm not saying that I want to stand out\nin the crowd...\cI just love seeing cute Pokémon\ngetting lots of attention!

One Trainer should select\n“BECOME LEADER.”\cThe other Trainer must select\n“JOIN GROUP.” [VAR 0200(0000)]
We need to launch DS Wireless\nCommunications. [VAR 0200(0000)]
You must save the game before\nI show you in. Please wait.
Listen carefully!\cIf your Pokémon win without taking\ndamage, you earn more CP.\rThe more, the merrier!\rLook at me. I don't have much...
Listen!\cYou can earn more Castle Points or CP\nby facing higher-level opponents.\cThis is what they call high risk,\nhigh return!
Before every battle, you should check\nthe opponent's lineup.\cDon't be cheap with your CP.\nIt's like that old saying goes about\rknowing your enemy.\c“Unless you enter the enemy's lair,\nyou cannot take their prize.”\c...\rThat's not the right old saying!
Mr. Darach...\cHis feelings for Lady Caitlin are\nall bottled up...\cOh, how I pine for him...
At first, you can only use CP for\nrestoring HP.\cBut you can spend CP to rank up.\nThen, you can even restore PP!
If you lose, your entire stock of CP\nis cleaned out to zero!\cThis is the rule at the Battle Castle.
My dream is to wear a beautiful dress\nand live in a castle!\cThat's not what I meant to say...\cMy dream is to live in a castle with\nsomeone who wears a beautiful dress!

The game board is like your life.\cIt goes round and round\nas your fortune goes up and down...\rHow did that sound?\cIt almost made some kind of sense,\ndidn't it?
There's an aspect of luck in\nPokémon battles...\cThe Battle Arcade reminds me of that,\ndecisively. Very decisively...
What quality is most needed here?\nIs it strength?\rWisdom?\rLuck?\rNo. The answer is...flexibility.\rThat's what my gut tells me.
Do you know what I mean by\n“stop on the spot”?\cIt's the skill of stopping the\ngame board at the right time!\cBut, remember...\rIf you don't stop it in 30 seconds,\nit will stop by itself.
I thought I was fully prepared with my\nprized Pokémon, but I had to swap them\rand use my opponent's instead!\rI need to rethink all my strategies.
I chose Pokémon that are good at\nattacking.\rBut my opponent went for speed!\cNext time, I'll try Pokémon with\nsuperior speed.
There are advantages to be gained from\n“stop on the spot” skills!\cBut there's a lot of fun in letting the\nunknown hand of luck decide...
The game board shows better choices\nthe greater the wins you achieve...\cCould this board be alive...?
Did you figure this one out?\cParalyzing events here won't\naffect Ground-type Pokémon.\cYou should tell everybody!
I'll tell you something.\cPoisoning or freezing events can be\nmade ineffective.\c...If the Pokémon's type or ability\nprotects it from such status problems.\cMight be worth knowing!

Hm... Good to see you here.\rNo need to explain why you came.\cClair sent you here, didn't she?\rThat girl is a handful...\cI am sorry, but I must test you.\cNot to worry, you are to answer only\na few questions.\rReady?\c
What are Pokémon to you? [VAR 0200(0000)]
What helps you to win battles? [VAR 0200(0000)]
What kind of Trainer do you\nwish to battle? [VAR 0200(0000)]
What is most important for\nraising Pokémon? [VAR 0200(0000)]
Strong Pokémon. Weak Pokémon.\nWhich is more important? [VAR 0200(0000)]
Hm... I see...\nYou care deeply for Pokémon.\cVery commendable.\rThat conviction is what is important!\c[VAR 0103(0000,0000)], don't lose that belief.\cIt will see you through at the\nPokémon League.\c
Hah? I didn't quite catch that...\c
What was it you said?
Oh, I understand...\c
So how did it go?\cI guess there's no point in asking.\nYou did fail?\r...\r...What? You passed?\c
[VAR FF01(00C8)]That can't be![VAR FF01(0064)]\c
You're lying!\nEven I haven't been approved!\c
Clair!\cThis child is impeccable,\nin skill and spirit!\cAdmit defeat and confer the\nRising Badge!\c...Or must I inform Lance of this?\c
I... I understand...\c
Here, this is the Rising Badge...\nHurry up! Take it!\c
[VAR 0103(0000,0000)] received\nthe Rising Badge from Clair!
The Rising Badge will enable your\nPokémon to use the move for\rclimbing waterfalls.\cAlso, all Pokémon will know you as\na Trainer and obey your every\rcommand without question.\c
Clair...\cReflect upon what it is that you\nlack and this child has.\c
...\n...\c
By the way...\nHave you heard of LUGIA?\cIt is a Pokémon said to have lived\naround Whirl Islands once...\r...Never mind.\cJust mad words of the old.\n
By the way...\nHave you heard of LUGIA?\rEr...\cBetween Olivine and Cianwood are\nislands called Whirl Islands.\cThere is a huge waterfall deep in the\ncave there. It is said that LUGIA\crests in the deep end of the\nwaterfall basin...\cYou need a Silver Wing to reach the\nwaterfall basin, I've heard...

It's been quite some time since a\nTrainer has gained our Master's\rrare approval.\cIn fact, not since Master Lance.
You know young Master Lance?\cHe looks so much like our Master\ndid in his youth.\rIt's in their blood.
Hm... Good to see you here.\cYour arrival is most fortunate.\nI have something for you.\cTake this DRATINI as proof that I\nnow know your worth.\c

Hm? Your party is full.
Dragon Pokémon are symbolic of\nour clan.\cYou have shown that you can be\nentrusted with one.
Clair appears to have learned an\ninvaluable lesson from you.\cI thank you as her grandfather.

Hi! Is it your first time here at\nthe Safari Zone? [VAR 0200(0000)]
Welcome, Owner!\nShould I explain the Safari Zone? [VAR 0200(0000)]
At the Safari Zone, you can enjoy a\nSafari Game where you are given [VAR 0133(0001,0000)]\rSafari Balls to try to catch Pokémon.\cWhen you have run out of Safari Balls,\nthe game is over.\cWhen you see a Pokémon, you can choose\nto throw Bait or Mud.\cIf you throw Bait, Pokémon tend to stay\nbut will become more difficult to catch.\cIf you throw Mud, it will become easier\nto catch, but the Pokémon may flee.\cHave fun at the Safari Zone!
Have fun at the Safari Zone!
Warden Baoba has something important\nto share with you!
This is the Area Customizer.\nWhat would you like to know about? [VAR 0200(0000)]
The Safari Zone has six Areas.\cPlains Area...\nPeak Area...\rand so on.\cThe Area Customizer allows you to\nchange the combination of these Areas.\cWhat would you like to know? [VAR 0200(0000)]
Check out the machine, and you'll see\nthe Area Customizer screen.\cThe lower window shows the current\nSafari Zone setting.\cSelect an Area with the A Button to\nswap it with another.\cWhat would you like to know? [VAR 0200(0000)]
When you select an Area, then select\nSwap, you will see 12 new Areas.\cSelect one of them by highlighting it and\npressing the A Button.\cWhat would you like to know? [VAR 0200(0000)]
When you select an Area, then select\nOrder, the Area type will not change,\rbut the location can now be changed.\cWhat would you like to know? [VAR 0200(0000)]
Different Areas have different Pokémon\nliving in them, so when you change\rAreas, you will see different Pokémon.\cPlease do try the different Areas!\nWhat would you like to know? [VAR 0200(0000)]
I am sorry, but this can't be used yet.\nWarden Baoba has a great plan for this\rmachine...or so he says. But even we\rdon't know what it is. It's a secret.
Please enjoy the Area Customizer!
[VAR 0103(0000,0000)] turned on\nthe Area Customizer!\c
It is still under development.
Hi, I have been waiting for you!\nWhat do you think?\cThis is a brand-new Safari Zone.\nBy the way...\cI just had an idea.\nWould you like to take the Owner\rAptitude Test? [VAR 0200(0000)]
Right on!\nLet me explain how the test works.\rIt's very easy.\cAll you have to do is to catch one\nGEODUDE at the Safari and show it to me.\cThey are in the grass closest to the\nentrance. It shouldn't take long\rbefore you catch one.\cGood luck!
Wow, I never thought anyone\nwould decline!\cYou can become the Safari Zone Owner,\ndon't you see?\cOwner...\nIt's got a nice ring to it, doesn't it?\cYou should try the test! [VAR 0200(0000)]
Oh, wonderful!\nYou've caught a GEODUDE!\rYou've passed the first test.\c..................\cHuh? Didn't I tell you that there are\ntwo tests?\cThat's right!\nBecoming an owner is not that easy.\cThe second test is...\nWell, I am still preparing for it.\cI will let you know once it's ready.\nYou need to wait just a little.\rI will call you with the Pokégear.
Show me the GEODUDE once you've\ncaught one.\cThey are in the grass closest to the\nentrance. It shouldn't take long.\cGood luck!
I've been waiting for you!\nThe test is ready.\cThis time can you catch a SANDSHREW\nand show it to me?\cSounds easy, right? Not really!\nSANDSHREW will not appear with the\rcurrent Safari Zone setting.\cAnd that's where this comes in handy!\c
This sophisticated, high-tech machine\nlets you customize Safari Zone Areas.\rI call it the Area Customizer!\cYou want to know how it works,\ndon't you?\rIt's a...secret!\cWell, you shouldn't have trouble\noperating it. Just talk to the staff\rnext to me!\c
I almost forgot!\cI was in the middle of explaining\nthe second test, wasn't I?\cYou will not see SANDSHREW\nwith the current Safari Zone Areas,\cso you have to use the Area Customizer\nto change them.\cSANDSHREW live in the desert!\nGood luck!
You did it!\cYou caught a SANDSHREW!\nI knew you could do it.\cYou've passed the test!\nYou are now the Safari Zone Owner!\c
I've always wanted to see young people\nplaying at the safari!\cI thought I might get some new ideas.\nThat should help you complete your\rPokédex.\cThat's what I have been thinking.\c
By the way, though you are now the\nSafari Zone Owner, would you kindly\rcontinue to pay admission?\rWe have our reasons.\cDon't be upset. I'll keep thinking about\nhow I can create new fun ways to\rhelp you complete your Pokédex.\cGo have fun at the Safari Zone!
I will let you know as soon as I come up\nwith something new, using the Pokégear!
Show me the SANDSHREW once you've\ncaught one. SANDSHREW live in the\rdesert! Good luck!
Slow down.\cOnce the next test is ready, I will call\nyou using the Pokégear.\cGive me some time, OK?
Hi, I have been waiting for you!\cI had an epiphany!\nA new attraction!\cI've decided to call it...\nObject Arrangement!\cThis is going to be fun!\nYou can place objects on the field as\ryou play at the Safari Zone!\c
Not only that, but the types of\nPokémon you see will change depending\ron the types of objects you place.\cIsn't it amazing?\nI will call you using the Pokégear if\rsomething else comes up!\c
I will explain Object Arrangement.\nWould you like to know anything? [VAR 0200(0000)]
I will explain Object Arrangement.\nFeel free to ask me any questions.\c
There are many objects you can place\nanywhere as you walk around the Safari\rZone, except on stairs and grass where\rPokémon appear!\cYou also want to remember that you can\nplace up to 30 objects in an Area.\cWould you like to know anything\nelse? [VAR 0200(0000)]
It is easy to place objects. All you\nhave to do is make sure that the spot\rin front of you is clear.\cIf it's empty, you can select\nan object.\cSome objects are large and may need a\nlarge space.\cWould you like to know anything\nelse? [VAR 0200(0000)]
If you want to remove an object, just\nwalk up to it and check it. The objects\ryou have placed will glow in the dark.\rIt should help you at night.\cWould you like to know anything\nelse? [VAR 0200(0000)]
There are many different objects.\nOnes that look like grass, like trees,\rlike boulders, like water, and other\rtypes of objects...\cTry placing different objects. The\nnumber of objects placed in an Area\ris shown in the Area Customizer\ron the top screen.\cThere will be more objects to come,\nas I'll keep adding more.\cWould you like to know anything\nelse? [VAR 0200(0000)]
The types of Pokémon you see will\nchange depending on the types\rof objects you place.\cThe Safari Zone is also changed\nat that point. Try placing different\rtypes of objects.\cWould you like to know anything\nelse? [VAR 0200(0000)]
Beware!\cOnce you've swapped Areas, the\nobjects you placed will all be removed.\cWould you like to know\nanything else? [VAR 0200(0000)]

Y-y-you're Pokéathlete [VAR 0103(0000,0000)]!\cI have no clue how I could possibly\nreach where you are!\rYou are the Pokéathlon itself!
Wow!\nThat guy over there is Magnus,\rthe Pokéathlon owner!\cI heard he once beat a MACHAMP at\narm wrestling. Could it be true?

My boyfriend's a Pokéathlete.\cBut he's so shy about it that I root\nfor him behind a column so he won't\rspot me!
Don't you think he's so cool dripping\nsweat just like his Pokémon?\cNot that he even compares to the great\nPokéathlete [VAR 0103(0000,0000)], though.
Participate in the Pokéathlon to\nreduce stress.\rThat's the way to go!
Don't you dare underestimate your mom.\nThe look on her face when she was\rselling things at a bargain...\cIt still gives me shivers!\c
Every father longs to be a hero to\ntheir son.\cThe Pokéathlon...\nDo I want to take it up?\cJust you wait and see, Son!
Ahh... My son!\nI'm so sad to hear that.\cLet me hear you say you want to be\nlike your dad...\c
My mom will finally participate.\cI was starting to worry because she\nnever exercises.\c
I'll grow up to be a great\nPokéathlete like you, [VAR 0103(0000,0000)]!\c
I'm cheering for you!
Are you Pokéathlete [VAR 0103(0000,0000)]?\cFor real?\nI can't believe it!\n
I'm watching intently!
Are you Pokéathlete [VAR 0103(0000,0000)]?\cTap... Tap... Tap...\cI can't believe it! I touched my hero!

Hi, [VAR 0103(0000,0000)]!\nDo you have anything else\ryou want to know about? [VAR 0200(0000)]
About which course? [VAR 0200(0000)]
Which event would you\nlike to know about? [VAR 0200(0000)]
In Hurdle Dash, timing is everything.\cYour Pokémon will pick up speed\nif you let them wait until the last\rmoment before they jump the Hurdles.\c
Pennant Capture...\cThis event is not only about the\nPennants on the beach, but also\rthe ones other Pokémon have collected.\cIf you bump into them from behind,\nthey will be knocked down and your\rPokémon will grab their Pennants.\cThat's the way experts fight.\c
The key is to push other Pokémon out\nof the Circles...which may be obvious.\cActually, your Pokémon can push harder\nif you pick the right moment to tell\rthem to push.\cSo you might be able to push back\npowerful Pokémon if you give frequent\rinstructions to push.\c
Block Smash is not just about smashing.\cDid you ever notice that sometimes\nthere are small cracks in the Blocks?\cWell, if you can hit those cracks,\nthey break real fast!\cIf you can aim at cracks in a row,\nyour Pokémon will feel great and\rthey'll show great potential.\cOne more thing...\cWhen you make them switch,\nflick your Pokémon upwards\rfor a quicker switch.\c
Disc Catch is about how long you can\nwait until you catch the Discs.\cBird Pokémon can move around in the\nair, so it'll be easier to catch Discs\rif you form a team of bird Pokémon.\c
Lamp Jump is not only about jumping.\cThere are three Pokémon bouncing\ntogether, so one Pokémon can't jump\rwell if another comes down right when\rthe other wants to go up in the air.\cLetting them jump at the right time\nis the key.\c
Relay Run requires well-timed switching.\cDid you notice that Pokémon start to\nsweat a little when they become tired?\cIt also indicates they have slowed down\na lot.\cYou shouldn't allow them to sweat.\cSwitching before they start to sweat,\nthat is the key.\c
It's not easy to aim for the top\nby just tackling a lot in Ring Drop.\rDo you know what a “Body Attack” is?\cI call it a Body Attack, anyway...\cYour Pokémon can actually jump\nas it moves forward.\cIf you can let your Pokémon\nBody Attack others, you can drop\rthem off the Ring altogether!\c
Snow Throw is not just about smashing.\cAre you making sure the Snowballs\nare big?\cBigger Snowballs have a better\nchance of making other Pokémon\rfall down.\cYou can also block other Snowballs\nfrom hitting your Pokémon by having\ryour Pokémon hold on to\rsome Snowballs.\c
Goal Roll requires the skills of\na Pokéathlete.\cThe situation changes every second,\nbut stay calm as you instruct\ryour Pokémon.\cPositioning is key.\cI recommend keeping one at your own\nGoal to protect it--one in the middle of\rthe field for flexibility and one in\rfront of the Goal you want to\rroll the ball into.\c
I hope you'll become a Top Pokéathlete.\nGood luck!
Those who have won at the Pokéathlon\n100 times are commemorated here for\rtheir achievement of creating the new,\rlegendary record.
It is a cool Pokégear to commemorate\nyour 100th victory in the Pokéathlon.\cThat is your model!\nIt is a special Pokégear with\rthe Pokéathlon logo in the back.
Those Pokéathletes who have come in\nfirst in every event at the Pokéathlon\r50 times are commemorated here for\rtheir overwhelming might and the\rarrival of a new legend.
It's an awesome Poké Ball to\ncommemorate your 50th victory\rin every Pokéathlon event.\cIt's your model Poké Ball!\nThe engraving reads, “Stay on Top.”

A long time ago, people used to draw\nlife from Pokémon and also give their\rlives to those Pokémon...\cThat shows that people and Pokémon\nused to be more closely bonded with\reach other.\cWhen people moved from place to place,\nthe myths and legends of Pokémon\rand their power would also be carried\rwith those people.\cThat's how myths and legends from each\nregion are blended with each other.\cThe ancient ruins here have inherited\nthe legends from both the [VAR FF00(0001)]Ruins of Alph[VAR FF00(0000)]\rin Johto and the [VAR FF00(0001)]Spear Pillar[VAR FF00(0000)] in Sinnoh.\cThat is proof that people from Johto\nand Sinnoh blended together\ras a group.

Congratulations to you, Trainer!\cIn recognition of your outstanding\nwinning streak, our Frontier Brain is\rdemanding a match with you.\cSo, your next match is against the\nFactory Head with no right of refusal!\cAre you prepared?\c
Thorton: Bzweeeeep!\cSorry, don't mind me.\cWhat I'm using is an invention of mine.\nIt's my data-interpreting machine.\cIt's telling me what you've rented\nfor this match.\cI see! You've rented [VAR 0100(0000,0000)],\n[VAR 0100(0001,0000)], and [VAR 0100(0002,0000)].\cI have to say, that's a good setup.\nLike, say, [VAR 0133(0003,0000)] percent?\rOh, don't let that number concern you!\cAll righty, let's get going!\c
Thorton: Bzweeeeep!\cLet's see what I can see about you\nthrough my data-interpreting machine.\cSo, what have you rented for this\nmatch...?\cI see!

Thorton: Hmm...\nI got handed the loss here.\cIt's not making me happy at all, losing.\nEven though I'm not happy, I did glean\rsome useful data, I suppose.\cThat makes me glad I battled you.\cSo, did you get to like those Pokémon\nyou rented?\cAs the Factory Head, it would sure make\nme happy if you did.\cNext time, come back with different\nrental Pokémon.\c
Thorton: Hmm...\nI got handed another loss.\cIt's not making me happy at all, this.\nIn fact, I'm stewing here.\cI thought I learned a lot about\nPokémon since I lost to you.\cBut that's all right.\nSome things you learn from winning.\rBut some things you learn by losing.\cI hope you'll keep renting our Pokémon\nand give me a chance to redeem myself!\c

Different touch buttons will appear\non the Touch Screen depending on\nthe situation.
Next, I'll explain the button\noperations.\n\nYou can move the main character\naround on the screen using the\n+Control Pad.
Next, I'll explain about buttons.\n\nUse the +Control Pad to move\nthe main character.\n\nYou can also use the +Control\nPad to select entries.

Don: Luck plays a big part in this.\cYou never know if Pokémon will\nappear.
Don: You won? The winner is you!?\cI'm so jealous... It'd be fantastic\nto be the winner...
Ed: My PARASECT makes Pokémon fall\nasleep with Spore.
Ed: You can't win with Pokémon that are\nrun down or low on HP.
Ed: I envy you. I just couldn't do it\nthis time.
Abby: I've been training Pokémon that\ninflict status problems for\rthis contest.
Abby: I heard that using Pokémon with\nbeautiful colors makes it easier to win.\rI wonder if that's true?
Abby: Wonderful! You sparkle and gleam\nright now. You really do!
William: Winning? I'm more interested in\nfinding rare Pokémon.
William: Well, I'm satisfied because\nI caught a Pokémon I wanted.
William: You're the winner? What did you\ncatch? Show me, show me!
Benny: ...... ...... ......\n...... ...... Ssssh!\cYou'll scare off SCYTHER.\nI'll talk to you later.
Benny: Listen, I caught a SCYTHER\nbefore, but I didn't win.
Benny: I just came to see how things\nwere going today, you know?\cI'll really try my best next time!
Barry: You should weaken bug Pokémon\nfirst, then throw a Poké Ball.
Barry: It's easier to win if you get a\nhigh-level bug Pokémon. But I think\rthey also consider some other points.
Barry: That Pokémon you caught...\nIt's awesome!
Cindy: I really love bug Pokémon!
Cindy: I really love bug Pokémon!\cDid I already say that?
Cindy: Congratulations on winning!\nBy the way...\cDid I mention that I really love bug\nPokémon?
Josh: I've been collecting bug Pokémon\nsince I was just a baby.\cThere's no way I'm going to lose!
Josh: I heard that somebody won with a\nCATERPIE!
Josh: It's called a Bug-Catching\nContest, not a Bird-Catching Contest!\cYou, of all people, should know that.\nAfter all, you won!
Samuel: What?\nIf you've got the time to chat, go find\rsome bug Pokémon.
Samuel: So... I thought I would\nscore higher...
Samuel: It's so disappointing...\nI won't forget this defeat, and...
Kipp: I've studied bug Pokémon a lot.\nI'm going to win for sure.
Kipp: I study a lot, but that's not\nenough to win.
Kipp: Could you give me some tips?\nI want to win!

Went on a great adventure with\n[VAR 0103(0002,0000)]'s [VAR 0101(0003,0000)]!

[VAR 0101(0003,0000)] saved us from a tough\nsituation! It made us closer!
Had a fun battle with [VAR 0103(0002,0000)]'s\n[VAR 0101(0003,0000)].
[VAR 0101(0001,0000)] moves very quickly!\n[VAR 0101(0003,0000)] kept away!
A big wrestling match!\n[VAR 0101(0001,0000)] barely won!
A big wrestling match!\nThat last move was crucial...!
[VAR 0101(0001,0000)] is quite agile! Or so\nit seemed, but then it fell over!
Ran around with [VAR 0103(0002,0000)]'s\n[VAR 0101(0003,0000)].
[VAR 0101(0001,0000)] was very fast! It shook\noff [VAR 0101(0003,0000)]!
[VAR 0101(0001,0000)] just hit its second wind!\nIt's showing off its reserve strength!
[VAR 0101(0001,0000)] was exhausted\nin the last half.
[VAR 0101(0003,0000)] is too fast!\nNo one can catch it!
Took a Stroll with [VAR 0103(0002,0000)]'s\n[VAR 0101(0003,0000)].
[VAR 0101(0001,0000)] pulled [VAR 0101(0003,0000)]\nalong.

[VAR 0101(0001,0000)] is walking silently next\nto [VAR 0103(0000,0000)]. What could it possibly\nbe thinking about?
[VAR 0101(0001,0000)] looked this way.\nIt's looking all around as it's walking.\nDid it find something?

My head's filled with only\n[VAR 011C(0000,0000)] now!
The way I lost...\nIt's like [VAR 011C(0000,0000)]...

When you first see them
So many it'll seem like a dream
There's no reason for it, but
Only when you're there
Whether you see them above or below,
If one walks with you as a companion
If you just try calling out its name
If you look at it from a different angle
It'll resemble a teacher
You won't be able to resist
Anytime
If you lightly poke it and see,
More than you expected
you won't be able to stop laughing!
you'll feel totally at ease.
you'll feel so hopeful.
you won't be able to look away.
you'll be held captive!
you'll be able to make a great friend!
you'll be admired by all!
it will never cease to amaze you!
you'll be intensely appealing.
you'll think it's so wonderful...
you'll be so cool.
you'll feel so strange...
you'll think that's one typical Pokémon.

Pokémon Search Party
Narrator
What has our fearless staff witnessed?\nIt's the Pokémon Search Party!
The Variety Channel that's a treasure\ntrove of laughter and tears!
At the end of the day, our search\nparty's efforts were in vain.\nThey eventually had to leave the deep\nand dark Union Cave.\n“If only we had Flash!” the leader cried.\nTune in next time for the exciting\nconclusion to the special program,\n“The Cave Plunged into Darkness”!
At the end of the day, our search\nparty's efforts were in vain.\nWe weren't able to find any UNOWN...\nTune in next time for the exciting\nconclusion in the special program,\n“Solving the UNOWN Puzzle!”
The search-party leader looked up at\nthe Johto sky and shouted a promise.\n“We won't fail again!”\nIt mixed with the sad cries of the\nSLOWPOKE that echoed continuously...\nYawn... Yaaawn...\nTune in next time for the exciting\nconclusion in the special program, “The\nDark Shadow that Kidnapped SLOWPOKE!”
The forest was dark and gloomy. We could\nhear the crunching of fallen leaves under\nour feet.\n“Leader, this is a dead end!”\n“Don't worry, let's retrace our steps.”\n“Where's the exit?”\n“Come on, we can do it!”\n“Let's just go back already...”\n“You're a guy, aren't you? Quit whining!”\n“Leader, your back...”\n“What?!”\n“On your back, a Bug-type Pokémon...”\n“Eeeeek!”\nTune in next time for the exciting\nconclusion in the special program,\n“Great Strategy in Ilex Forest!”
The leader of the search party looked\nout at the Lake of Rage, quietly\nmuttering “There's no such thing as\nunstoppable rain.”\nHe held the Fishing Rod that had been\nsnapped in two tightly in his hand, and\nheaded back to headquarters.\nTune in next time for the exciting\nconclusion in the special program,\n“Look! A Red Gyarados!”

The voyaging search party tried to\nthink of a solution to the puzzle, but\ntheir thoughts were interrupted and\nwashed away by the sound of the waves\naround the Whirl Islands.\nThe shadow of a huge Pokémon shifted and\nshook in the violent sea filled with\nwhirlpools...\nTune in next time for the exciting\nconclusion in the special program, “The\nLegend Disappeared into the Whirlpool!”
The forest was brighter than they\nthought it would be.\nAnd they saw so many Trainers there.\n“Hey, a Bug Catcher!”\n“What?”\n“He's challenged us to a battle!”\n“Then accept his challenge!”\n“But we don't have any Pokémon...”\n“Simpleton!”\nTune in next time for the exciting\nconclusion in the special program,\n“The Viridian Forest Search Party!”
We heard that there were Pokémon here,\nbut we haven't seen any yet.\nWe've come all the way here to Mt. Moon,\nas a search party looking for Pokémon.\nWe've been waiting, spending time here,\nand yet the day that we see a Pokémon\nhasn't come yet...\nWhen will we see one? What kind of\nPokémon will come to Mt. Moon?\nTune in next time for the exciting\nconclusion in the special program,\n“Rumors on Mt. Moon!”
The members of the Pokémon search\nparty are riding their Bicycles on\nRoute 17 and singing.\nLooking at their faces, they seem to be\nrelaxing and cycling along as\nthey please.\nBut they're actually doing this to search\nfor the Pokémon along the route.\nTune in next time for the exciting\nconclusion in the special program,\n“Illusion Cycling!”
The search party has become lost!\nIn this strange world, up has become\ndown, and left has become right!\nThen suddenly, right before the confused\nsearch party's eyes, it appears!\nGIRATINA!\nThere're so few accounts of anyone ever\nmeeting this Pokémon. It rarely appears.\nBut comparing GIRATINA to the few\nrecords that exist, it's appearance\nis different...\nTune in next time for the exciting\nconclusion in the special program,\n“The Strange GIRATINA!”
The search party has gone on a long\nexpedition out to the Sinnoh region.\nThe giant Mt. Coronet, rising up to the\nsky from the middle of Sinnoh...\nWithin Mt. Coronet stretches a complex\nsystem of caverns...\nSome members of the search party\nstruggled through the caverns,\nonly to ultimately arrive at a\nbroken bridge.\nThey thought they'd found ancient ruins.\nThere was a strange feeling in the air...\nTune in next time for the exciting\nconclusion in the special program,\n“Found it! The Illusion Space!”
The search party had just about\nreached the limits of its physical\nstrength, when it came to Cerulean\nCity to rest.\n“Look, such a beautiful sunset...”\n“Leader!

Trainer Profiles
Snap
We're always watching you!\nIt's time for Trainer Profiles!
That town, this town,\nbringing people together.\nThe Street Corner Channel.
This boy loves Bug types! He's so\nenergetic, and he doesn't mind running\nthrough thick grass to catch Bug-type\nPokémon! He does what he wants, on the\nhills and in the fields, this Bug Catcher!
These two are always together.\nThey have the same birthday.\nThey always eat together.\nDo you think you can tell them apart?\nThese Twins!
Flying majestically through the sky.\nRejecting the land for the open air.\nGracefully flapping its wings. Riding the\nwind to soar high into the sky.\nI want to fly there, too, sometime!\nThe Bird Keeper!
Singing in the cabin.\nLaa... Laa... La la la la...\nThe plan is to take a three-night, four-\nday holiday. To fish off the boat, hike\nin the mountains, and look for EEVEE to\nthe east and west. That's the Camper!
Greeting you with a peace sign, stuffing\ndrinks into a cooler, smiling brightly\nwhile hiking through the mountains, you\ncan see her clearly on the horizon.\nOh no! Forgot the lunchbox! The number\none rule is to protect nature.\nThe Picnicker!
Accidentally inhaling a little ocean\nwater, he now has a sore nose. Swimming\naround the rocks, pushing ahead with a\nbreaststroke, tirelessly swimming along,\nand getting a leg cramp! His lungs\nexpand easily but it's an unlucky day--\nit's raining! That poor Swimmer!
A silhouette like that of Venus. An\nadorably dazzling smile. A nickname of\n“Mermaid.” Swimming around carefree in\nthe early afternoon. Feeling hungry but\non a diet. The number of enthusiastic\nfans. Droplets of water in her dimples.\nPlaying in the water rather than taking\na walk, this Swimmer!
Dropping a line in the cold water, in\nthe hopes of catching something big.\nThe line is yanked. The float drops\nunderwater. What was caught? Some lively\nrubber boots! This poor Fisherman!
The day has come to an end, but it's still\nbright. That's strange, you'd think.\nThere's an intense fire burning, and it\nlooks like it's going to burn them.\nHe doesn't need a candle. He's a human\nablaze, carelessly playing with fire.\nThe Firebreather!
This is so cool isn't it, this Pokémon?\nThe tail is such a great shape.\nWant to trade figurines? Want to come\nover and see my collection?\nOh hey! This mark is in the wrong place.\nLooks like I fell for a counterfeit...\nBut it's art anyway!\nThat's a Poké Maniac!
I can break ten roof tiles in one chop!\nSome people think I'm just a hooligan.\nThe palm of my hand becomes covered\nin blisters. I never forget to bow, and\nI shout out to psych myself up!\nI'm the Black Belt!
Hold it close, cheek to cheek. I always\nwant to be with you, surrounded by\nwonderful Pokémon. I'll mutter your\nname. So happy, I'm dizzy.\nI love Pokémon! That's a Pokéfan!
A strong guy on a boat, plunging on\nthrough the waves. Dancing and singing\nand having a merry old time. But gentle\nas kittens once they get back on land.\nThat's a Sailor!
Had plenty of success. Learning through\nconstant repetition. Recklessly carrying\naround notebooks. Attending classes\nfor gifted kids.\nA wonderful Pokémon Trainer, that\nSchool Kid!
Hey kid, get out of my way! If you hang\naround, I'll smack you! Get out of the\nway. Out of the way. My Bike is coming\nthrough! It's so very loud, you'll cover\nyour ears! We'll line up and get in the\nway. Go ahead. Try to stop us Bikers!
Yaho... Yaho... Yahohoho...\nSinging in a loud voice without worrying\nabout what's around. A bearded man\nshouts out to the sky. From the far\nmountain. Yahohoho... So happy that the\necho came back to the Hiker!

I'm the Day-Care Man.\cWe look after the precious Pokémon\nof other Trainers.\cIf you'd like us to raise your\nPokémon, have a word with my wife.
Ah, it's you!\cWe were raising your Pokémon,\nand my goodness, were we surprised!\cYour Pokémon was holding an Egg!\cWe don't know how it got there,\nbut your Pokémon had it.\cYou do want it, don't you? [VAR 0200(0000)]
Ah, it's you! Good to see you.\nYour [VAR 0100(0000,0000)]'s doing just fine.
Well then, I'll hang on to it.\nThanks!
You have no room for it right now...\nCome back when you've made room.
[VAR 0103(0000,0000)] received the Egg from\nthe Day-Care Man.
You take good care of it.
                                                                                
                              
Ah, it's you!\nGood to see you!\cYour [VAR 0100(0000,0000)] and [VAR 0100(0001,0000)]\nare doing just fine.\c
I really will keep it.\nYou do want this Egg, yes? [VAR 0200(0000)]
Take good care of it!\cThat is, I don't think we'll ever find\nanother...\cNo, no, I'm sure we'll find another one.\nI'm definitely sure of it!\c
Well all right then, I'll take it.\nThank you.\cThat is, I don't think we'll ever find\nanother...\cNo, no, I'm sure we'll find another one.\nI'm definitely sure of it!\c
[VAR 0103(0000,0000)]...\nIf we are looking after your Pokémon\rand notice one is holding an Egg, would\ryou like me to contact you by\rphone? Would that be all right? [VAR 0200(0000)]
[VAR 0103(0000,0000)]...\nIf we are looking after your Pokémon\rand notice one is holding an Egg, would\ryou like me to contact you by\rphone? Would that be all right? [VAR 0200(0000)]
You can leave it up to us!\cAny Pokémon you'd like to have raised\nyou can leave in my wife's care.
I see. Well, that's fine.\cAny Pokémon you'd like to have raised\nyou can leave in my wife's care.
The two seem to get along very well.
The two seem to get along.
The two don't seem to like each\nother much.
The two play with other\nPokémon rather than with each other...
I'm the Day-Care Lady.\nWe can raise Pokémon for you.\cWould you like us to raise your\nPokémon? [VAR 0200(0000)]
Which Pokémon should we raise for\nyou?\c
Fine, we'll raise your [VAR 0100(0000,0000)]\nfor a while.\cCome back for it later.\c
We can raise two of your Pokémon.\nWould you like us to raise another? [VAR 0200(0000)]
Ah, there you are!\nMy husband was looking for you.
Oh, fine, then.\nCome again.
You don't have enough money...
Do you want to take back the other\none, too? [VAR 0200(0000)]
Very good.\nCome again.
Ah, it's you! Good to see you.\nNow, about your Pokémon...\c
By level, your [VAR 0100(0000,0000)] has\ngrown by about [VAR 0133(0001,0000)].\c
Your Pokémon team is full.\nMake room, then come see me.
If you want your [VAR 0100(0000,0000)] back,\nit will cost $[VAR 0135(0001,0000)]. [VAR 0200(0000)]
Excellent!\nHere's your Pokémon.\c
[VAR 0103(0001,0000)] took [VAR 0100(0000,0000)] back\nfrom the Day-Care Lady.\c
Oh? But you only have one\nPokémon with you.\cYou can't go off without a Pokémon.\nCome back another time.
Do you want your Pokémon back? [VAR 0200(0000)]
If you leave me that Pokémon,\nwhat are you gonna battle with?\cCome back another time.
Huh? Now, now.\cIf you leave that Pokémon with\nme, you'll be left with just one.\cYou will be better off if you catch\nsome more, if I do say so myself.
Now, now.\nThat is merely an Egg!
Fine, we'll raise your [VAR 0100(0000,0000)]\nfor a while.\cCome back for it later.
     
       
      
      
     
The two seem to get along very well.\c

Professor Oak: Oh, [VAR 0103(0000,0000)]!\nWhat brought you here?\c
Professor Oak: The legendary Pokémon\nthat appear in the Hoenn myth?\cYou must be talking about KYOGRE\nand GROUDON!\c
Professor Oak: The Embedded Tower is\nprobably the ruins that has something\rto do with the Hoenn myth.\rIf so, the other one must be around.\cKYOGRE and GROUDON are said to have\nshaped the seas and lands!\cWhere those two are, the other Pokémon\nis said to appear as well...\rAll this is quite possible!\c
Professor Oak: It's not hard to imagine\nthat the Red Orb will make GROUDON\rappear at the Embedded Tower...\cHowever, according to Mr. Pokémon,\nGROUDON does not show itself to\rTrainers with golden hearts, but only\rto those with shining-silver spirits.\cIt may be difficult for you alone to\naccomplish this, [VAR 0103(0000,0000)].\cBut if you manage to obtain a GROUDON\nthat came from the Embedded Tower,\cplease do come and show me both\nlegendary Pokémon!\cI will then share with you the rest of\nthe Hoenn myth!\c

Professor Oak: You did it,\n[VAR 0103(0000,0000)]!\rYou caught both KYOGRE and GROUDON!\rOK!\rI would like to entrust this to you!\c
Professor Oak: It resembles the Orb\nyou received from Mr. Pokémon,\rdoesn't it?\cIt is called the Jade Orb.\nIt has something to do with RAYQUAZA.\cLegend has it that the battle\nbetween GROUDON and KYOGRE\rshaped the lands and seas of Hoenn.\cVolcanic eruptions and giant waves are\nsaid to have completely changed the\rshape of the land there.\cBut then RAYQUAZA came down to\nhalt the battle.\cIt is a Pokémon that rules the skies!\cIf the Embedded Tower is related to\nKYOGRE and GROUDON,\cthen going there with that Jade Orb\nwill surely make something happen.\c
Professor Oak: Go to the Embedded\nTower with the Jade Orb!\c
Professor Oak: You have successfully\ncaught RAYQUAZA!\cThe strong power of the Jade Orb\nmust have attracted RAYQUAZA there!\cPokémon are sometimes greatly\nattracted by certain Orbs and Stones.\rNo one knows why.\cPerhaps memories from ancient times...\rwhen this planet was born...\rand Pokémon, also...\rare making Pokémon behave that way.\c

Huh?\nYou have no room for it right now.\cCome back when you've made room.
Professor Oak: If a wild Pokémon\nappears, your Pokémon can battle it.\cWith it at your side, you should be able\nto reach the next town...\cWhat am I saying?\nYou already know all this!\rHahaha!
Professor Oak: There is nothing more\nthat I can do for you.\cEnjoy the rest of your journey\nwith that new Pokémon!
This is Professor Oak's Pokémon.\n[VAR 0103(0001,0000)] will probably not\rsteal it like before...

Tell me, what was the first\nPokémon you ever caught?\c...Oh, really?\cI've seen lots of Pokémon around, but\nI've never caught one.\cI should give it a try sometime.\cDid you know that the first Pokémon\nMary caught was a DROWZEE?\rIsn't that so out of character?\cBut Mary's DROWZEE kept making her fall\nasleep on the job, so she traded with a\rfan for a MEOWTH.\cLet's chat about Pokémon again!\nBye-bye!
Did you know...? Ben talked with the\nradio staff on the phone for hours\rabout what Pokémon music they should\rplay on different days of the week.\cToward the end, Ben's musical\ntastes were kind of impressed\rupon them.\cThey ended up enduring Ben's\noverenthusiasm for a while.\cThey said they even kind of\nenjoyed it!\rLet's chat again!

Do you like telling fortunes?\cMe...\nI don't really like the kind where you\rpull off flower petals...\cOh, but it's not that I dislike the\nfortune-teller in Lavender Town.

Anyway, you're really something.\cTraveling all by yourself, visiting all\nthese different Gyms you find and\rbeating them all...\cWell, you're not really alone...\nYou've got Pokémon with you!
Man, this guy called Red brought\nme down in a heartbeat.\cI haven't seen him in a long time...\nI wonder where he is and what he's\rup to...\cCome to think of it, you look a little bit\nlike Red. Yeah, you do.\cJust...\nJust a little bit. Whatever...

Hey, this is Falkner.\nHow are you doing?\c
You know our plans to meet at the\nFighting Dojo in Saffron City?\rThat's still on your mind, isn't it?
My dad told me something when I was\na kid.\cHe said “Falkner, bird Pokémon don't\njust fly with their wings, they soar\rthrough the sky because that's what\rthey want to do with all their heart.”\cThat's just like my dad.
The scaffolding in my Gym was in bad\nshape when you came to battle, eh?\cEvery year, we give the place a\nthorough scrubbing. It's a challenge.\cBut the bird Pokémon help us out,\nso we're able to manage.
You've chatted with Janine in\nFuchsia City, haven't you?\cAll she ever talks about is her dad,\nyou know? Endlessly.\cI mean, it's good to have a healthy\nrespect for your dad, but it's\rbetter to have some self-confidence!\cDon't you have faith in your\nown abilities?

Wow, you seem like you're a pretty busy\nperson, aren't you? Even more than\rI am, if that could possibly be.\cI mean, I've got my Gym work, and I've\ngot to go see the Elder at the\rDragon Tamer's shrine, too.\cWhat do you think?\nYou've got talent--you could become\ra Dragon Tamer, too. Think so?

That's right... If we were to have\nanother battle, then we'd need to do it\rwhen I'm free, like on Tuesday nights.\cGive me a call then.
I'm competely free today.\nWhy don't we have a battle? [VAR 0200(0000)]
All right!\cDo you know where the Fighting Dojo is\nin Saffron City? I'll be waiting there.
I see...\nWell, you've got your own plans as well,\rI understand.
Hey! Before you battle me again, don't\nyou have someone else you promised to\rbattle with?
I'll be at the Fighting Dojo in Saffron\nCity. Get ready and meet me there!
This is Morty!\nHow are you doing?\c
Hey, didn't we make plans to meet at\nthe Fighting Dojo in Saffron City?\rI remembered!\rYou didn't forget, did you?
The legendary Pokémon: Suicune, Entei,\nand Raikou--which do you like best?\cUnlike Eusine, I don't really have any\ninterest in Suicune.\cSo I'd have to say Entei...\nBut I can't leave out Raikou...\rHmm... Guess I can't make up my mind.
You know, I once saw Entei. I mean like\nup close. It was amazing.\cEntei looked me in the eyes. I'll never\nforget its eyes.\cIt was like it could see right through\nme, down into the depths of my heart...
How have you been?\nAnything interesting happening?\cI'm doing the same as usual, just my\nregular Gym Leader duties.\cThere haven't been any really strong\nTrainers here since you came through.\cSeems like you're one of those genius\nTrainers you seldom meet.\cHa ha ha! I don't mean to flatter you!

Jasmine
Hello? I can't hear you very well...\nWe must have a bad connection...\cTry calling me again from a different\nlocation, please.
Hello... How are you?\nI'm doing well, thanks.\c
There are so many other Trainers out\nthere who are much stronger than me...\rYou should challenge them and see.
Let's see...\nI'm usually free on Wednesdays\raround noon. I could spare some time...\cWhy don't you call me again then...
Amphy's gotten better lately. I've also\nbeen able to take some time to myself.\cWhat do you think? Would you like to\nbattle me again? [VAR 0200(0000)]
Got it...\nWell, I'll see you in Saffron City at the\rFighting Dojo, OK?
I see...
Huh?\cBefore you battle me again, don't you\nhave other appointments to keep?
Got it. I'll be waiting at the Fighting\nDojo in Saffron City.\rI'll see you there.
This is Jasmine.\nHow do I sound? Healthy?\c
You didn't forget about your promise to\nmeet me for a battle, did you?\cI'm still waiting for you at the Fighting\nDojo in Saffron City...
Have you been to the Lighthouse lately?\cI've been so busy myself. I haven't\nbeen able to get over there to see\rAmphy much...\cBut...whenever I see the Lighthouse's\nlights at night, I always think,\r“I hope you're doing well, Amphy.”
Um...\nThere's something I've been meaning to\rask you... What did you think of my Gym?\rWas the atmosphere a little strange?\cBut...I mean, steel always looks\npretty cold and uninviting, but I was\rtrying to make it at least a little cute.
Warden Baoba at the Safari Zone...\nHe came over to my Gym once to\rintroduce himself...\cHe talks a little differently, doesn't\nhe? I heard it's called anastrophe...

Sabrina
Huh? I can't hear you very well.\nI wonder if it's our connection?\cTry calling again from somewhere else.
Hello...\nAnything new going on with you?\rI'm the same as usual.\c
There are stronger Gym Leaders\nthan me, you know. That's no good!
I think I've got some free time on\nSundays around noon.\cCould you call me back then?
Ah, wonderful!\nI've got some free time right now.\cWould you like to battle again? [VAR 0200(0000)]
I knew it. That's just like you.\cSo, I'll see you at the Fighting Dojo in\nSaffron City then!
I see...\nYou have the right to refuse an offer.\rI shouldn't have gotten my hopes up.\rBut I'm still a little disappointed...
Do you really have some free time to\nbattle me?\cIf you've got plans with other people,\nyou should really do that first.
I'll be waiting in Saffron City's\nFighting Dojo. Don't forget!
Yeah, this is Sabrina.\nHow are you doing?\c
So, I'm pretty sure we made plans to\nmeet at the Fighting Dojo in\rSaffron City... Did you really forget?
I'll tell you a little about a Psychic's\ntraining.\cPsychic ability is the power to influence\npeople.\cYou close your eyes and clear your mind\nof excessive thoughts...then you look\rhard at your sleeping self.\cThat's it.\cTrue Psychics aren't the kind who can\nmove things around with their minds.\cIt's about controlling your own mind.
You... You'll become even stronger\nthan you are now, I know it...\cYou will defeat every Trainer you face\nand eventually reach the\rglowing glory...\cI just wanted to tell you that.\nTalk to you later!
You are a great Trainer, with a good\nbalance between intellect, power, and\ryour heart.\cBut above all, the power of your heart\nis what is special.\cWhat do you think of honestly trying to\nstudy how to be a Psychic once to see?\cI bet you could become a better Psychic\nthan me if you tried...

Chuck
Huh? Wha...? I can't hear you.\nMaybe we've got a bad connection.\cGo somewhere else and try\ncalling again!
Hello?!\nOh, hey, sorry for shouting!\cI'm doing great!\c
You know there're some stronger\nGym Leaders around.\rDon't lose heart! Keep going!
Let's see... I'm free most Wednesday\nnights. Give me a call then, OK?
Oh hey! I just finished training.\nDo you want to battle again? [VAR 0200(0000)]
All right!\cI'll be waiting over at the Fighting Dojo\nin Saffron City!
Noooooo!\nThat's terrible!
Hmm... You're just battling me, right?\nDon't you have other plans?
I'll be waiting at the Fighting Dojo in\nSaffron City.\rLook forward to it!
Yo! Chuck here!\nWhat's up?\c
Hey, didn't we make plans to meet at\nthe Fighting Dojo in Saffron City?\rDon't tell me you forgot?\rCome on, man! I'm waiting!
You know, I spend a lot of time training\nunder a pounding waterfall every day.\cI guess that's why I've been\ndisagreeing with my wife a lot lately.\cI was thinking of taking her on a trip as\nan apology, but I can't think of any\rgood places to go.\c...That's it!\cI should take her to Tohjo Falls! What\ndo you think?
You know, I'm just going to say this\nonce, but I...\cI really like sweets. They're the best.\cAfter training every day, the thing\nthat I absolutely look forward to more\rthan anything is sneaking behind my\rwife's back to eat something sweet.\cFortunately, I haven't been packing on\ntoo many pounds...\cOh! Don't tell my wife! Please!
Lately my Gym's waterfall device has\nbeen malfunction... Aaaaahh!\cBoomwhooshoowhooshoowhoosh\roowhooshoowhooshoowhoosh\roowhooshoowhooshoowhoosh...!\c...Haa haaa haaaaa. Sorry.\nWhile I was on the phone with you, the\rdevice broke and I just got doused\rwith water.\cI'll call you back once things have\ncalmed down a bit here!

Brock
Huh? I can't hear you. I think we've\ngot a bad connection.\cGo somewhere else and call again!
Hello...\nWhat's up?\rI'm doing great!\c
Hmm... I'd like to battle you again, but\nI think there're some Gyms that you\rhaven't visited yet, aren't there?
I can take a break on Saturday\nevenings, if you want to give me a call\ragain then.
Hey, you called at just the right time!\nI'm free right now.\rWant to battle me again? [VAR 0200(0000)]
All right, all right!\nI'm looking forward to it!\cI'll meet you at the Fighting Dojo in\nSaffron City!\cI won't be at the Pewter Gym, all right?\nDon't get confused!
Is that so...\nWell, I suppose you must have a lot of\rthings to do yourself...
Yeah, I'd really like to battle with you\nagain... But I think you've got an\rappointment with someone else?\cOnce you've taken care of your\nobligations with other Trainers,\rthen call me again!
I'll be waiting for you to arrive at\nthe Fighting Dojo in Saffron City.\rIt's a promise between Trainers!
This is Brock.\nOh hey, how are you doing?\c
We made plans to battle at the Fighting\nDojo in Saffron City, didn't we?\rYou didn't forget, did you?
A large earthquake struck recently.\nSome of the walls in my Gym\rcrumbled a bit.\cWell, I guess that's just the kind of\nthing my Gym's known for.\cSo even if the walls crumbled a bit,\nnobody would really notice!
There are so many different types of\nPokémon in the world. As you could\rguess, I like Rock-type Pokémon best.\cThey're solid and rough, and yet\nsomewhat brittle at the same time.\rOnce you've really gotten to know\rthem, they're even quite cute.\cWhat do you think?
Every town's Pokémon Gym is different!\nThe design, the tricks, everything is so\rdifferent. It's interesting!\cEach Gym Leader assigned to take care\nof a Gym by the Pokémon League gets to\rdesign as they please.\cOf course, Pewter Gym's design is my\npride and joy!\cThe tricks aren't much, but you can't\ndeny that when you enter, the design\rhas a breathtaking impact, right?

Bugsy
Huh? I can't hear you very well!\nI think we've got a bad connection.\cCall me back from somewhere else!
Hello? How are you?\nI'm doing great as usual!\c
There are so many stronger Gym\nLeaders than me out there.\cYou're trying to visit every Gym around\nthe region, aren't you?\rThat's great! Keep up the good work!
On Thursdays around noon, I'm\nusually free.\rIf you want to see my Bug-type Pokémon\ragain, you should call me then!
Oh, you called at just the right time!\nI'm not doing anything right now.\rWanna battle again? [VAR 0200(0000)]
All right!\cSee you at the Fighting Dojo in\nSaffron City!
I see...\nWell, there's no helping that...
Huh?\nIt's great that you want to battle,\rbut don't you have other plans?\cYou should take care of those plans\nfirst, and then give me a call.
All right, I'll be waiting for you at the\nFighting Dojo in Saffron City!\rRace you there!
Yeah, this is Bugsy...\nWhat's up?\c
Hey, didn't we make plans to meet at\nthe Fighting Dojo in Saffron City for a\rbattle? Did you forget or something?
You know, everyone's really into\nBug-type Pokémon when they're kids.\cBut then for some reason, as people\ngrow up, at some point they all start\rto like Bug-type Pokémon less and less.\cHow about you?\nDo you still like Bug-type Pokémon?\cEven if I grow up I'll never stop liking\nBug-type Pokémon, no way!
My Gym has such a different trick to it,\ndoesn't it?\cIt may seem like it was really difficult\nto get a trick like that set up...\rBut the truth is, it was actually\rpretty easy.\cFirst we ran the ropes through the\nGym, then all the Pokémon helped us\rfinish everything else up!
I think I've already mentioned this to\nyou, but did you know I'm doing\rresearch on Bug-type Pokémon?\cThere's so many different kinds, it's a\nbit difficult, you know?\cI'm just studying Bug-type Pokémon,\nand yet it's still this difficult.\cPeople like Professor Elm and\nProfessor Oak who study all the\rdifferent types of Pokémon are really\rsomething else, you know?

Pryce
What? I can't hear you very well.\nI think we've got a bad connection.\cWell, if you have something you want to\ntalk to me about, go somewhere else and\rtry calling again.
Hello...\nOh, hi, how are you?\rI'm doing fine, thanks.\c
You know, there are Gym Leaders out\nthere who are stronger than me.\rYou should try battling them.\rI don't think you'd lose.
I usually get up pretty early...\nIf we're going to battle, I'm at my best\rin the morning... How about you give me\ra call on Monday morning!
Oh, perfect timing!\nI was starting to get bored...\rDo you want to battle again? [VAR 0200(0000)]
Honesty is good.\cSo, I'll meet you at the Fighting Dojo in\nSaffron City, then?
I see. Well, that's how it's got\nto be...\cIf you ever change your mind, give me\na call.\cRemember, I'm free on Monday mornings.
Hmm. Do you really have the time to\nbattle me right now?\cIf you've got plans with other people,\nyou should take care of those first,\rdon't you think?
All right, I will see you at the\nFighting Dojo in Saffron City.\rI won't be late. Don't worry!
Yes, this is Pryce.\nHow are you doing?\c
We made plans to battle at the Fighting\nDojo in Saffron City.\rYou didn't forget, did you?\rI'm waiting there for you.
Just like one of my children...\cNo.\cYou're more like one of my\ngrandchildren...\cThere's such an age difference between\nmyself and the Trainers who defeat me\rnowadays...\cBut you know, the strange thing is that\nwhen I lose, I don't feel disappointed.\cI just feel happy.\cJust happy that such talented Trainers\nhave come to see me.\c...I just wanted to talk to someone\nabout that, so I called you.\cThat's all.
Do you know why they call me the winter\nTrainer? Do you recall that my middle\rname is “Willow”?\cThe willow tree looks like it withers in\nwinter's cold. But really, it sprouts\rdozens of new buds.\cMy fighting style is also strong just\nlike that...\cIt's written in old books, you know.\nYou should look it up sometime.
That reminds me, you kept Team\nRocket's treachery in check, right?\cHumph...\nThat's a praiseworthy deed and an\rappropriate responsibility for a Trainer\rwho could defeat me.\cI think there's still several things I\ncould stand to learn from you.\cI'm looking forward to it.

Whenever MARILL gets annoyed, it hops\nin the water.\cRecently it jumped into the bath, and\nthere was water all over the place!\cWell, I'll talk to you more about\nPokémon later!
It's so helpful the Pokémon Center\nwill heal your Pokémon for you for free.\cThe first thing I do every time I arrive\nin a town is look for the nearest\rPokémon Center.\cKeep up the great work, [VAR 0103(0000,0000)]!
I took a BULBASAUR for a walk on\nRoute 1 the other day!\cIt really seemed like it was enjoying it!
You know, I wonder what it'd be like\ntaking a CHARMANDER for a stroll along\rRoute 2...\cI heard that CHARMANDER really like\nthat area.
You know, I've heard that people who\ntake a SQUIRTLE for a walk on Route 3\rtend to fall down!
Speaking of... Mt. Moon is on Route 4,\nisn't it?\cIf I recall correctly, CLEFAIRY really\nlike Mt. Moon!
You know there's a Fighting Dojo in\nSaffron City? The Pokémon I had with me\rwere all really surprised!
You know, I went to the port in\nVermilion City.\rAll of my Pokémon had so much fun riding\ron the S.S. Aqua!
You know, I took a PORYGON for a walk in\nCeladon City...and I heard this weird,\r“Jijiji...” sound.\rIt was like it was trying to speak!
You know how there's a guy named\nMr. Psychic in Saffron City?\cI wonder what would happen if you took\nPsychic-type Pokémon there?
Hey, have you been to the Rock Tunnel\nyet?\cIf you take an ONIX with you there,\nit becomes so happy!
Hey, you know if you ever get the\nchance to go to the Power Plant, you\rshould take a PIKACHU with you.\cIt's really fun!
Hey, you know that DIGLETT's Cave near\nRoute 11?\cSpeaking of the Pokémon that you\nshould take with you there...\rWell, I probably don't need to tell you!
Where are you right now?\nRoute 12?\cI see... Oh!\nYou should visit the Pokémon House in\rLavender Town!
Where are you now?\nRoute 13?\cIsn't that where the road becomes a\nbit of a maze?\cThat might be why the Pokémon in that\narea always seem a bit perplexed.
So, you're around Route 14 right now,\naren't you?\cThere's a huge windmill over in that\narea, so it's very beautiful, isn't it?
Where are you now? Route 15?\cHow about stopping by the Warden of\nthe Pal Park's house in Fuchsia?\cThere're so many AIPOM there.\nIt's fun!
You're at Route 16 right now?\nSo, you're pretty close to Cycling Road\rthen, aren't you?\cIt's so much fun running with your\nPokémon...but of course that'd be\ra little dangerous there!
You're at Route 17 right now?\nSo that means...\ryou're on the Cycling Road!\cIt's so much fun running with your\nPokémon...but of course, that'd be\ra little dangerous there!
You're at Route 18 right now?\nSo, you're pretty close to Cycling Road\rthen, aren't you?\cIt's so much fun running with your\nPokémon...but of course, that'd be\ra little dangerous there!
You know, whenever I get over by\nRoute 19, I always want to go play in\rthe water with my Pokémon, don't you?\rI think it'd be so much fun...
Come to think of it...when you're near\nwater with Fire-type Pokémon, they\rseem to really not enjoy it...\rI understand how they feel!
Sitting on Route 21 with your Pokémon,\nwatching the sunset over the beach...\rWhat do you think about that?\rIt seems weird to me, 'cause that's\rmore of a romantic couple thing to do!
You know, Route 22 is the road to the\nPokémon League, so I bet it makes your\rPokémon feel pretty nervous, huh?
You know, the bridge on Route 24 is\ncalled the “Nugget Bridge.”\cIt's not an official name, but it seems\nlike a lot of people call it that.\cThe sun's light reflects off the water\nthere, so it's kind of dazzling...
You know, I think most Pokémon have\nnever seen their own face.\cSo if you take them to a puddle on\nRoute 25 and let them see their\rreflection, I wonder what\rthey'll think...
You know, Route 26 is so full of natural\nbeauty, I bet it's a really wonderful\rplace for Pokémon.\cBut it's also a road leading to the\nPokémon League, so it probably makes\rthem anxious, too.
You know, I've heard that sometimes\nPokémon will find things along Route 27.\cIt's probably a good idea to take along\nthe Pokémon you have the closest\rfriendship with.
Route 28, that's the one going to\nMt. Silver, isn't it?\cI'm sure that must make your Pokémon\nworry a little bit, too.
Oh, that's right. How is it to take\nCHIKORITA with you to Route 29?\cI bet it will look like it's having\ngreat fun!
Oh, that's right. How is it to take\nTOTODILE with you to Route 30?\cI bet it will look like it's having\ngreat fun!
You know, I bet it would be really\ninteresting to take CYNDAQUIL with you\rto Route 31!\cI heard that CYNDAQUIL really like\nthat area!
Hey, you can find UNOWN in the\nRuins of Alph, right? I wonder what\rwould happen if you already had one and\rtook it for a walk through the ruins?
You know, it's always raining on\nRoute 33. It never stops!\cI get kind of down on rainy days, but I\nknow there's Pokémon out there that\rlove the rain!\c...Like TOTODILE!
You know, FARFETCH'D are known to have\na strange fascination with Ilex Forest.\rWhen they're there, it's like they\rdon't even hear you.\cI think I might take a FARFETCH'D there\nto see for myself sometime.
Hey, did you know?\nWhen Pokémon go to the Pokéathlon,\rthey get really excited and fired up!\cI think I'll take my Pokémon over there\nsoon, too!
Did you know that something really\ninteresting happens if you take a\rSUDOWOODO to Route 36?\cWhat kind of interesting?\nWell, you'll just have to try it\rand see!
Hey, did you meet the twins over on\nRoute 37?\cThey're so cute, and their Pokémon are\nvery popular.
I took a TAUROS over to Moomoo Farm\nrecently. There was such an uproar,\rI didn't know what to do!
You know, you should take a MILTANK\nwith you over to Route 39.\cIt will find so many friends over there.\nIt'll be great fun!
You should take a POLIWAG over to\nRoute 40 sometime and see what\rhappens!\cYou'll see something interesting.\nThat's for sure!
You know, Water-type Pokémon really\nlove the sea...\cWatching your Pokémon having fun and\nbeing really happy is enough to make\ryou feel happy, too!
Is everything all right?\nYou know, Route 42 is a mountain road.\rIf you take a Rock-type Pokémon\rthrough there, I bet they'd enjoy it.
You know, if you'd like to see MAGIKARP\nget really excited, you should take it\rover to the Lake of Rage and see\rwhat happens!
Right now you're...on Route 44!\cWas I right? All right!\cIt's pretty cold around there, right?\nI feel bad for the Pokémon that are\rsensitive to cold...\cBut I bet Ice-type Pokémon feel\nright at home!
You know, there's that river that\nmeanders around near Route 45.\rIt's a fun route to take.\cI went there recently, and my Pokémon\nwere really interested in the river.\rThey kept looking out at it.
Hey, you know how there's so much tall\ngrass on Route 46?\rWell, the Pokémon you have with you\ralso become worried about when a wild\rPokémon will come leaping out!
You know, Route 47 has such a\nbeautiful, natural view!\c...That said, have you heard of DITTO?\cDITTO get really energetic around\nRoute 47. It's kind of strange...
Hey...\nYou know how there's that really tall\rcliff near Route 48?\cWhen you're walking around there, the\nPokémon with you all get pretty\rscared, too...\cMe?\nMe, I'm...always shaking with fear!
Where are you now?\nPallet Town... That means you're over\rby Professor Oak's place!\cThe professor really likes Pokémon.\cYou should take a Pokémon over to\nProfessor Oak's Laboratory sometime!
Where are you now? Viridian City? That's\nwhere the Trainer House is, right?\cWhen Pokémon go over there, they get\nreally fired up, you know!
So, where are you now? Viridian City?\nOh, you're in Pewter City!\cIn Pewter there's a museum, right?\cYou can take Pokémon over to the\nmuseum with you for a fun field trip!
So, where are you now?\nCerulean City, you say?\cSo...did you meet the Cerulean Gym\nLeader, Misty?\cOh, nothing. Just wondering.
Where are you now?\nLavender Town?\rYou've gone pretty far, huh?\cIn that town, there's a place called\nthe House of Memories where they have\rPokémon graves, you know.\cAs a Trainer, you should visit at least\nonce out of respect.
Where are you now? Vermilion City?\cThat's where the Pokémon Fan Club is if\nI recall correctly!\cIf you've got a BAYLEEF, you should\ntake it over there to them and say hi!
So, where are you now?\nCeladon City? I see...\cThat reminds me. I once took a TANGELA\nwith me to Celadon. It was so happy...\rand something happened!\cYou should try it, too, and see what\nhappens!
So, where are you now? Fuchsia City?\nYou just pop up in the strangest\rplaces, don't you?\cThat reminds me. I heard that if you\ntake a TAUROS to Fuchsia, they get\rreally agitated!\cI wonder why... I don't really get it.\nBut I bet it would be interesting to try\rit and see what happens!
So, where're you now? Cinnabar?\nYou've gone pretty far, haven't you?\cStanding with your Pokémon, looking\nout to sea while standing in a town\rthat was buried in lava...\cThat seems almost like the final scene\nfrom a movie or something!
You know, when a friend of mine went to\nthe Indigo Plateau, the Pokémon with\rmy friend got so excited that they were\rmaking loud snorting noises!
So, where are you now?\nOh, you're in Saffron City?\cThat's where the Copycat's house\nis, right?\cYou should take a MIME JR. over there\nand see what happens.\cI bet it's something interesting!

So, where are you now?\nOh, you're at the National Park!\rI really like that Park, too.\cIt might just be my imagination, but I\nthink the Bug-type Pokémon do, too!
So, you're at the Ruins of Alph now?\cThat's where you can find UNOWN, right?\nDid you catch any yet?\cYou know, if you have an UNOWN, you\nshould take it there.
So, where are you now?\nThe Safari Zone?\cIt's a bit far to walk to get there, but\nit's definitely worth it. There're so\rmany different Pokémon there!

You know how there's a guy named\nMr. Psychic in Saffron City?\cI wonder what would happen if you took\nPsychic-type Pokémon there?

There's a Pokémon House in\nLavender Town. You should take your\rPokémon there. I think it would\renjoy it.
Hey, Route 13 is the one that's a bit\nof a maze, isn't it?\cThat may be why the Pokémon in that\narea always seem a bit perplexed.

Have you had the chance to take\nthe Cycling Road yet?\cIt's so much fun running with your\nPokémon...but of course that'd be a\rlittle dangerous there!

It's so much fun to play with Pokémon\nalong the water's edge!\cIf I recall correctly, you can see the\nsea from Route 19...

You know, if you're headed to Route 21,\nI've got a suggestion for you.\cYou could sit with your Pokémon,\nwatching the sunset over the beach...\cWhat do you think...? It's more of a\nromantic couple's thing isn't it!

You know, there's a really big bridge\non Route 24 called the\r“Nugget Bridge.”\cIt's not an official name, but it seems\nlike a lot of people call it that.\cThe sun's light reflects off the water\nthere, so it's kind of dazzling...
Hey, you know how there's that big\npuddle on Route 25? I think most\rPokémon have never seen their\rown face.\cI wonder what they would think if they\nsaw their reflection in that puddle...
You know, Route 26 is so full of natural\nbeauty. I bet that it's a really\rwonderful place for Pokémon.\cBut it's also a road leading to the\nPokémon League, so it probably makes\rthem nervous, too.
You know, I've heard that sometimes\nPokémon will find things along Route 27.\cIt's probably a good idea to take along\nthe Pokémon you have the closest\rfriendship with.

What do you think about taking\nCHIKORITA with you to Route 29?\cI bet it will look like it's having\ngreat fun!
What do you think about taking\nTOTODILE with you to Route 30?\cI bet it will look like it's having\ngreat fun!
What do you think about taking\nCYNDAQUIL with you to Route 31?\cI bet it will look like it's having\ngreat fun!

You know, it's always raining on\nRoute 33. It never stops!\cI get kind of down on rainy days, but I\nknow there's Pokémon out there that\rlove the rain!\c...Like TOTODILE!

I took a TAUROS over to Moomoo Farm\non Route 39 recently. There was such\ran uproar, I didn't know what to do!
You know, if you're going over to\nRoute 39, you should take a MILTANK\ralong with you.\cIt will find so many friends over there,\nit'll be great fun!
You know, if you're headed over to\nRoute 40, you should take a POLIWAG\rwith you and see what happens!\cYou'll see something interesting.\nThat's for sure!
I recently went over to Route 41 to\nhave fun. You know, Water-type Pokémon\rreally love the sea...\cWatching your Pokémon have fun and\nbe happy is enough to make\ryou happy, too!
You know, Route 42 is a mountain road.\nIf you take a Rock-type Pokémon\rthrough there, I bet they'd enjoy it.
You know, if you'd like to see MAGIKARP\nget really excited, you should take it\rover to the Lake of Rage and see\rwhat happens!

Did you know that there's a huge\nBug-Catching Contest in the\rNational Park?\cThat's why there're so many Bug-type\nPokémon there. If you took your\rBug-type Pokémon there too, I bet\rthey'd really enjoy it!
I heard from someone that you can find\na Pokémon called UNOWN in the\rRuins of Alph.\cSo, if that's true...I wonder if that\nwould change if you already had an\rUNOWN and you took it with you to\rthe Ruins of Alph...
It's a bit far to walk to get to the\nSafari Zone, but it's definitely worth\rit. There're so many different\rPokémon there!

Look for Pokémon in grassy areas!\c
Good. I see you understand how to use\nPoké Balls.\c
You're getting good at this,\nbut you have a long way to go.\c
Hmm, you're catching Pokémon at a\ndecent pace!\c
You're trying--I can see that.\nYour Pokédex is coming together.\c
You're training them well. You know\nsome Pokémon don't evolve just by\rbattling with others, right?\c
Do you have a Fishing Rod?\nThere are some Pokémon that can only\rbe found by fishing!\c
Excellent! You seem to be good at\ncollecting things!\c
Some Pokémon only appear during\ncertain times of the day.\c
Your Pokédex is really filling up.\nKeep up the good work!\c

If you break rocks, some Pokémon that\nwere hiding there might come\rjumping out!\c
That's wonderful you've been able\nto gather this many Pokémon! The path\rahead is long. Keep up the great work!\c
If you Headbutt a tree, sometimes\na Pokémon might fall out!\c
A lot of Pokémon not found in the\nJohto region like to congregate at the\rSafari Zone.\c
Music on the radio might also entice\nPokémon to leap out!\c
Wow, you've gotten so far...!\nI'm actually a little surprised!\c

Well, now that we've made each other's\nacquaintance, shall we trade phone\rnumbers? [VAR 0200(0000)]
Lovely!\nNow I shall be able to call you anytime.
I see...\cAs to be expected, children prefer to\nspend time with others their own age...
You don't really want to trade\nphone numbers with me, do you? [VAR 0200(0000)]
What's wrong? Aren't we on the same\nfloor right now?\cWhy not talk in person?
I was so surprised!\nA few days ago, I received a NOCTOWL\rwhen I traded with someone.\cIt turns out that NOCTOWL was the same\none I gave away in a trade with another\rTrainer years ago!\cI guess that's a case of “What goes\naround, comes around,” in that it came\rback to me.\cThe world is small after all!
It's kind of disappointing.\nA few days ago, I received a NOCTOWL\rwhen I traded with someone.\cIt was such a familiar NOCTOWL...\cI thought it was the NOCTOWL that I had\noriginally trained!\cIt'd somehow found its way back...\nI was so moved...\rBut when I looked closer, I saw that\rit wasn't the NOCTOWL I thought it was.\cThat kind of thing can't really happen\nin this world, right?
You know, whenever I try to catch a\nwild Pokémon, they seem to always run\raway. It's happened so many times.\cA couple days ago a RATTATA got away\nfrom me...\cYou know, whenever I meet a person or\nPokémon, I always make sure to take off\rmy hat and introduce myself properly,\rand that's when they run away.\cRATTATA are such impolite creatures...
Ha ha, would you like to battle again?\nI think that's a fine idea!\cI'll meet you at [VAR 0104(0003,0000)]!
Is everything all right?\nDid you forget about our appointment?\cI'm waiting at [VAR 0104(0003,0000)].\nI will see you there!
Just like this, when calling a young\nperson such as yourself, you can trade\rinformation.\cJust like this, Pokémon bring people\ntogether, don't they?\cTruly, Pokémon are such\nextraordinary creatures.

Man! You're as tough as ever!\cI've battled you over and over, but\n[VAR 0103(0000,0000)], I haven't won once.\cI bought tons of items to toughen up my\nPokémon, but to no avail...\cItems alone aren't the answer.\nThat must be what it is...\cHere, take this, [VAR 0103(0000,0000)].\nI won't be needing it anymore...\c
Wow, when you call from inside the\nLighthouse, your voice just kind of\rechoes. It's kind of cool!
How are your Pokémon doing?\nMy Pokémon are a bit too energetic.\c[VAR 0100(000A,0000)], especially.\cEvery time it spots a Trainer, it just\ncharges ahead into battle!\cIt gets to be a bit much for me!\nLater!
My [VAR 0100(000A,0000)]'s looking tougher\nthan ever.\cIt looks even tougher than me!\nLater!
Hey, I challenge you to a battle!\nIt won't be like last time!\c[VAR 0104(0003,0000)]'s where I'm waiting\nfor you. Hustle over here pronto!

Hey, can I get your number?\nI'll ring you up to battle. [VAR 0200(0000)]

Oh, all right...\nBut I won't lose to you again!
Can I get your phone number?\cI don't want to lose against you!\nWe have to battle again, OK? [VAR 0200(0000)]

Hey, you're nearby, aren't you? What's\nwith the phone call? Come talk to me!
Hey, do you remember my super-cool\n[VAR 0100(000A,0000)]?\cMy [VAR 0100(000A,0000)] is different from\nregular [VAR 0100(000A,0000)].\cIt's like my [VAR 0100(000A,0000)] is in the top\npercentage of [VAR 0100(000A,0000)].\cDo you know what I'm saying?
Oh yeah, I took down a [VAR 0100(000B,0000)]\nin the wild the other day.\cIt was a cakewalk. Well, I guess it\ncan't be helped, us being so tough.\cAll right. Later!
Oh yeah, I saw a wild [VAR 0100(000B,0000)]!\nI thought about going for it, but\rthen I failed!\cOh well. I guess that's just the way\nit goes. I'm not very good at catching\rPokémon...
Let's get together and battle!\nI promise things will be different!\c[VAR 0104(0003,0000)]'s where I'll be.\nGive me a shout when you come.\cAll right. Later!

Well, that was a very interesting\nbattle now, wasn't it?\cWhen I'm fishing here, I sometimes\ncatch items that people have dropped.\rIf I find anything, I'll give it to you.\cWill you give me your\nphone number? [VAR 0200(0000)]
If I snag anything good, I'll be sure to\nlet you know.
All right... Come back if you have a\nchange of heart.
If I snag an item while I'm fishing,\nit's yours. Trade me numbers? [VAR 0200(0000)]
Ah! Here it is!\cCome on!\nI caught a Poké Ball!\cIt's kind of covered with algae and\nseaweed. I can't really tell what kind\rof Poké Ball it is, but I bet you know!\c
Shhh!!!\nThe POLIWHIRL will run away!\cDon't bother calling me, come talk to me\nin person, that way we can whisper!
My [VAR 0100(000A,0000)]'s grown impressive!\nMy fishing skills have improved, too!\cWe beat a wild [VAR 0100(000B,0000)]...\nYou know, I have more fun fishing\rthan beating wild Pokémon.\cAll right, later.
My [VAR 0100(000A,0000)]'s grown impressive!\nMy fishing skills have improved, too!\cBut some time ago, we came this close\nto landing a wild [VAR 0100(000B,0000)].\rI tell you, it was huge. Believe me.\cAll right, later.
I'm fishing on [VAR 0104(0003,0000)], but\nnothing's biting today.\cHelp me while my time away--come over\nfor a battle.
Sigh...They're not biting like before on\n[VAR 0104(0003,0000)]...\cYou have to come for a battle!
Nah, I haven't found anything that's\nworth your time.\cYou have to have patience.
I snagged an item while fishing.\nCome pick it up on [VAR 0104(0003,0000)]!
Don't you want this item?\nHah? You don't know where?\c[VAR 0104(0003,0000)]...\nJust head from Mahogany toward\rBlackthorn!

You're very good at battling.\nWe should battle again sometime.\cBy challenging a tough Trainer like you,\nI think I can get better, too.\cSo how about it?\nWould you give me your\rphone number? [VAR 0200(0000)]
Let's battle again sometime!
That's too bad...\nLet me know if you change your mind.
By challenging a tough Trainer like you,\nI think I can get better, too.\cSo how about it? Would you give me\nyour phone number? [VAR 0200(0000)]

Huh? You... Aren't you nearby?\cWhy not come here and just talk to me\nface-to-face?
Do you remember my\nsweet [VAR 0100(000A,0000)]?\c[VAR 0100(000A,0000)] runs very fast.\cIt's exhilarating to ride on its\nback when it really gets going.\cBye-bye!
Oh, have you ever seen a [VAR 0100(000B,0000)]\nbefore?\cI just battled one...\nIt was much faster than I expected.\cI was a little shocked.\nI still won, of course.\cBye-bye!
Oh, I just saw a wild [VAR 0100(000B,0000)].\nI was trying to catch it when I\rnoticed that I was all out of\rPoké Balls.\cIf you don't check your items, you\nmay run out at the worst time.\rI hope you learn from my mistake.\cBye-bye!
Do you want to battle? I'm going to win\nthis time!\cI'll be waiting for you around\n[VAR 0104(0003,0000)]. Look for me, OK?

Hey! What're you, nervous?
Oh, I see you've finally figured out\njust how amazing I am?\cWell, that's to be expected. Let's\ntrade phone numbers! [VAR 0200(0000)]
Well, I probably look a lot scarier than\nI really am. Would you believe I'm really\ra nice guy?\cI won't bite, so come and talk to me\nin person!
Yo, Teddy! You do a pretty good\nimpression of a motorcycle!\cNext time you get a chance, you and I\nshould go riding and yell like\rmotorcycles. What do you say?\c......Wait, who is this?\cOh no! Wrong number!\nSorry!
My [VAR 0100(000A,0000)] does a great job!\nAnyway, its fighting spirit is different.\cIt's never lost to any but the\nstrongest Pokémon!\cWhat about your Pokémon?\nDo they have any fighting spirit?\cNever mind, you don't have to answer.\cI should know better than anyone just\nhow strong your Pokémon are!
We're a Biker gang, you know.\nGot Pokémon with poison,\rwith spikes all over their bodies,\rwith fangs, and we even have some\rGhost-type Pokémon.\rIt's all a big show of how tough we are.\cBut...\cAs for me...\cI really like cute Pokémon like MARILL!
So, yesterday I thought I was gonna\ncatch a [VAR 0100(000B,0000)].\rBut that [VAR 0100(000B,0000)], it took one look\rat me and ran off!\cIt was totally rude!\cYou wouldn't run away if you saw me,\nwould you...?
Yo! So, I really wanna battle you again.\nI mean, I am really itching to show off!\cI'm always hanging out on\n[VAR 0104(0003,0000)]. Don't get all\rnervous and run away, got it?!
What's going on with you?\nI'm waiting on [VAR 0104(0003,0000)]!\cYou wouldn't forget a promise you made\nwith a buddy, would you?
You know, my bro Markey was talking\nabout this earlier... Have you thought\rabout joining our team at all?\cWe hang out on Cycling Road and make a\nlot of noise, throw our garbage around,\rthen pick up our garbage and take it\rhome to throw away. It's so much fun!

You had fun battling us, right?\cSo how about we exchange phone\nnumbers, and that way if we want to\rbattle again, we can just give each\rother a call? [VAR 0200(0000)]
All right, now you've got our number\nand we have yours.
Oh? But... Oh well.
Did you decide you wanted to trade\nnumbers after all? [VAR 0200(0000)]
All right, here you go!\nIt's an Oval Stone.\c

Didn't it, Kay?\cYeah, and we were so surprised we just\nran away. Didn't we, Tia?\cI keep thinking about it, Kay, and\nI think that since we have Pokémon,\rwe should have just battled, right?\cIs it hard to tell who's who when you're\ntalking to both of us on the phone?
We should have another battle, just\nthe three of us.\cWe're on [VAR 0104(0003,0000)], so come on\nover when you get the chance.
Didn't we make plans to have\nanother battle?\cWe're waiting on [VAR 0104(0003,0000)], so\ndon't forget, OK?
Well, since we're on the phone, how\nabout we give you a quiz?\c...\cSo, who's speaking right now? Kay or\nTia?\c...\n...\r...\r...\rThe correct answer is...\cEleanor from the Pokémon Fan club,\nwho's standing next to the twins!

I'm still a featherweight, as usual...\cMy constant companion, [VAR 0100(000A,0000)],\nis training hard!\cIt even knocked out a [VAR 0100(000B,0000)] in\nunder two seconds in a recent battle!\cOK, OK, two seconds is a bit of an\nexaggeration... It was actually five\rminutes and 37 seconds...

My Pokémon was holding something in its\nmouth recently.\cI was thinking “What in the world?” and\nI pulled it out... It was a Shiny Stone!\rI was surprised. Wouldn't you be?\c...But what's a Shiny Stone?\cI don't really have any use for it, and\nI don't know what it's worth...so I'll\rjust give it to you!\cI'll wait for you on [VAR 0104(0003,0000)].\nCome get it!

Huh? Is that thing a Pokédex? Have you\nmet Professor Oak?\cHuh? You have?\nThat's way cool!\cI have a dream of becoming a Pokémon\nresearcher like Professor Oak.\cMay I please have your phone number?\cWe should chat about Professor Oak.\cI'm sure it will be loads of fun! [VAR 0200(0000)]
You must listen to Professor Oak's\nPokémon Talk, right?
Oh... I wish I had a chance to meet\nProfessor Oak...
May I please have your phone number?\cWe should chat about Professor\nOak. It will be loads of fun! [VAR 0200(0000)]
Huh?\nWait, aren't you nearby?\rDo you like the phone that much?
I recently began observing wild\n[VAR 0100(000A,0000)].\cI've been learning all sorts of new\nthings through my observations.\cI wish I could become a Pokémon\nresearcher like Professor Oak soon.\cSee you later!
Oh yes, I managed to knock out a wild\n[VAR 0100(000B,0000)] a while back.\cWell, considering all the Pokémon\nstudying I do every day,\rit was inevitable.\cSee you later!
Oh yes, I came close to catching\na wild [VAR 0100(000B,0000)], but it got away.\cFor the longest time, I've been wanting\nto observe [VAR 0100(000B,0000)]. Man...\cSee you later!\n
Do you know Blue?\cHe's Professor Oak's grandson and a\nformer Pokémon League Champion!\rHe's one super Pokémon Trainer!\cSee you later!
Professor Oak has a granddaughter\nnamed Daisy.\cWhen she's around, even the most\nferocious Pokémon calm right down.\cSee you later!
Everyone's talking about\nProfessor Elm.\cHe used to be an assistant to the great\nProfessor Oak!\cThat is so cool! I envy him!\cSee you later!
Professor Oak's dream is to compile a\ncomprehensive Pokédex.\cI envy you for taking part in that\nproject...\cSee you later!
Do you know Kurt, the Poké Ball\ncreator?\cHe and Professor Oak go back a long\nway. I guess great people attract\rone another!\cSee you later!
The Pokémon League is the great\ngathering place for all Trainers who\rwish to become the Champion.\cProfessor Oak acts as an advisor to\nthe Pokémon League's headquarters.\cHe really is a great man.\cSee you later!
Professor Oak's Pokémon Talk is a\npopular radio show, right?\cDid you know that he was going to turn\ndown the show at first?\cBut Mary's energy and persistence wore\nhim down.\rSo we have Mary to thank for it!\cSee you later!
Professor Oak used to be a Trainer a\nlong time ago.\cBut rather than battling, he found\nPokémon themselves to be interesting.\cSo he abandoned his training to focus\non becoming a researcher.\cSee you later!
Professor Oak has a granddaughter\nnamed Daisy.\cShe has tea every day for an hour from\nthree in the afternoon.\cI wish I could join her for tea and chat\nabout Professor Oak.\cSee you later!

I'd love to do some more battle\npreparation and review with you...\cThat's it!\nHow about exchanging phone numbers\rwith me? [VAR 0200(0000)]
All right, I'm looking forward to talking\nto you again. I'll be sure to give you a\rcall if anything comes up!
Hey, you should listen when Teachers\nare talking to you!
Did you change your mind about\nexchanging phone numbers? [VAR 0200(0000)]
You know, I'm pretty sure I just\ncaught a glimpse of you...\cIf you're nearby, you shouldn't talk\nover the phone. You should talk\rto me in person.
Hey!\cYou got yet another zero on a test!\nYou don't pay attention to anything\rI'm saying in class, do you?\rDo you honestly think you can beat a\rGym Leader with that kind of...\cHuh?\cYou're not Travis...\cOh my goodness! I'm so sorry!
You know, I usually use [VAR 0100(000A,0000)].\cDon't you enjoy battling using your\nbest-loved Pokémon?\cBut it gets kind of lonely to just keep\nusing the same Pokémon over and over.\cSometimes I like to walk along with\nPokémon that I've just caught.\cThat can also be a lot of fun, you know?
The other day, I was battling\n[VAR 0100(000B,0000)] on Route 15. People\rstopped to watch, and soon there was\rthis huge crowd gathered!\rI got so nervous...\cYou know, I'm used to talking in front\nof a class of kids...\rbut Pokémon battles are something else.\cI just can't get comfortable battling in\nfront of a crowd!
You know...\nThis is just between us, right?\cThe other day, I was trying to catch a\n[VAR 0100(000B,0000)].\cI made a mistake and accidentally\nthrew out the wrong Poké Ball, and the\rPokémon got away.\cIt's a good thing none of my students\nwere watching. But still, I was really\rembarrassed.
By the way, you'd like to prepare for\nPokémon battles and do some review,\rwouldn't you?\cWe should have another Pokémon battle!\cI'm always on [VAR 0104(0003,0000)].\nI'll be waiting for you there!
Hey! Do you remember you made plans\nwith me?\cWe said we were going to meet on\n[VAR 0104(0003,0000)] and have a Pokémon\rbattle, right? Don't forget!
That's right... If you ask me which is\ncuter, my students or Pokémon,\rI'll have a hard time making\rthat decision.\cCome to think of it, for a lot of kids,\ntheir first Pokémon is the cutest one in\rthe world in their young eyes.\cAnd there's nothing that can be said to\nchange that opinion.

I'd like to have another Pokémon battle\nwith you sometime. Can we trade\rphone numbers? [VAR 0200(0000)]
Hey! Thanks!
Hey! Oh well!
I'd like to have another Pokémon battle\nwith you sometime. Can we trade\rphone numbers? [VAR 0200(0000)]
Even though you're nearby, talking on\nthe phone makes you seem far away.\cDon't be shy. Why not come talk\nto me in person?
There are some people out there who\nsay, “You don't need to give Bait to\ryour caught Pokémon,” but\rI'm different.\cMy [VAR 0100(000A,0000)] does a great job.\cSo I feed it delicious things, brush it,\npet it, show it affection, and just\rcherish it!
Yesterday I went fishing and knocked\nout a [VAR 0100(000B,0000)]!\cI know that if I go to the mountains, or\nthe forest, or the grassland, or the\rcaves, or any place like that,\rI could find all kinds of Pokémon.\cBut I just really like Pokémon like\n[VAR 0100(000B,0000)], you know...
The biggest Pokémon is always the one\nyou almost caught, you know?\cJust the other day, I had almost\ncaught a [VAR 0100(000B,0000)] when it\rran away! I was so disappointed!\cWhen you're fishing, don't have any\nregrets! Fish with all your might!\rHey! Fight!
I'm getting sick of fishing. I'd rather\nhave a Pokémon battle with you!\cHey! I'm waiting on [VAR 0104(0003,0000)].
Hello? We made plans to meet on\n[VAR 0104(0003,0000)] for a battle, right?\rHey! Hurry up and get here.
The real draw of fishing is that you\nnever know what you'll catch until you\ractually pull it up out of the water.\cSomeday maybe I'll pull up on the\nfishing Rod and there will be a\rlegendary Pokémon on the other end of\rmy line...\cYeah, right. The chances of that\nhappening are basically zero.\cFor example, RAIKOU and the others, as\nthey're skipping around all over the\rplace, maybe their feet would slip and\rthey'd land in the sea...\cWhat do you think, could I accidentally\ncatch RAIKOU while fishing?\c...How silly, right?

A while back, I tried to catch a wild\n[VAR 0100(000B,0000)].\cIt managed to elude me.\cOne wrong decision could mean total\nfailure... You ought to be careful, too.
I managed to barely defeat\n[VAR 0100(000B,0000)] the other day.\cI've never seen a wild [VAR 0100(000B,0000)]\nget that strong...\cYou shouldn't let your guard down, even\nagainst a Pokémon you're used\rto seeing.
Let's battle!\cI'll be waiting on [VAR 0104(0003,0000)].\nGive me a shout when you're close.
[VAR 0103(0000,0000)], why aren't you here?\cI'll take you down on\n[VAR 0104(0003,0000)]!

Our battle was remarkable!\cI wish for something to remember\nyou by!\cPerhaps your phone number will do?\cMy training makes it impossible to\nchat much, but... [VAR 0200(0000)]
I must train harder to become\nthe mightiest!
If you decide you want my number, come\nand find me.
My training makes chatting tough.\nSo, take down my number? [VAR 0200(0000)]
Today, I'd like to thank you,\n[VAR 0103(0000,0000)]!\cI've been training all alone...\nI was happy that you cared to call...\c[VAR 0103(0000,0000)]! I want you to have this!\c
Your strength will not let you carry\nanother thing! I will hold this till you\rlighten your Bag!
Excuse me?\nIf you're nearby, then I'd appreciate\rthe politeness of talking face-to-face!
Are you still on your journey?\nI remain dedicated to my training.\rOooooaaarrrgh!
My apologies, but I don't have time to\nchat while I am in training!\cI'll have time to chat tomorrow!\nYiiihah!
I plan to take a lunch break, so come\nand visit with me then!\rAyiiiyah!
I'm taking a break on Route 45!\nWhy not drop by? We can have a battle!
I rested up over my lunch break.\nNow, it's time to resume training!\rOooryaah!

Hey, how about we exchange phone\nnumbers before we eat?[VAR 0200(0000)]
I've always got my Pokégear in reach,\nso if you give me a call, I'll answer\rpretty quick!\n
Don't worry!\cI'm a really nice Camper...
Did you decide you'd like to trade\nnumbers with me after all?[VAR 0200(0000)]
Yeah! Hey, here you are!\cI've been holding on to this just for\nyou. Don't be shy--go ahead and\rtake it. It's a present!\c
Hm? Oh, you're just around the corner?\cIf you're that close, why bother with\na phone call? Humph!
You know, it's perfectly fine to be all\naffectionate to your Pokémon and let\rthem live in your house.\cBut I prefer to go out camping with my\nconstant companion, [VAR 0100(000A,0000)],\rwhich is why it's so strong!\cThat reminds me--we knocked out a wild\n[VAR 0100(000B,0000)], whammo! Just like that,\rthe other day. You should've seen it...
About all this training your Pokémon\njust so you can catch stronger\rwild Pokémon...\cIt's not a good idea to be throwing\nPoké Balls around recklessly, trying to\rcatch any old thing.\cYou need to build up a close connection\nwith your Pokémon.\cMy relationship with my [VAR 0100(000A,0000)] is\na perfect example.\c...Well, I say that, but the other day\nwe had a wild [VAR 0100(000B,0000)] just barely\rget away from us.\cNo matter how much I'd rather not think\nabout it, I can't let the thoughts go...
Hear me out! Earlier, we met a wild\n[VAR 0100(000B,0000)]!\cIt kind of jumped out as we were on the\nway home from a camping excursion!\rI was so surprised!\cI guess it goes to show you shouldn't\nlet your guard down when you're out\rin nature!
I was getting ready to cook up some\nchow, and I started thinking about you.\cBefore I sit down to eat, would you like\nto battle again?\cI'm on [VAR 0104(0003,0000)], so bring your\nbest Pokémon!
Huh? What's going on? Did you get lost\nor something?\cStay calm... I am right smack on\n[VAR 0104(0003,0000)], so you should\rhave no trouble finding me!
Do you know the difference between\ngoing on a picnic and camping?\cIt's a song, of course!\cWhen you're going on a picnic, you sing a\nhappy, upbeat little tune as you hike\rover hills and fields.\cWhen you're camping, you sing quiet,\nmournful songs of grief and loss while\rsitting and staring at the campfire.\cWhat? You don't believe me?\cThen we should go camping sometime\nand sit around the fire and see what\rkind of melodies you feel like singing!
Recently, I was digging a fire pit in the\nground so I could cook supper, and\rI found an unusual item!\cApparently this thing is called a\nSun Stone.\cI'll give it to you. I'm waiting on\n[VAR 0104(0003,0000)]!
I still have that Sun Stone I said I'd\ngive you!\cI'm waiting on [VAR 0104(0003,0000)], so\ncome and get it as soon as you can!

Sheesh, the way you attacked! That was\nsomething else! We should meet again!\cHow about giving me your number?[VAR 0200(0000)]

No? That's fine.\nA definite no is easy to take!\cI'll be right here when you're ready for\na rematch.
So you want to register my phone\nnumber for a rematch, huh?[VAR 0200(0000)]
Well, you are special, all right.\cIf only I'd begun training Pokémon when\nI was a tad younger...\cI want you to work hard and succeed\nfor both of us.\rSo, take this, OK?\c
Uh-huh?\nIs that a river I hear in the\rbackground? You're nearby!
Nothing can match my [VAR 0100(000A,0000)] now.\cYeah, we KO'd a wild [VAR 0100(000B,0000)]!\cThat was OK, but what I wanted was\nto catch it...\cOK, give me a call again!
Nothing can match my [VAR 0100(000A,0000)] now.\cAnd, yesterday, we spotted a wild\n[VAR 0100(000B,0000)].\cWe were debating whether to catch\nit or just gain experience battling it.\cThen, along came another guy,\nwho caught it! How about that!\cOK, give me a call again!
You're thinking you'd like to battle me.\nAm I right or what?\cYep! We'll meet on [VAR 0104(0003,0000)]!
Haven't you gone as far as\n[VAR 0104(0003,0000)]?\cWaiting here is no problem,\nbut I'd sure like to battle!
You'll battle with me again, right?

Wah ha ha! [VAR 0103(0000,0000)]!\nHere's that Dawn Stone you wanted.\cHere you go.\c...And now that you've got what you\ncame here for, SCRAM!\c
It's dangerous to talk on the phone\nwhile riding on Cycling Road, but\rsometimes I've got no choice!\cIf you're nearby, let's talk in person!

My [VAR 0100(000A,0000)] has gotten\nawesomely strong!\cWe can go catch [VAR 0100(000B,0000)] now!

You...\nYou've got a Pokémon with you, right?\cThat's...\nThat's pretty sweet, isn't it?\cIf you were blazing up and down the\nroad as fast as you could, like me, you\rwouldn't be able to have your Pokémon\ralongside you.\cMakes me a bit jealous of you, to tell\nthe truth.
Hey! I picked up something great!\cI checked it with someone who knows\nthis stuff. They said it's a Dawn Stone.\cIf you want it, I'm on\n[VAR 0104(0003,0000)], so come and get it!

Mostly I breathe fire, but want\nto exchange phone numbers? [VAR 0200(0000)]
All right!\cDon't worry. I'll stop breathing fire\nwhile we're talking on the phone...\rso give me a call sometime!
I knew that us Firebreathers weren't\nparticularly well liked...
Oh!\nWould you like to breathe fire with me?\c...Oh, you don't.\cWould you like to exchange phone\nnumbers with me after all? [VAR 0200(0000)]
It's all right.\nI promise I won't burn you, so you can\rcome talk to me in person.
You know, a lot of people\nmisunderstand.\cIt may seem like we Firebreathers use\nfire to threaten our Pokémon while\rtraining them.\cBut that's not the case at all!\nWe just train our Pokémon normally!\rIsn't that right, [VAR 0100(000A,0000)]?\cBreathing fire is just a hobby!
Buoahhhbobobo!\cWhat do you think?\nI discovered a new technique\rfor breathing fire!\cWell, not like you can tell over\nthe phone...\cNever mind that. I caught a wild\n[VAR 0100(000B,0000)] yesterday.\cI think I'll start training it soon.
Do you like [VAR 0100(000B,0000)]?\cAs for me...they're all right. There's\nall kinds of things in this world.
Buoahhhbobobo!\nToday is a great day!\cYou should have another battle with me!\nI'm waiting and practicing on\r[VAR 0104(0003,0000)]!

You know how there are so many\ndifferent types of Pokémon, right?\cEach type has good points and bad\npoints, so it's not easy to say which\rtype is the best.\cHowever...\cMy choice has to be the Fire type!\rBuoahhhbobobo!!

By the way, I'm a Hiker, so I often go\nto mountains and caves.\cI don't usually go to the town.\cI bet you go to all kinds of towns on\nyour journey, don't you?\cYou know, if we were to trade phone\nnumbers, then we could exchange\rall kinds of information, yes? [VAR 0200(0000)]
I'll give you a call when I think of a\ngood, heart-warming story, OK?
That's so sad. I might just end up\nsecluding myself in the mountain...
What do you say?\nWould you like to exchange numbers\rwith another adventurer? [VAR 0200(0000)]
You're nearby, and yet you're going to\ncall me on the phone?\cAm I that “dazzling” that you need to\nkeep your distance?
The other day, I was watching my\n[VAR 0100(000A,0000)] eat some Berries.\rIt looked like it was enjoying its meal,\rso I decided to try some.\cI'm not sure if people should eat that\nstuff, but it was delicious!\cAll right then!\nBe good!
Lately, I've been running across wild\n[VAR 0100(000B,0000)] quite often.\rThey're easily taken care of.\cAll right then!\nBe good!

Hello! You haven't forgotten about our\nbattle, have you?\c[VAR 0104(0003,0000)]! I'm waiting!

Here I come!
Yeah!\c
Bleah!\c
Hey, rookie!\nBring it on!
Yeah, I knew it.\nYou're a rookie after all.\c
Bleah!\nYou're just a rookie!\c
I gotta say it, shorts are the best!\nThey remain comfy and easy to wear!
Shorts are the greatest!\c
I'll never stop wearing shorts.\nNot for anybody!\c
I make it a policy to wear\nminiskirts!
Miniskirts are the ultimate!\c
What's your policy?\c
I love my miniskirt!
Caught you snoozing!\c
Miniskirts make legs look longer!\nIs that a good thing?\c
I'm on the lookout for adorable\nAccessories.
Let me know if you find any nice\nAccessories!\c
I wish I could dress up!\c
I want to test out something I\nlearned at private school.
Yes!\nIt worked perfectly!\c
Hmm...\nSomething's wrong here.\c
Uh... Wroar!
A battle is about momentum and\nwillpower.\c
OK, so willpower doesn't cut it on\nits own.\c
I study every day because I want to\nwork all over the world.
My dream is worldwide!\c
I need to study up on Pokémon\nbattles.\c
When I grow up, I'm going to be a\nPokémon professor!
Er-hem! Er-hem!\nYou've much to learn, youngster!\c
Er-hem! Er-hem!\nSeems I've much to learn still!\c
When the subject is Pokémon, I simply\ndon't lose!
It's a victory of knowledge!\c
I'm going to review the subject!\nAnd I'll subject you to my revenge!\c
Oh, now you look wimpy.\nI might win this.
I so did it!\c
Ouch, that hurt.\c
It's fine, fine.\nNo need to say a word.
It's fine, fine.\nYou tried your best, I know.\c
It's fine, fine...\nNo need to say a word...\c
I'm rich!
Well, of course.\nI'm rich.\c
What happened?\nI'm rich, aren't I?\c
Hmm. So, you're good, huh?
Hmm. You're no big deal.\nHmm?\c
Hmm. So, you are good.\nHmm.\c
Oh, yes.\nI shall attack now.
I've done it!\c
Oh, how disappointing.\c
Over it is, your adventure.\nCome hither and get whupped!
A done deal, it was.\c
Oh, how vexing this so is.\nVerily, I thank you.\c
How boring...
So truly boring...\c
That was a good way to waste some\ntime.\c
Hunh?\nWhere is everyone?
Hey, guys!\nWhere are you?!\c
I came to camp, but I think I got\nseparated from my friends...\c
Oh!\nDon't you have a Pokétch, too?
I was fooling around with my\nPokétch, but I still won!\c
I was fooling around with my\nPokétch, and I lost...\c
My Pokémon trained in forests.
It's the power of the forests.\c
I'm going back to the forest.\c
I'll battle you like I'm on a picnic!
Lalala!\c
Pretending this is a picnic won't let\nme win.\c
Ooh-la-la!\nHere we come!
Ooh-la-la!\nSo happy I won!\c
Ooh-la-la!\nEven losing can't dampen my spirits!\c
I'll teach you what's fun about\nbattling.
Battling me was fun, wasn't it?\c
Oh, my, that was inspiring!\nYou're the greatest!\c
I... I can swim, really!\nI don't need my inflatable tube!
It... It's true!\c
I... I'm not lying!\c
I like rivers more than the sea.\nWhich do you prefer?
Water in rivers is cold, but it feels\njust super.\c
I don't like the sea because the\nsalty water burns my eyes!\c
Go, go, go!\nGo, my Pokémon!
That's the way!\nWay to go, my Pokémon!\c
Good effort!\nWay to go, my Pokémon!\c
The beach sand is so hot! It makes\nme go, “Ouch, ouch, ouch!”
I love the sea!\c
Ouch, ouch, ouch!\c
Splish, splash!
Ker-splash!\nKer-splash!\c
Flip, flop!\c
I'm a girl in love with her inflatable\ntube! Nice to meet you!
Thank you! I'm a girl in love with\nher inflatable tube!\c
Good-bye! I'm a girl in love with her\ninflatable tube!\c
Oh, yeah! I'm feeling it!\nI'm tuned in to your wavelength!
Tadaaaah!\c
Tch!\nLosing threw off my rhythm!\c
Rock? Jazz? Techno?\nAnything'll do for my sound track!
Squeeeeeal!\c
So, yeah... You've got me in the\nmood for singing the blues...\c
Let's get this session on!
You're obviously short on practice.\c
My dream of a world tour...\nIt seems so far away...\c
Oh, hello...\nWell, isn't that a chic scarf!
Where did you buy that scarf?\c
Oh, you! You're not just fashionable,\nyou're good with Pokémon! How unfair!\c
Thanks for supporting me!
Oh?\nYou're not my fan?\c
What a horrible way to treat\nan Idol...\c
La, lala, lah.
La lalala.\nLalalah lah.\c
Bye-bye, lalah!\c
Let's see who loves Pokémon more,\nyou or me.
Fuhaha! Looks like my love for\nPokémon trumped yours!\c
Grr... Your love of Pokémon is\nstronger than mine?\c
I tell ya, my Pokémon are some kind\nof tough.
You don't want to underestimate me.\c
You're some kind of mighty.\c
OK, show me your favorite Pokémon.\nDon't be shy now, come on.
I see...\nCute, but on the weak side.\c
I see!\nCute, and yet tough.\c
My Pokémon are cute, but they're\nnot very tough!
Oh?\nWe won? Seriously?\c
It's OK. I like my Pokémon.\nThat's all that matters.\c
I've been pampering my gang too\nmuch lately. Can they do it?
Ooh, they did it!\nI knew I could count on my gang!\c
Pampering Pokémon too much is\nno good...\c
Won't you join our Pokémon Fan\nClub?
There's all sorts of fun things to\ndo if you join!\c
Join us!\nBecome a Pokéfan like me!\c
May I take your order, please?
Ah, a fine choice.\nOne loss served fresh.\c
Ah, an excellent choice.\nA win served fresh.\c
What I really hoped to become\nwas a cook.
I don't mind this job now, mind you.\c
I just find it hard talking to\nstrangers.\c
For battles and order taking, speed\nis essential!
Like, chop-chop!\nYou got served.\c
Food is like battling.\nServe it while it's hot!\c
My job is about serving others.\nBut don't expect me to serve here.
Mufufu.\c
Why couldn't you serve me?\nYou won't make friends that way!\c
Isn't this cute?\nMy uniform.
It's my favorite!\c
You messed up my uniform!\c
You're good, aren't you?
Oops.\nI'm a little disappointed.\c
I knew you were a tough Trainer.\c
I catch and raise all sorts of\nPokémon.
See?\nI've raised them pretty good.\c
I need to raise my Pokémon some\nmore!\c
I'll snag you with my net!
It's in the bag!\c
Hey!\nDon't run away!\c
Where can I find a giant HERACROSS?
I want a huge HERACROSS.\nLike, king size!\c
If only I had a giant HERACROSS...\c
Prepare to lose!
The enemy is mine!\c
I lie shattered...\c
Behold my fearsome ninja technique!
Hahah!\nYou saw it!\c
You didn't fall for my fake ninja\nboasting!\c
I shall become a real ninja when\nI grow up!
Excellent! Excellent!\c
So, what's a real ninja supposed to\ndo?\c
Should I torment you?
Yay! Yay!\c
No!\nNo tormenting me!\c
My mommy made this outfit for me.
Isn't it cute?\c
My mommy is really good at sewing.\c
Let's do our best, everyone!
Thanks, everyone!\c
Waaaaah!\c
Sure, we're going to battle, but\ndon't be over the top about it.
Hey, relax, relax.\nIt's best to be natural, dig?\c
You have to loosen up some more.\c
Fish, fish, fish, that's what I do!\nI'm gonna fish it all up!
Kahahah!\nI am at the top of my game!\c
Oh, waah!\nI let that get away!\c
Exploring for relics isn't all fun\nand games!
Your skill level says you probably\nwon't make a good Ruin Maniac.\c
Danger lurks everywhere in ruins!\c
These mates of mine traveled the\nworld with me!
What do you say?\nPretty tough, right?\c
Maybe it's time we hit the\nroad again...\c
Hey, there! Check this out!\nMy rare Pokémon!
Not just rare, either.\nMy Pokémon are tough, too!\c
Aiyah! Hey! Wait!\nNo! Stop! Don't touch!\c
Now just be patient.\nI'll show you my private collection!
See, see? Weren't they awesome?\nThey're the most super of the uber!\c
Awawawah... My...\nMy Pokémon...\c
Look! This is my favorite parasol!\nOh, and my fabulous Pokémon!
Aren't they both cute?\c
I'm only showing you!\nYou can't have any!\c
Have you ever seen a rainbow?
Have you wondered what lies beyond\na rainbow?\c
Seeing a rainbow makes me think good\nthings are in store.\c
If you were the weather, what\nwould you be now?
Right now, I'm feeling sunny\nwithout a cloud in the sky!\c
I'm feeling fogbound...\c
I really don't like weak Trainers!
You don't inspire much trust...\c
A Pokémon Trainer should be tough\nand bursting with life!\c
Lately, I've had a lot to\nworry about...
Winning makes all my worries\nseem trivial!\c
You just added to my worries...\c
This may hurt a little bit, but we'll\nbe done quick. Hold still!
There! Done!\c
Ooh, no!\nThat hurts!\c
Sniff... Sniffle...
Sniffle... Snuffle...\nI think I have a cold...\c
Sniff... Sniffle...\nMy nose is clogging up...\c
Sniff...
Now what could this aroma be?\c
Do you have some cologne on?\nYou smell sort of nice!\c
You're going to lose, but you'll get\nto enjoy a nice aroma!
Kyahaha! That's what you get for\nswooning to my aroma!\c
Kiiiih!\nI am so angry!\c
Let my guitar howl!\nHear me scream!
Yeahey!\c
Giyaaaah!\c
You should channel your feelings into\nsongs with sincerity, man.
The way I feel now?\nIt's rock!\c
The way I feel now is kind of folksy.\c
Now hear me!\nThe Bird Keeper's credo number one!
Soar high on a win!\c
Rest your wings on a loss!\c
Let's both do our best!
Yup, we both did the best we could!\c
Good going!\c
Fly, fly, fly!\nWe're going to rule this battle!
Zoom!\c
We're gonna crash!\c
I'm the Sailor among Sailors!\nI was born on the high seas!
The waves rocked me to sleep!\nThe sea was my mother!\c
Urp... Gweh... So, when I get up on\nland, I get no-motion sickness...\c
I love the sea after all...
Oh... I hear them...\nI hear the sound of waves...\c
I want to become a big man.\nBig like the sea big.\c
Yahoo!
Come on!\nYou holler too!\c
Gweff! Hack! Hack!\nHollering choked me up!\c
You should aspire to the Hiker's\nway of life!
You see?\nYou love my lifestyle, don't you?\c
Now, come on now!\nYou should look up to the way I live!\c
My Pokémon and I are Idols!
Say what you will!\nWe're Idols!\c
We have you beat when it comes down\nto popularity...\c
Watch me!\nAll eyes on me!
Ooh...\nThis is what I live for...\c
I became an Idol because I wanted\neveryone to see me!\c
I'm too into battling...\nThey might fire me as an Idol...
Battling is too much fun!\c
I can't help myself.\nNo one can keep me from battling.\c
I run a marathon every morning!\nIt's great!
My buff physique makes for\neasy wins!\c
So I lost!\nI can still run great marathons!\c
I'll run on the spot while battling\nfor the good of my health.
Let's hear it for good health!\c
Gasp!\nMy ankle! I rolled my ankle!\c
Out of the way!\nI've got deliveries to make!
What? You want me to deliver you\nsomewhere, too?\c
All the delivering I do every day...\nI've got deep muscle pain!\c
It was me who put up the buildings\naround these parts.
So, what do you think?\nCool stuff, huh?\c
My dream is to make a building taller\nthan a mountain!\c
Smell that? That's the smell of hay\nclinging to my body.
Whoa!\c
This smell I have is the sweet scent\nof hay that Pokémon surely love.\c
All right, take a run at me!\nMy barrel chest can take it!
What? That's all you've got?\nYou can take a harder run at me!\c
Ooh... Ow... That hurt... It's like\nyou broke my barrel chest...\c
I'm not getting any younger.\nI can't overexert myself.
What I lack in youth, I make up for\nin experience.\c
Oh, you're good and young.\nThere's a sparkle about you.\c
Hey! You there, Trainer!\nYou and me, we're battling!
Owned!\c
Unbelievable!\c
These here are my Pokémon.\nI raised them with my ma and pa.
Sure right kind of tough, aren't\nthey?\c
Well, I'll be!\nWe lost that one!\c
I'm going to do my level best.\nYou'd better keep up!
Whew! We sure did our best!\c
Yup! We tried hard, y'all!\c
OK, everyone!\nBig smiles!
Big smiles!\nCome on!\c
That's a great smile! Your victory\npose is picture perfect, too!\c
Zoom in on you!
Spot-on focus!\c
Zoom out, fade...\c
This camera is pretty hefty, actually.
My shoulder is always rock stiff...\nMy camera's toughened me up.\c
Oof...\nI'm feeling groggy...\c
Hello there, Trainer!\nPlease battle with me!
Thanks for your help!\c
I appreciate the lesson!\c
I'll do anything for a good\nnews story!
I'm relentless about battling, too!\c
Stop! Please, stop!\nYou'll break my mic!\c
So, the question is, what is your\nopinion of me?
“What a tough Trainer!” Is that\nwhat you're thinking?\c
I'm doing a live report on the topic\nof myself!\c
Come on!\nWe'll run! Together!
Gooooooooaaaaal!\c
Wait!\nDon't leave me behind!\c
Gear change!\nWe're attacking at top speed!
Vrooooom!\c
Kaboom!\c
Can you keep up with my Pokémon at\na full run?
Too slow!\c
I'm taking it to a zone beyond\nspeed!\c
I'd rather cycle casually than go\nfull speed.
Let's take it easy.\c
You ought to take things more\ncasually...\c
I only know how to go at full power,\neven against a younger opponent!
Full power is how I win!\c
Please! Let me call you Master\nTrainer from now on!\c
My spirit burns, my fists are steel,\nand my sweat cascades!
Hrrumph!\c
I sweated more. That makes\nme the victor!\c
En garde!
I'm still ready for more.\c
Urgh... Don't you forget this!\c
Hey! Come on!
Nice fight!\c
You're not bad, you.\c
The ultimate of my techniques!\nExperience it in its entirety!
I am the greatest!\nGwahahaha!\c
I've fallen in defeat?\nGw-gwaaah!\c
Hi! Little kid!\nA battle, please!
Little kid!\nThank you very kindly!\c
Little kid!\nI'm really upset over this!\c
I, um... I've never actually learned\nhow to do karate.
You're kidding?!\nI'm naturally talented?!\c
A Black Belt is cool, huh?\nSo I just dress up like one.\c
It's been five years since I took to\nthe mountains. My hair's grown wild!
I bathe every day!\nHow dare you?\c
Another five years...?\c
Did I catch you smirking at my\neight-pack abs?
You don't appreciate the beauty of\npure muscles!\c
Musculature is the ultimate beauty!\c
In love and in battles, I've never\ntasted defeat!
See? We won again!\c
So, I lost. I don't care!\nI have a date soon, so I don't care!\c
This is it! Over the top!\nEveryone charge!
The enemy Trainer has fallen!\nVictory is ours!\c
Retreat!\nSound the retreat!\c
My career as a Trainer dates back\n75 years. You think you can win?
Here's a toast to my history!\c
My history of glory...\c
Are you prepared?
Ah, a superb battle that was.\c
I tip my hat to you.\c
Oh, my...\nSuch an adorable Trainer...
Are we disappointed?\nHow adorable...\c
I see...\nYou're more than simply adorable.\c
Eee-yeah!
A stirring shout, wouldn't you say?\nI find it quite bracing.
Gasp... Gasp...\nOh, dear... I'm worn out.\c
Being rich doesn't shield me from\nhaving worries...
Of course, being well off is much\npreferable to poverty, but...\c
Lavish parties day after day...\nIt gets rather tiresome, I must say.\c
Come to know defeat...\nLearn what it means to battle...
I see you becoming ever more\npowerful...\c
The defeated merely slink away...\c
Look into my eyes!
You fell under my spell!\c
My power of suggestion failed to\ncharm you!\c
...
...Did it.\c
I focused my mind in silence...\c
My powers!\nThere's no trickery about them!
This is psychic power!\c
There really is no trickery...\c
Take it all!
Ahaha!\c
Gah!\c
Close your eyes and count...\nSlow... Slower...
That was the countdown to my\nvictory!\c
Tch...\nI thought I could lull you to sleep.\c
I live among Pokémon.
I've never been much of a battler,\nbut...\c
I'm just not much of a battler.\c
...They're Pokémon I've raised with\nmy father...
...Dad, are you seeing this?\nI did it...\c
Dad, I can't...\nI need to raise them some more...\c
Raising Pokémon takes a lot of\nhonest effort!
Yahaha! I've had a hands-on time\nraising those Pokémon!\c
Urgwah!\nLook what you've done to my Pokémon!\c
Will you have a look at the Pokémon\nI've raised?
Well?\nCute, aren't they?\c
Cut a girl some slack!\c
I specialize in raising cute Pokémon!
Cute, yet strong! Right?\c
Oh, but they're so cute!\c
Nice to meet you!\nUnderestimate me at your peril!
Told you!\c
I guess I underestimated you...\c
Hmhm... I must say I like the look\nin your eyes.
Your eyes remain unclouded in defeat.\nLike jewels they are!\c
Your eyes shine brighter than any\nbig gemstone I keep at home!\c
When I was your age, I was quite\nthe daredevil, I must say.
Seeing you reminds me of my own\nwild youth.\c
I daresay, you're quite the\ndaredevil yourself!\c
If you want to run home to mommy,\nhere's your chance, punk!
Geheheh!\c
Waah!\nI want my mommy!\c
Battles achieve nothing!\nTake my hand! It's about love!
I didn't mean to battle--but take my\nhand! It's about love!\c
Battling is futile!\nTake my hand! It's about love!\c
I dropped my glasses.\nI can't see straight.
I guess I won.\nI can't see enough to tell.\c
I guess I lost.\nI can't see enough to tell.\c
Steadily and surely.\nYou build from the little things up.
Steadily and surely is how I won!\c
But I did things steadily and\nsurely...\c
Hehehehe...
Gehahahaha!\c
Sob, sob, sob...\c
Everybody gather around for my\nstupendicular Pokémon show!
Wasn't that amusing?\c
Nrrgh...\nI am not amused.\c
I shall train with you.
Show some spine!\nOn your feet!\c
Fine!\nThat will do!\c
Why get all intellectual about things?\nIf it's fun, why question it?
See, I can still win.\nI don't see a problem!\c
So I lost!\nIf it's fun, it's cool!\c
I expect you to be good...\nDon't you disappoint me!
My hope was misplaced...\c
You've got good things.\c
My papa and mama are high-skill\nTrainers, too.
It's in my lineage!\c
Papa, Mama!\nI'm so sorry!\c
I go all out in battle, no matter\nwhat.
The inevitable conclusion!\c
I concede!\c
This is it! The biggest battle in my\nlife! I cannot afford to lose!
Woot, yeah!\c
This sets me back to being a Lass...\c
My love of nature and Pokémon made\na Ranger out of me!
I love to battle, too!\c
Ooh...\nI still love to battle, too.\c
Hi! Have you ever considered a\ncareer as a Ranger?
Well, you might not make it at your\nskill level.\c
Yes, you've got the mettle.\nBeing a Ranger is a lot of fun!\c
Win or lose, a battle happens only\nonce!
Do you have any regrets?\c
I have no regrets!\c
It's my sworn duty to protect nature\nand the Pokémon in it.
It's a challenging life, but there's\na lot to enjoy every day.\c
It's a rewarding career.\nHow does it sound to you?\c
My darling Pokémon will lay a licking\non you!
Well? Satisfied?\c
Well, aren't you tough?\nI'm a little stunned!\c
I didn't sleep while trying to come\nup with this new strategy!
My strategy worked!\c
Oh, but...\nI really needed to sleep tonight...\c
The credo of the Dragon Tamer!\nNumber one!
In victory, roar!\nRoar with your dragon!\c
Even in defeat, roar!\nRoar with your dragon!\c
Mighty! Like a dragon!
Strong, I am!\c
...Urf...\nI wanted to be strong...\c
See it! Feel it!\nThe ultimate power... Probably!
There is no defeat for me, the\nultimate... Probably!\c
The title of the ultimate probably!\nI confer it on you!\c
Oh, wow!\nRare Pokémon!
Hihihi... That's what you get for\nletting down your guard.\c
Tch.\nCouldn't fool you.\c
I can't stand getting cold, but I'm\nquite good.
Ch-chatter...\nWa-wahaha. I won, I won!\c
Ch-chatter... Urr...\nI'm getting sleepy...\c
My ace Pokémon are on the go!
You surprise me!\nNot too shabby!\c
I like the sense you show!\c
Snow is wonderful!\nEverything becomes white.
Snow is so romantic!\c
I'm whiting out...\c
Don't you think this coat is cute?\nIt limits my movements, though.
It's toasty warm.\c
I feel snowed under...\c
I'm the one! Number one out of all\nthe kids in shorts!
See? That's what being number one\nis about!\c
Darn...\nI'm number one...\c
I'm the one! The only one true one\namong shorts-wearing kids!
See? That's what being the only one\nis about!\c
Ack...\nI'm the only one...\c
Um...\nI'm pleased to meet you.
Awawa... We won?\nUm? S-sorry.\c
Er, um...\nTh-thank you...\c
Here goes!
Bravo!\c
Yelp!\c
You learn, too!
The harsh realities of battling!\c
The joy of victory!\c
Allow me to study you.
You offered me nothing new to learn.\c
I get it now. In that situation,\nI should have used that move.\c
My teacher gave me advice on\nbattling.
My teacher was right!\nThat was just so easy!\c
Aww, my teacher was wrong!\nNone of it worked!\c
Why are we battling?\nI don't get it.
Why? I don't understand.\c
Why did you win?\nWhat happens now?\c
Ultimately, Pokémon is just another\nbrand. You know who'll win, right?
I'm not interested in what was an\ninevitable result.\c
But how... My...\nThe Pokémon I've raised...\c
There isn't anything that I can't\nbuy. Money can buy battles!
There's nothing that money can't\nbuy.\c
I'll give you my allowance if you'll\nlet me win.\c
You know, I'm really not cut out for\ndoing this socialite-lady thing...
Gahahahah!\c
You swine! Now I'm steamed!\c
I'll be done with you lickety-split!
Lickety-split is how you were done!\c
Lickety-split is how I'll\nexcuse myself!\c
Crunch-crunch...\nCrunch-crunch...
I love these crunchy Lava Cookies...\c
What am I standing on?\nBusted Poké Balls?\c
The way of the Bug Catcher!\nBear witness to it!
This is the way of the Bug Catcher!\c
All hail Bug Catchers!\c
Feast your eyes on secret techniques\nof the ancients!
See? What did you think?\nAre you awestruck?\c
That's my cue to disappear in a puff\nof smoke.\c
I see it!
Think not ill of me...\c
Gyoeeeh!\c
Pikaaa!
Pikapikaaah!\c
Pi pika...\c
A battle, you say?\nI'm never losing to you!
Yeehah! Yippee!\nI won, I won!\c
Urk...\nWe lost...\c
It's my job to be cute!
Just being cute is money in the bank!\c
Ugagaah!\nYou rotten thief!\c
You can shake hands with me!\nIt would be quite the honor for you!
If you'd won, I would have even\ngiven you my autograph!\c
My management team will have\nsomething to say about this!\c
Run!\nDon't think! Run!
Faster!\nMore! More! Faster!\c
Run!\nKeep running for me!\c
Hiya.\nNice to meet ya.
All right.\nNice seeing ya.\c
All right.\nThanks for coming by.\c
My cohorts call me the emperor\nof fishing!
I landed another big one today!\c
Why the emperor of fishing?\nIt's an ancient Chinese legend...\c
When you get as good as me, you can\nwin easily, even if asleep.
Zzz... Zzz...\c
Sssnore...\c
My mom and I travel around in search\nof lost treasures.
The rest of the time, we fish and\ntend to crops every single day.\c
You sure seem to be hectic.\c
Win! That's what I'll do again today!\nI'll win tomorrow, too!
Nahaha! Nahaha!\nI'm not gonna lose my whole life!\c
Nooooo! No way!\nI didn't lose!\c
Allow me to examine your prowess as\na collector.
You're still wanting.\nI urge you to keep at it.\c
That's quite the collection.\nI'm willing to relieve you of the lot.\c
There! There! And there!
Yes, sir!\c
Owowowoooh!\c
I want you to hear it!\nA shout from the heart!
I love music!\c
Let's hear it for an encore!\c
Battle?\nI'm up for that.
Wow.\nGood stuff.\c
Thanks much.\c
Fwoom!
Flap! Flap!\c
I'm gonna pluck you for that!\c
Sure, let's duke it out!
Let's battle again!\c
You're not half bad!\c
Looking out over the sea's breaking\nwaves... It revives memories.
Wroaaaaaar!\nDaddy!\c
Wroaaaar!\nMommy!\c
Come on! Take a run at me!\nI can take it!
So, what'd you think?\nI was too burly for you to handle?\c
Good job!\nWay to overcome my size!\c
Waah! Wait! Wait a second!\nMy mind's not into this yet!
Hunh? It's over already?\nWhat? I won, you say?\c
Huh? Hah? It's over already?\nWhat? I lost, you say?\c
My favorite drink is Moomoo Milk.\nGot some?
Wahaha! I get the win!\nLet's celebrate over some Moomoo Milk!\c
Gwaah! Moomoo Milk!\nBring me some Moomoo Milk!\c
You're under arrest!\nYou're under arrest!
Takedown!\c
Officer down!\c
I'm not a real Policeman.\nI'm a uniform collector.
You look like a uniform will suit you.\nYou should try to find one you like.\c
I must say, battling is a\nwonderful thing.\c
Who knows what happens tomorrow?
You can lose one day, and win the\nnext. That's how it goes.\c
I might win tomorrow.\nThat's what I believe.\c
I'm throwing my all into this match!
Yeah! Yahoo!\c
It's over!\c
The indefatigable Camper makes\nhis stand!
You can become a devotee if\nyou'd like.\c
I wish I could become your devotee.\c
I don't think I have any chance of\nwinning, but sure, I'll battle.
Wow, I wasn't expecting to win.\c
I knew I'd lose.\nI'm so sorry for this.\c
I think you're awfully interested in\nme, aren't you?
You lost because you were paying too\nmuch attention to me.\c
Why did you win?\nI thought you liked me.\c
Win or lose, let's not bear any\ngrudges.
Yay, yay, yay!\nWe did it!\c
Oh, you!\nDon't ever forget this!\c
Pokémon are for adults, too...\nLet me show you...
What do you think?\nAm I deep like an old blues man?\c
Though it cuts me deep, it's a man's\nlot in life to endure the pain...\c
What I have here isn't really a\nguitar.
Beep, boop, bzzt...\c
This here is a keyboard synth.\c
For work, I sometimes get to be a\nSwimmer or a Beauty.
An Idol can become anybody!\c
But the real me...\nI'm still a Lass in a miniskirt!\c
Let's enjoy ourselves.\nI hate anything to do with pain!
Ooh! That was fun!\c
Yowch! Watch it!\nYou play too rough!\c
I'll put an end to this!\nWith my favorite Pokémon!
The love I have for my Pokémon is\ncomplete and perfectly strong...\c
Why? Why?!\nWhy did I lose?!\c
Living with Pokémon...\nEvery day is the greatest.
Ehehe...\nPokémon are the best...\c
It's not a problem if I lose.\nI still have my Pokémon...\c
I have my Pokémon.\nI don't need anything else.
With my Pokémon, I can be happy\nevery day.\c
Isn't that the same for you?\nIsn't it?\c
You won't guess it now, but I was\nquite the party girl in my day.
Well, I still have it now, you know.\c
I feel nostalgic for those days...\c
Do your best!\nMy beloved children!
Wahaha! Well done!\nMama's proud of you!\c
My Pokémon are my beloved family.\c
Little boy? Little girl? Doesn't\nmatter which. Let's do this!
Little boy? Little girl?\nDoesn't matter which, but sorry.\c
Little boy? Little girl? Doesn't\nmatter which, but you're sure tough!\c
Your ride ends here.
Told ya it's over.\c
Too much for me to handle!\c
We're going for the win!\nHey-ho, let's go!
Yay! Vavavoom!\c
Aww, we lost...\nSniffle...\c
Let me introduce to you\nmy cherished partners!
How did you find them?\nMy cherished partners.\c
Awawa...\nMy partners...\c
Winning and losing isn't all there is\nto battling.
Well, sure, it makes me happy when\nI win.\c
The effort you put in is what's\nimportant.\c
It's no good to be too harsh...\nBut pampering is also out...
Being a Pokémon Breeder is a deep\nand complex challenge.\c
Balance is key for raising good\nPokémon.\c
I'll check how your Pokémon have\ngrown for you.
Not good enough!\nYour training style's not up to par.\c
This is impressive! You've raised your\nPokémon really thoroughly.\c
I'll win.\nNo lie.
See?\c
Huh!\c
Fwaah! Fwaah!\nYou think you can beat me?
Fwaah! Fwaah!\nI win!\c
Fwaah!\c
I've caught you now.\nGive up.
You weren't bad.\nLet's meet again.\c
How could this be...?\c
Yo, yo!\nLet's have a fun time!
Thank you!\nLet's play again!\c
Thanks!\nPlay with me again!\c
You're no good at all.\nI'd better teach you.
No, no, this won't do at all.\nUp on your feet. Never give up!\c
You've got good skills.\nYou tried hard, too. Excellent!\c
I'm jacking up the power to max!\nAll the way to eleven!
Ooh, yeah! I'm feeling electric!\c
Eeyow! I got zapped!\c
OK, bring it!
Hah! Too weak!\nKeep trying!\c
Hoh! You are tough!\nGive me a rematch!\c
You need to be serious with me!
Oh? That's it?\c
OK...\nQuite remarkable...\c
Ahaha! Too bad for you!\nI'm your opponent!
Ahaha!\c
Aha...\nAhaha...\c
Are you nervous?\nLeave it to the dude!
That was a good battle.\nI hope we can meet again.\c
Whew...\nThe dude wasn't expecting to lose.\c
The power of nature!\nLet me show you!
This is the power of nature!\c
Protect the natural environment...
A battle with me? I don't know what\nyou're talking about.
See?\nI thought this would happen.\c
Boo! Boo!\nThis is not right!\c
Fuhahaha!\nYour next challenge is me!
Fuhahaha! You seriously believed you\ncould defeat me?\c
Fuhahaha!\nLet us meet again!\c
Off you go! Face my team of totally\ntrained Pokémon!
Bravo!\nI knew my Pokémon would do it!\c
Oh, no! That's awful!\nWhat have you done to my Pokémon?!\c
A battle is deadly earnest!\nNot a moment of inattention!
Never let down your guard!\c
I seemed to have let my\nmind wander...\c
Hey!
Heeey!\c
Hey...\c
I'm tough, that's all.
I won, that's all.\c
I lost, that's all.\c
Shaah!
Hwooh!\c
Hawah!\c
I've been here for years, but I never\nget tired of this.
You might not think so, but I'm still\na kid. I'm in the same grade as you.\c
I'd like to keep battling Pokémon\neven when my hair is gray.\c
Let me make one thing clear...\nYou aren't capable of beating me.
Did I not say? There is no possible\nchance of you beating me.\c
How could this be...? Only that girl with\nthe inflatable tube has beaten me...\c
Oh, my, a mere child.
Children these days...\nSo careless.\c
Children these days...\nQuite exuberant, methinks.\c
I would like my children to become\nstrong and distinguished Trainers.
It wouldn't do if my children were\nonly as good as you...\c
It would be nice if they were as\nskilled as you...\c
Behold you shall!\nPsychic-mystifying power!
You see?\nPsychic-mystifying power!\c
No, but...\nPsychic-mystifying power...\c
My family will show you a good time!
Hold up, my family!\nThat'll be enough already!\c
My beloved family...\c
Twirl, twirl, twirl...
Are you feeling dizzy?\c
Ooorgh...\nMy head's spinning...\c
My big brother told me!\nEyes! Aim for the eyes!
Yay! I did it!\nMy big brother's plan worked!
My big brother told me to lower\nthe foe's accuracy!
Hoy! You look pretty tough.\nThis is gonna be fun!
I thought so!\nYou are tough!\c
Yup, you sure are tough.\nKeep it up!\c
Ah, welcome!\nI'm your server today!
Would you care to settle your bill?\c
Thank you so much!\c
Hello.\nWhatcha having?
Thanks a million!\c
Be seeing ya!\c
I love cute customers like you!\nI'll serve you right!
Well, were you happy with the way\nI served you?\c
Oh, but...\nI'm not done serving you.\c
Stare...
You've got something on your nose.\c
You're cool, all right.\nI had to stare.\c
I've waited a long time for a Trainer\nlike you to come along.
Yup, you're as tough as I thought.\nYou even had me in trouble!\c
I knew it!\nYou are a tough Trainer!\c
Now how should I conduct\nthis offensive?
Oh, now, I need a better effort out\nof you than that.\c
Oh, you're finished and content?\nOK, another time, then.\c
My Pokémon have a different taste\nfrom the usual bunch.
Did you notice the difference?\nMy party has rich depth.\c
Did you notice the difference?\nMy party is refreshingly dry.\c
Hiya!\nTough-looking Trainer, aren't you!
This feeling of elation is bubbling\nup in me!\c
Ooch...\nYou're too much to handle.\c
Varrroooom!\nWatch me go full throttle!
Vavavaroooom!\nI'm not close to redlining!\c
Vrrr... Vrruuu...\nI'm flat out of gas...\c
Jingle, jingle!
Skreeeech!\c
Thud!\c
It's my dream to cycle with my\nboyfriend.
No riding double, though!\c
I wish I had a boyfriend!\c
What's your motive?\nWhat brought you here?
You lose.\nNow what will you do?\c
Play it again.\c
We'll keep this match dry.
I admire your technique.\c
I remain humbled...\c
You're serious? A battle?\nAnd that's against me?
Cackle!\nYou shouldn't have tried!\c
Double wow!\c
I'll dance and sing and rivet\nyour attention!
Ooh, baby!\c
So much for riveting your attention.\nYou nailed my Pokémon!\c
Ready, start!
First across the finish line!\c
Waah! Wait for me!\c
Can you explain why I'm here?
I mean, who are you?\c
Why am I battling here?\c
My fishing-rod-handling technique is\nthe best in all Sinnoh. Check it out!
See it?\nSurprised, I bet!\c
How I handle my fishing rod has\nnothing to do with battling...\c
The two loves of my life are fishing\nand battling.
I feel fantastic when I land a big\nfish or win a big battle.\c
I was born to fish and battle!\c
I come here on a ship.\nBig ship it was.
Sinnoh, I like.\nVery nice place.\c
You want go to sea? My ship, we will\nsee wonderful things.\c
Huh? You're my opponent?\nThis is kind of unnerving...
I'm surprised...\nI didn't think I'd win.\c
See, I told you...\nI thought you were tough.\c
Hahah! Howdy!
Hahah! Keep it coming!\c
Thanks for your time!\c
Let's be good sports about this!\nBig smile!
Ahaha! Ahaha!\nCome on, you laugh, too!\c
I'm cheerful even in defeat!\nAhaha! Ahaha!\c
Buck up.
Not bad.\c
You're good.\c
The sweetest thing about battling?\nThe finishing blow!
Take that!\nThat's my finishing move!\c
Oof...\nI feel your final shots...\c
Hey, you're looking nifty!
Hey, you tried, right?\c
Hey, you're kind of tough.\c
Listen! This is my chorus group.\nMe and my Pokémon!
Shooby-dooby doowop!\c
Oh, wait!\nWe're not done singing!\c
I got tips from my online friends on\nhow to best raise my troop.
I must thank my online friends.\nI don't know who they are, though.\c
Well, this blows!\nMy online buddies let me down!\c
Can I have a moment?\nI'm trying to write some email.
I need to get home quick and check\non my email.\c
What do you think you're doing?\nI want to go already.\c
Father... Mother...\nPlease watch over me...
Father... Mother...\nWere you watching...?\c
Father... Mother...\nPlease forgive me...\c
Can't rightly say I much like\nbattling, I tell you.
I won, but...\nI'm still shaking...\c
Grr...\nI'm so angry I could cry...\c
It's the power of science!
Did you see? Were you amazed?\nThat's the power of science!\c
It's inconceivable... How could the\npower of science be defeated?\c
Charge, my Pokémon! Demonstrate the\nfruits of our experimentation!
Yes, my Pokémon proved my theory!\nI'll get my professorship now!\c
What kind of experiments?\nThat's classified.
I shall regress to my childhood for\nthis battle.
Googoo gagga.\c
Gagga...\c
Fwahahaha!\nYou've come a long way!
Fwahahahaha!\c
Fwahahaha!\nYou're blessed to have your friends!\c
I'll scrap you.
I'll recycle you.\c
Think ecology. Think green.\c
Why, sure! Sounds great!\nWe have to do this!
Bam! All done!\c
A battle while working...\nIt's a good way to take a break.\c
I'll try to do my best!\nPlease give me this chance!
I've done it!\nI've achieved my goal!\c
I tried the best I could!\nThank you for your encouragement!\c
A battle is... It is a love letter\nwritten in sand.
Did you understand what I'm trying\nto say? I guess you wouldn't.\c
Did you understand what I'm trying\nto say? I guess you wouldn't.\c
Hello, you there! Yes, you!\nHold up. Hold it, I say!
OK, kids shouldn't be out now.\nGo home, and be quick about it.\c
You shouldn't mess with a police\nofficer like that.\c
Sssnork... Zzz...
CLEFAIRY... Mumble...\nWait for me... Sssnork...\c
Mutter...\nEhehe... Ssssnore...\c
Let's keep this elegant!
Mmm, yes!\c
You're quite the Trainer yourself!\c
A battle isn't something you\ncan calculate.
What'd I tell you?\nYou win when you win.\c
What'd I say, huh?\nYou lose when you lose.\c
There's lots in life that doesn't\ngo the way you want.
Yippee!\nThings went my way!\c
See...?\c
There's nowhere to run or hide!
This was a foregone conclusion!\c
Farewell!\c
I wait for tough Trainers here,\ncome rain or come shine.
Because of that, I've grown so\nvery strong...\c
Won't a tough... No, forget that.\nI need a cool Trainer to come...\c
This is for keeping the sun off.
I'm strong at battling, but I can't\ntake sunlight...\c
I don't want to roast my skin.\c
Well...\nThose are rare Pokémon...
I've never caught those...\nYour Pokémon are different, all right.\c
Oh, you're a Trainer?\nYou're not a Pokémon?\c
Ready?
Cool.\c
Bye.\c
Beat me?\nTry again in another ten years!
No spine!\c
You're tough!\nYou inspire me!\c
Smelling sweet scents makes me\nso drowsy...
...Yawn...\nOh? Are we finished so soon?\c
...Yawn...\nOh, really? I lost?\c
You're sure you can handle me?\nI'm an ultrastellar talent.
Don't feel bad!\nI'm an ultrastellar talent!\c
You're in the miracle-star class!\c
I live only for battles.\nOnly victories give me hope.
...Naturally.\c

And we're off!
We did it, yeah!\c
Uncle!\c
My Pokémon are a cut apart from the\nusual. Maybe even two cuts!
Their cutting intensity and solid\nattack... Top class, yeah?\c
Grr...\nRendered harmless...\c
The prince among shorts-wearing\nYoungsters, that is me!
I hope I lived up to my title of the\nprince among the shorts wearers.\c
I can't lose here! Not as the prince\namong the wearers of shorts!\c
I can't bear this tension.\nWould they be mad if I went home?
I did it!\nI won somehow!\c
That's gone past my limit!\nI need to be excused!\c
I'm not very good at this, but please\ndon't hold back.
Oh, didn't I say?\nYou shouldn't have held back.\c
Fweh! I wish you would have held back a\nlittle bit!\c
In romance, fashion, and Pokémon!\nToday's girls want it all!
The greed of today's girls knows\nno bounds!\c
Did being greedy end up costing\nme everything?\c
I'm thinking hard about why everyone\nlikes battling so much.
Why does winning a battle make\npeople happy?\c
Why is losing a battle so\ndownright infuriating?\c
I'm trying to keep up with my Pokémon\ntraining and my own schooling.
I'd like to think I've struck the right\nbalance of fun and education.\c
This isn't going to work?\nMy grades are the best in class, but...\c
I crammed hard for this.\nI can't possibly fail!
Yes! I get the win!\nI'm glad I kept with this!\c
It means I need to study at home\nsome more.\c
My Pokémon are my treasures.\nI'll let you see them. Just you.
See? Cute and strong!\nEheheheh.\c
See? They're cute even when losing.\nEheheheh.\c
I won't lose ever!\nPlease abide by my rule!
Thank you so much!\nI owe this win to you!\c
I so did not want to lose...\c
I can do this...\nI can shine here, too!
Yes! I won!\nI'm going to be a star!\c
One day, I'm going to shine as the\nbrightest star in the world!\c
Don't be shy.\nYou can bring it any which way.
Yeah, I figured you'd be like this.\nHeh.\c
W-well, sometimes I have to lose, just\nso I don't crush everyone. Ahaha...\c
My father's wealthy.\nThere's nothing he can't afford.
My father's money bought my Pokémon.\c
There are things that money can't buy.\nI know that...\c
Well, shall we?\nTime is money, and the meter is running.
Well, I'll take my leave. Yet another\nfancy dinner date, you know. Adieu!\c
It's my loss, is it? So be it.\nI had to leave for a date anyway.\c
Uphold the rules of etiquette and\ncourtesy... That's what a lady does.
If I couldn't unwind this way, I would\nlose my ladylike composure.\c
I wish I could be free like the bird\nPokémon in the skies...\c
If I were Honey, then you would be\nGooey Mulch, I would think.
Do you see now?\nHow different we are in level and class?\c
How dare you!\nI won't forget this humiliation ever!\c
Partying, shopping, dining...\nDarling, I've grown bored of it all.
Excitement is so lacking in my life.\nWhat will send my heart racing?\c
Only battling lifts me from this idle\nexistence of boredom and apathy...\c
I'm glad to make your acquaintance!\nMay this friendship be fruitful!
Thank you very much!\nThank you so very much!\c
Thank you very much...\n...Pah.\c
The most natural Trainer is...\nOh, why hide it? None other than me!
This is the natural outcome.\nIt was inevitable!\c
I was battling naturally, and ended up\nwith the loss.\c
Yes! Not a grown-up!\nLucky me! I stand a chance!
Yup, battling another kid is a lot\nless scary.\c
I get really nervous in front of\ngrown-ups.\c
It's hard to keep the streak alive,\nbut the battles are fun.
It's more fun to win, of course!\c
Even losing is fun.\nIt's the wonder of Pokémon!\c
My daddy is a real mountain man. Does\nthat make my mom a mountain woman?
Mountain woman sounds icky.\nNot for me, thank you!\c
I'm their daughter. Is being a mountain\nwoman my destiny?\c
I have a packed lunch all ready, and of\ncourse I have some snacks.
My favorite Pokémon make winning\nso easy!\c
Oh, no, no! I forgot to bring my\nfavorite Pokémon!\c
I frolic with my water Pokémon in a pool\nall the time.
It sure makes me happy winning with my\nPokémon favorites.\c
I'd love to swim in a pool full of water\nPokémon.\c
I promised Mommy I'll practice swimming\nif I lose.
Yay! I won't have to go to the pool\nwith Mommy today!\c
Aww, I lost. Now I'll have to go to\nswimming practice today.\c
I went and caught my Pokémon with\nmy daddy.
I won, Daddy!\nDaddy, thank you!\c
I wonder if Daddy will show me how to\ntrain my Pokémon next?\c
I'm on the way home from the pool, but\nOK, I can battle.
I hope I can go home soon.\nI need some dry clothes!\c
Ah-ah-atchoo! Aww...\nAtchoo! We lost...\c
I'm the captain of a heroic vessel\namong the crashing waves of a storm!
Made it to shore with the ease of a\nreal swashbuckler!\c
That was a bigger crash than I wanted!\c
I just now got back from my vacation.
The beach is a good place to show off.\c
Ooh, my sunburn is itching.\c
Hunh? A battle, is that it?\nSure thing, sure thing.
Hey, you're something special, huh?\c
Yeah, thanks for your time.\c
This is going out to all the ladies.\nBabes, I sing and battle for you!
My ladies, my babes, I won for you.\nYour love is my power, right?\c
I lost, but my love for the babes can't\nbe beat...maybe.\c
This is no guitar I have here.\nIt's traditional and Japanese.
It has only three strings.\nCan you tell what this is?\c
My instrument is called a shamisen.\c
We teen Idols have a secret code\nof conduct that's strictly enforced.
For example, if an Idol wins, she has\nto squeal and jump around.\c
If an Idol loses, she must never act\nangry. That's a big no-no.\c
Do the monster Meteor Mash!\nIt's my catchphrase!
My Meteor Mash goes to your heart!\c
All Idols need a catchphrase,\nespecially right after their debut.\c
You're ever so lucky to get the chance\nto battle with me.
You're super lucky to even battle\nan Idol like me. Don't you get it?\c
Huh? Huh? Now, why did you win?\nYou know I'm supposed to win!\c
Krink... Krak... Heheheh.\nLet me limber up for this.
Hah!\nWeak, even for a joke!\c
Gnnrrr...\nI have only myself to blame...\c
Aren't they pretty? Adorable?\nThey're my beloved Pokémon.
You worked so hard! I'll give you a nice\nmassage at home.\c
What are you doing to my Pokémon?!\nWhat if you hurt them?!\c
I come before you as a member of the\nPokémon Fan Club! En garde!
Long live the Pokémon Fan Club!\nMay it always be glorious!\c
This is hardly a taste of what the\nPokémon Fan Club can bring down...\c
Fan Club Department Manager...\nI hereby accept your challenge.
Heheh... Honestly, you thought you\nstood a chance against the Fan Club?\c
Gwah! I will be avenged...\nB-by the Division Manager...\c
Raising Pokémon with love isn't the same\nas coddling them. Don't you see?
Ooh, you did it! Oh, I love you so!\nMy luvly, wuvly Pokémon!\c
How could you?!\nWhat if my Pokémon are injured?!\c
On behalf of my village, I take on\nthis challenge!
Thank you, everyone!\nThank you for your vocal support!\c
Fellow villagers, I'm sorry!\nMy best wasn't enough!\c
Thank you for your patience.\nHere is the battle you'd ordered.
I trust you were satisfied?\nI feel shortchanged somewhat.\c
I trust you were satisfied?\nI've had my fill.\c
Work is fun, and Pokémon also.\nI am happy I come to this country.
Having fun I am!\nI hoping to live here forever.\c
Oh, why you beat me? So mean!\nI want go home to my country.\c
I'm cool, right? So, everywhere I work,\nthey make me the maitre d'...
I'm a good battler, too. I can't help it\nthat the ladies fall for me.\c
I dream of evolving from a maitre d' to\na celebrity chef.\c
There are no free deals on a battle.\nYou'll get the full course, though.
Where's the fun if you don't battle\nlike you mean it?\c
I take work and play seriously.\nThat's what sparks my passion!\c
Hi, may I interest you in a meal combo?\n...I'm so used to saying that at work!
Thank you, and have a great day!\n...What am I saying?\c
We look forward to your next visit!\n...What am I thinking?\c
Your team looks impressive.\nWill I be OK...?
Oh, what?\nAre those Pokémon only for Contests?\c
Ouch! I said ouch!\nIt was too much! Way, way too much!\c
I love bug Pokémon!\nI love my bug net even more!
I caught my Pokémon using my trusty\nbug net.\c
It'd be cool if there was a bug net\nPokémon.\c
The bugs are my minions, and I'm the\nboss. Are you prepared to lose?
Wahaha!\nWell done, my minions!\c
We were mowed down...\nMy minions have learned the hard way!\c
I'm breaking out of my shell!\nI'm taking it to the next level!
It's like I've sprouted wings!\nViva to the new me!\c
Is it not my time yet?\nDo I need to stay in my shell longer?\c
You transgressor!\nHold still, I say!
I willed myself to victory!\c
C-curses...\nI've brought dishonor on us...\c
Hey, hey, what's that over there?\nIt's... It's a legendary Pokémon!
Kekeke... Ninjutsu misdirection!\nIt worked to perfection!\c
Ninjutsu misdirection was a failure!\nI'll disappear in a puff of smoke!\c
You'll be befuddled by my\ndazzling speed!
Your movements...\nIt's as if you're moving in molasses.\c
I didn't need to do all that dashing\naround, did I?\c
I've been wearing these clothes for a\nlong time. Bathing is for the birds!
Changing clothes takes too much effort.\nTaking a bath is even worse!\c
No, no, no!\nI won't take a bath!\c
I like my mommy, PIKACHU, and my daddy,\ntoo.
A weak Trainer isn't cool.\nI don't like you.\c
A not-wimpy Trainer is cool.\nI like you.\c
Pikapika pikaah!\nPikka! Pikachuuuh!
Piika pikapikka!\nPikka pikkachuuh!\c
Pikka ppi pi piii...\c
When I enter battle, I picture the vast\nsea in my mind.
When I can envision the sea, I feel as if\nI could never lose.\c
When I envision the sea, I don't feel\nthe sting of defeat.\c
In battle and in love, one needs to\nknow when it is best to back off.
After all, both battle and romance can\nbecome quagmires of despair.\c
I may have lost, but I said something\ndeep, in an endless bog kind of way.\c
I'm afraid I got cursed on our last\nexploration of ancient ruins. Ehehe.
Even just now, I have no idea how I won.\nHeeheehee.\c
I may be cursed, but this is fun.\nIt is all so very good. Heeheehee.\c
Seeing buildings and towns from the old\nages sends my pulse racing.
People interested in old architecture\nare potential Ruin Maniacs.
Open your eyes in towns. There will be\nexciting new discoveries. I mean it.
I put this team together with my\nInternet buddies. It took us all day!
We won! I need to thank my Internet\nbuddies for their advice!\c
Aww, darn it! We lost?!\nI'll report it to my Internet buddies!\c
I'm the main character of this story.\nIt's impossible for me to lose.
You're good! Though, as a supporting\ncharacter, you're a bit too strong.\c
...The hero has to suffer a bit so the\naudience feels more empathy.\c
I'm very fickle. I can't stick with any\none thing for very long.
I won, and it's enough for me.\nI'm going to check out the Wi-Fi Plaza.\c
I lost, so that's enough. I'll go to\nthe Safari Zone.\c
I have a ton more experience than you.\nWhat will you do about it?
Not bad, but you need more maturing.\c
Experience alone doesn't ensure any\nwins, I'm learning.\c
Don't you think Pokémon battles are a\nlot like the weather?
Winning makes me feel warm and cheerful\nlike a sunny day.\c
Losing makes me sad like a dreary,\ncloudy day.\c
I was out all night at a party again.\nI'm feeling dizzy from playing games!
I'm so bored of fancy parties and silly\ngames, too.\c
Urp...!\c
Ooh, aren't you the most darling thing!\nCan you win a smile from me?
Ooh, sweetie, I win, so no smile!\nBe sure to win next time!\c
I don't feel like smiling now...but\nI'll be happy to wave good-bye!\c
...Oh, wait one second.\nI have to take this call.
Hi, yup... Yeah, battling... Uh-huh...\nYup, I won... Well, duh... LOL...\c
Hi, yup... Yes, just battled... Nope...\nKid beat me... Uh-huh...\c
Snivel! Hnurrff! Snort!\nThis hay fever is a wicked misery...
Hnurrff! Snivel! Snivel! Snivel!\nI won, but the misery continues!\c
Sniffle. Snivel. Snort.\nI'm not crying. My nose is running.\c
My acute sense of smell tells me how\ntough a Trainer is.
Keep trying. My nose tells me\nyou have great potential.\c
Sniff, sniff... Snort! My nose tells me\nyou've been working hard!\c
Kyahaha! I smell a powerful battle\nin the making!
The sweet smell of success!\c
Defeat smells like a SKUNTANK!\c
I like hard, fast beats in my battling\nand my rock 'n' roll! Let's wail!
And, bam! That rhythm pattern ruled,\nif I may say so myself!\c
Ouch! That's an insult to the ears!\nThose beats were offensive, man!\c
To show you how much this means to me,\nI'll use sound effects from now on.
Raaaah! Dun dun! Dun dun!\nOompa-oompa-oompapa!\c
Blip-bip, blip-bip... Blip... Bweeee...\c
Wait, please wait...\nThe winds... I hear them...
I can hear them...\nThe winds are laughing...\c
I can hear them...\nThe winds... They are in tears...\c
I can't fly...\nBut these babies can soar...
My spirit has been uplifted to the\nskies... Thank you, everyone...\c
You broke my wings...\nI won't ever forget you...\c
Every day, I'm like a migratory bird,\nbut I go in all cardinal directions.
I gained experience while traveling to\nall sorts of places.\c
I'd love to live somewhere where I can\nfind other Trainers like you.\c
I was born unto rolling waves that\nwashed me, with the beach, my cradle.
I was born and grew up on the seas.\nThat's what made me the big man I am.\c
I lost, did I? Time to go to the sea\nand stare inscrutably at it.
Youths of today aim for the world!\nHow's that for deep!
There'd be some mighty cool Trainers\naround the world. I'm sure of that.\c
Go on, kid! Take on the world!\nI'll look forward to your return!\c
What's that? I smell dusty?\nDon't you know the aroma of soil?
See, that's what you get!\nYour team had to eat dirt, get it?\c
Dropped in the dirt by some kid who\ndoesn't know the smell of soil!\c
Sorry for looking so scruffy and dirty.\nI've been holed up in the mountains.
I wasn't really holed up, at least not\non purpose. I was lost out there.\c
It's better to be holed up in the\nmountains than in your room, I say.\c
I'm not supposed to be here.\nCan we do this on the sly?
Even battling can draw attention.\nIt's not easy being a pop star.\c
Pop stars are ordinary girls at heart.\nWe want to enjoy our Pokémon, too!\c
I'm a self-made celebrity.\nDo you have a problem with that?
A celebrity is a celebrity, even if it's\nin my own mind.\c
I want to be the center of attention,\njust me and only me.\c
I'm facing retirement soon...\nI was never admired as an Idol.
I'm going to shine as a star battler\nof Pokémon!\c
I would have liked to end my career\nwith a win in this match...
I think training Pokémon shares a lot of\nsimilarities with a marathon. You agree?
There's meaning in sticking with your\ntraining regimen every day.\c
If you don't pace yourself, you\ncan't win.\c
Howdy! Let's keep it clean, fair,\nrefreshing, and pleasant!
Whew, I feel invigorated!\nPokémon are the greatest!\c
Uh, haha...ha... It actually feels kinda\ncleansing to be thrashed this badly.\c
It's the Workers of the world like us\nwho keep the world going.
There are times we would like to lay\ndown our tools and rest.\c
Don't forget how Workers like us work\nfor you.\c
My wife and boy are waiting on me back\nhome. I can't afford to lose!
I'm sorry, but I had to do this. You'll\nget tougher with a family behind you.\c
Oh, no! How am I supposed to show my\nface around my dear wife and boy now?\c
Pokémon are like family to me.\n...Nah, they are family.
Yes! My family, you did it!\nWe knocked off that mean Trainer!\c
Fwaaaah! That's cruel!\nMy family's hurting!\c
I was too lenient with my Pokémon.\nThey grew up all selfish on me.
Hey, now, enough. Stop attacking!\nThe battle's long over already.\c
Hey, now, the battle's over and done.\nNo attacking the Trainer.\c
You, there. Don't look around now.\nPay attention to me. Focus.
Kid, you're grossly underpowered.\nYou ought to train with me.\c
Oh, yeah. You're better than you look.\nI was wrong about you, kid.\c
Go, my Pokémon.\nBut don't strain yourselves.
Oh, wow, I like how tough everyone was.\nOur Pokémon and you, yup.\c
OK, nice try, gang.\nThanks much for trying.\c
My papa's dream...\nI'm going to make it real.
Papa, did you see?\nWe did it all for you...\c
We lost...\nPapa, I am so sorry...\c
I'd like to take a break.\n...No? We have to begin right away?
Aww, see? You should have taken a\nbreak with me before.\c
Ooh, aren't you a tough one?\nYou should take breaks, though.\c
Yes, yes, looking good!\nI need a smile now. Can you do that?
No, no, no. I need a smile from you.\nLet's see those teeth sparkle!\c
Yes, that's a good smile!\nNow tilt your head toward me.\c
You probably can't tell, but I can see\nright down to your pores.
Yes, I see it, indeed.\nI can see you clearly.\c
I zoomed in on you too much.\nI couldn't see your Pokémon.\c
While battling, I'll keep looking for the\nbest shot of you.
There! And there again!\nDecisive moments in time!\c
Shots of me losing?\nThose get deleted immediately.\c
I'll be bringing you live coverage from\nmy imminent battle!
Our intrepid and beautiful Reporter has\ncarried the day! Go, me!\c
Our intrepid and beautiful Reporter has\ngone down in defeat. Take pity on me!\c
I hate admitting it, but I wanted to be\nan Idol, too.
I didn't want to lose to any Idol.\nThat motivated me to train.\c
This is crushing... I work so much\nharder than any silly Idol...\c
This microphone is what made me a star.\nIt's my all and everything.
Even for a battle, I don't let this\nmicrophone leave my hand.\c
...Thud. Bzzzzt...\c
Hey, 'sup. I should warn you, I'm right\nfast, Trainer. Hold on to your hat.
Trainer, from now on, you can start\nadding Mister to my name.\c
Trainer, that was a real learning\nexperience. Thank you, seriously.\c
This Bike has become an extension of\nmy very being.
Any damage to my Bike, I feel the pain\nas if it were mine to bear.\c
Please! I'll ask you to keep your filthy\nhands off my Bike.\c
When I was little, I hated cycling.\nI couldn't get the hang of it.
I love cycling now.\nI've made many friends riding.\c
Can you ride a Bike?\nIt's healthy and a lot of fun.\c
I'll ride toward the breaking dawn with\nyou on my mind.
I will shift my gears higher and higher\nuntil I catch up to you...\c
My tires have deflated, and\nso has my heart...\c
Let the curtains rise on the festivities\nof muscles and Pokémon!
Did you enjoy our demonstration of\nmuscles and Pokémon?\c
Though I've lost, my muscles and\nPokémon are seared into your mind.\c
They say I have fists of steel and the\nheart of a child.
Oh, yay! Yippee!\nI won, I won!\c
Oh, boo! Boo! This stinks!\nI'm not talking to you!\c
Hwoaaah...\nHwoaaah...
Howatchah!\nHowaaatchaah!\c
Fweeeh...\nFweeehhh...\c
In my dictionary, there is no entry\nfor “restraint.”
The greatest show of respect among\nTrainers is to battle all out.\c
I went all out and still lost.\nOf course it stings.\c
A professional martial artist is in\nperpetual control of his body.
A martial artist must be more than\nstrong. He must also be wise.\c
Gah! I overdid my training and ran out\nof stamina early...\c
When I close my eyes, I can picture you\nbeing defeated. Come on.
Why be sad?\nYou knew this was coming.\c
I berate myself for my own lack of\ncare...\c
I don't like to move much.\nI trained using the Net and TV.
Uhihi! I'm a naturally talented pro at\nboth karate and Pokémon, I am.\c
Oh, man, this is rotten! I'm tired and\nhungry and want to go home!\c
...To get this far, I had to make\nsacrifices. Many, many sacrifices.
It's for this one moment that I live.\c
What else do I have to give up so I can\nbeat you?\c
First, let's battle.\nTalking can wait.
That wasn't bad at all, yup.\nThat goes for you and your Pokémon.\c
You're a tough one, yup.\nWhere do you do your training?\c
Cute little Trainer!\nWe'll squash you flat.
Eheh! You're so cute when you look\nangry and frustrated!\c
What do you think you're doing?\nI hate to lose, I'll have you know!\c
My precious Pokémon will set you right!
My Pokémon have no flaws that you\ncan exploit!\c
I apologize, my dear Pokémon...\nI was caught unprepared...\c
Fwo-fwo-fwo. Youngster, what's most\nimportant is to never give up.
If you give up, that's it.\nThe game's over.\c
Fwo-fwo-fwo.\nYou're an admirable Trainer already.\c
I can tell by the way you look, you're\nquite taken with my dandy style!
You shouldn't be so mesmerized by me.\nLike a MOTHIM drawn to a flame!\c
Oh, you're not interested in me?\nYou're just SHELLOS, if I say so myself.\c
Oh, hello, aren't you a sweetie!\nAre you sure you're up to this?
Oh, now, please don't cry.\nYou should be proud of yourself, dear.\c
Oh, my... You're quite the capable\npractitioner of the art.\c
You and your Pokémon could use an\nobedience lesson from me.
This isn't over until I say.\nOnce more.\c
You defy me?\nHow very amusing.\c
Over the years, I've crossed paths\nwith many a Trainer.
They were all wonderful Trainers in\ntheir own way. All fond memories now...\c
You're one among those many Trainers.\nI'm sorry I wasn't younger.\c
I am a Psychic, though I may not look\nlike one. I'll do something psychic.
I didn't use any psychic power to win.\nNo, really.\c
Did you notice? I was levitating while I\nwas in battle with you.\c
Fwazzam!\nSo! You are my next victim!
Fwazzam!\nHave you no spine?!\c
Fwizzle...\nDon't think there will be a next time!
I can use psychic power, but I prefer\nordinary sleight-of-hand magic tricks.
It's my opinion that psychic power\nshould be left to the Pokémon.\c
I'm a Psychic, but I'm also a student\nof a magician's school.\c
In the next few minutes, you will learn\ntrue terror at my hands!
Hah! Too weak! Too weak!\nWhat pitiful resistance!\c
Noooo!\nI cannot lose!
I see what I have no right seeing...\nLike there. Behind you.
Oh? You can't see it?\nThen, you're fortunate. Giggle...\c
I wouldn't ask about what I see.\nIt's better not to know. Really.\c
The great unseeable power...\nI beseech you for help...
Oh, great unseeable power...\nI thank you for coming to my aid...\c
Oh... Great unseeable power...\nWhy have you forsaken me...\c
Why do I raise Pokémon?\nBecause they are there!
I think I said something deep and cool!\nDidn't I?\c
That's no reason at all?\nThat's the reason in itself!\c
My team has been raised with care.\nI have absolute confidence in them.
You should pay closer attention to the\nunique aspects of your Pokémon.\c
How did you find my Pokémon?\nDid you notice their significance?\c
Everyone, it's showtime!\nGet out and do some clobbering!
Oh, bravo!\nNicely won!\c
Arrgh! How humiliating!\nQuick! Out of the spotlight!\c
I love raising Pokémon.\nIt's what I live for!
Seeing them try so hard to please...\nIt's so unbearably adorable.\c
Don't you dare do that again!\c
I've been devising ways of raising tough\nPokémon from the genetic level.
You can't overlook the role of\nknowledge in raising tough Pokémon.\c
I need to study and understand what\ngenetics is about first.\c
Raise them with love, and Pokémon will\nanswer in kind. Probably.
They responded to my love.\nProbably.\c
You're raising your Pokémon with a lot\nof love. I think.\c
I believe I will approach this battle\nfrom the perspective of a newborn.
Abuboo dah.\c
Ababaa.\nManmaa.\c
If you prevail, I'll recount to you a\ntale from my youth.
Seeing you brings back a flood of\nmemories. Ah, yes, indeed...\c
...Hm?\nI seem to have forgotten...\c
There's no end to either adolescence\nor Pokémon.
See ya! That was fun!\nEnjoy your youth!\c
I'm still a dreamer.\nA precious, unspoiled snowflake...\c
Daddy... Mommy... Can you hear me?\nPlease watch over me...
Daddy... Mommy... Did you see?\nI won, and it's all for you...\c
Oh... Daddy... Mommy...\nI couldn't win...\c
Finally... The time has come to put the\nfruits of my research to the test...
Success...\nSacrificing my youth was worthwhile.\c
No! Nooooooo!\nGive me back my youth!\c
I developed a special Pokémon drink.\nHave some! Bottoms up!
Glug, glug... Belch!\nIt'll make you strong! Don't waste it!\c
My Pokémon drink contains no actual\nPokémon or their byproducts.\c
An analogy for battling is...\nI'd say a bachelor guy.
Heheh, do you get it?\nI doubt you'd get it. No one does.\c
Do you get what I'm saying?\nI doubt you'd get it. No one ever does.\c
Myself, I have been born, raised, and\nspent my life under a circus tent.
My Pokémon, too. They were born and\nraised under a circus tent.\c
The outside world is so very cruel...\nWe shall return to our circus tent.
Oi, you! Yeah, you! Snap to it!\nI'll be training you!
What?! You're down and out already?!\nThis is no bed! Get up!\c
Good! Enough!\nThat will do for today!\c
Fwah? You mean to challenge me?
Fwahaha! I win!\nBetter luck next time, punk!\c
Fwaah?! You defeated me?\nWho are you to do that?!\c
Ooh, it gives me shivers...\nI live for this moment.
Oh, yeah... That's it...\nPerfection doesn't come better...\c
It's gotten so I can't live without\nbattling anymore.\c
OK! I'm going to do it!\nI'm going to show you my best!
Gasp, gasp...\c
Never again!\nYou can forget about a next time!\c
Um... I'm honestly quite tough.\nPlease keep up.
I'm sorry.\nI don't think you measure up after all.\c
I'm amazed.\nI didn't think you'd win...\c
Let's go, me! Go, me, go!\nDon't lose, don't lose, rah, rah, rah!
Way to go, me! I'm so wonderful!\nRah, rah, rah! Gooooooo, me!\c
It's OK, me! Don't cry! Don't cry!\nGo home, go home, goooooo!\c
Woohoo! Here comes a cool Trainer!\nLet's see what you can bring!
Yes! Bravo!\nYou have some good attacks, Trainer!\c
Whaaaaat?! Nooooo!\nI can't get over how tough you are!\c
To serve and protect Pokémon and\nnature. That's my mission!
My skills I developed in the embrace of\nMother Nature!\c
My mission needs me!\nThis is where we bid good-bye!\c
Never fear, this Pokémon Ranger is\nhere to protect my own personal peace!
My personal peace has been protected!\c
You vile Trainer, you!\nYou've shattered my peace!\c
Any bad kids littering the fields?\nAny bad kids fouling the sea?
Be sure to sort your recyclables from\nthe trash when you're throwing it out!
Trash is like a battle.\nDon't be too quick to throw it!
Watch me, darling!\nI'm putting my best into this!
See, darling? Did you see?\nI put in my best effort for you.\c
I can't have my darling see me like this.\nHow pathetic I must look...\c
So, I lead with this... Then, counter...\nUgh, I can't get our strategy right!
To overanalyze can be a bad thing,\nI guess.\c
Waaah! Couldn't you have waited?\nUntil I'm ready at least?\c
How do you like my cape?\nI had it specially made!
What is my cape made of?\nI'm afraid I can't tell you.\c
Rip... Riiiiiiiiiiiipppppp!\n...What?! My cape! Waaaaah!\c
Do you know what real terror is?\nI am familiar with it. Intimately so...
You learned something today, yes?\nThe true meaning of terror.\c
Aiyeeh! What's with you?\nI'm pleading for mercy here!\c
See it! Hear it! Smell it!\nMarvel at my power!
That's right! Use all your senses and\nrealize what you were up against!\c
I didn't see anything! I'm not\nlistening! And I don't smell a thing!\c
Unluckily for you, your winning streak\nends with me.
You lost to me, but you're still on\nyour feet. Kudos to you!\c
This can't be. I won't accept it.\nThere has to be a mistake somewhere.\c
I c-c-can't stop shivering.\nB-but this is a b-battle. I have to.
Urrff... Ch-chatter...\nI won, I won...\c
Sh-shiver... Urf...\nMy eyelids are getting droopy...\c
I'll say good-bye to you now.\nBattles always end in tears.
Fweeeeh!\nMy tears of joy flow freely!\c
Fweeeeh!\nMy tears of anguish flow freely!\c
How amusing! You came here knowing of\nyour certain defeat?
Ahahahah! Very entertaining!\nI shall be happy to see you again!\c
Wh-what is happening...?\nM-my vision is turning milky white...\c
A Trainer am I, a new ray of hope from\nthe land of the midnight sun.
In the frigid falls of the north, I honed\nmy skills. With them, I made you fall.\c
Your foul trickery deserves contempt.\nBut effective it was, too.\c
I've been pondering lately... How much\nlonger will I be wearing shorts?
Will I still be in shorts as a grown-up?\c
If I grow old like this, will they call me\nsomething silly like “Shorts Man”?\c
That's right, I'm the legendary kid in\nshorts who's the talk of the town.
Even a Youngster in shorts like me can\nbe the stuff of a legend or two.\c
My legend is over...\c
Uh... Um... H-hello.\nP-pleased to meet you.
S-s-sorry.\nI'm r-really n-nervous.\c
Uh... Th-thank you.\nThat was f-fun.\c
Oh, this place is so passé now.\nI'm missing out on shopping.
You're kind of stylish, actually.\nOh, I wish I had new clothes.\c
Maybe I'll collect Accessories for some\nContests...\c
Exam season's coming up, but I'm\nneck-deep in battling...
Mom's going to cut me off.\nI just know it...\c
I have to keep up on both my studying\nand Pokémon...\c
Hiya, you Trainer there! Slip on some\nglasses. They'll make you look better.
Nothing's the matter with my eyes.\nI wear glasses for the looks I get.\c
Whoops!\nMy glasses, my glasses.\c
I've been taught every opponent has\na weakness. If I can find yours...
Eheheh.\nI figured out your weakness.\c
Did you figure out my weakness?\c
It's been so long since I had my\nlast battle.
You know, battling is fun after all.\c
Battling is so much fun, but...\c
The age of money has come to Pokémon\nbattling. I'll teach you who is right.
You understand, don't you?\nWhat is right, and who is stronger?\c
M-my Pokémon! What have you done?\nWhat am I to do?!\c
You're my opponent? Oh, all right...\nTry not to disappoint me too badly.
My Pokémon are all tops in luxury.\nDo you see? This is what power is about.\c
Nyah! I don't care! I've got enough \nmoney to fill a swimming pool!\c
You there. Yes, you.\nI'm feeling rather bored.
I suppose that was enjoyable for what\nit was. I thank you for it.\c
You are rather good.\nQuite remarkable, even.\c
I can sink your sort with minimal effort.
It took the barest of efforts to win\nthis match.\c
You swamped us with no effort at all...\c
My room is always full of bugs.\nThat drives my mom just wild.
I want to collect more bug Pokémon for\nmy bug appreciation station.\c
Bugs are loose under my shirt.\nI'm starting to itch...\c
People claim I'm like an adult. Whatever\ncould they mean, do you suppose?
Ah, yes, quite enjoyable!\nWe must do this again, surely.\c
Oh, yes! Smashing!\nThat chilled me to my toes, it did!\c
I have made my choice.\nWhen I fall, it shall be forward!
You lack conviction.\c
...Thud.\c
So, what exactly is a ninja,\nyou may ask.
A ninja is powerful.\nThat will do as a start.\c
Maybe some ninjas are weak?\c
I once saw a lady wearing the same\noutfit as me.
She said, “You're showing serious\nfashion chops.”\c
She said, “You're kidding me,\nam I right?”\c
Will you believe that inside this\ncostume is a grown-up Beauty?
My dream is to live as a Pokémon\none day. To become a Pokémon!\c
I'm an adult, but I want to be a\nPokémon. Does that make me weird?\c
My profile's riding high now, so my\nschedule's filled solid!
Oh, no! It's this late already?\nI'd better check my timetable!\c
Talent manager!\nDo I have time for a rematch?\c
Are you another of my fans? I can give\nyou an autograph if you'd lose?
Here's your autograph! Cherish it!\nOh, sorry! I don't do handshakes.\c
I'm sorry, I was acting GASTLY!\nIt was very DELCATTY of me!\c
I need to diet.\nI have to get out jogging.
Well, I guess I'll go for a quick trot\naround here...\c
Your Pokémon know how to punch hard.\nYou see, I'm really a boxer.\c
I look to bug Pokémon for hints on\nrunning all the time.
I admire the light and agile footwork of\nbug Pokémon.\c
Skitter...\c
Listen, I'm feeling bushed today.\nCan we do this tomorrow first thing?
Oh, all right. You're impatient.\nCouldn't wait till tomorrow, oh no.\c
That's why I said tomorrow.\nI can barely stay awake now.\c
Feed the Pokémon you catch, or they\nwill flee. Do you see?
Once a Pokémon has fled, it will never\nreturn. Do you see?\c
What I said about Pokémon--it is a\nparable. Do you see?\c
When I was younger, I went out on digs\nchasing rumors of hidden treasures.
Of course, there are no such things.\nBut it's about chasing a dream.\c
Well, it sure left huge holes...\nIn the ground and in my bank account.\c
I'll launch an avalanche of moves!\nI'll test your limits of endurance!
Well, Trainer?\nShould I try out some more moves?\c
That's it! I'm all out of stock!\nI'd like you to leave so I can close up!\c
I collect and battle Pokémon so I can\nbrag to my peers.
I'm not all that interested in winning\nor losing to begin with.\c
You've won the battle. But, in terms of\nthe Pokémon involved, I clearly win.
Did you want to see my Pokémon?\nOK, sure. Just a peek, though.
How's that for classy? My Pokémon are\ntops in both moves and character.\c
Hold it right there!\nYou can look, but don't touch!\c
Rock? Samba? Traditional folk?\nI can play in any style. It's all good!
Music and Pokémon uplift me!\nI'm carried up among the stars!\c
Sigh... I'm seeing stars...\nYou've got me singing the blues...\c
Let my exquisite melody ring out!\nHear my Pokémon shout out!
The melody from my Pokémon and me...\nDid it reach out and touch your heart?\c
I've been known to throw matches, but\nI'll never throw a guitar on stage!\c
I'm free like a bird!\nI feel like I could fly!
That's how I ended up becoming a\nBird Keeper.\c
Like most birds, I can't see very well\nat night.\c
As a Trainer, I'm as fragile as an egg.\nPlease be gentle on me.
Do you think I'm getting ready to\ntake flight?\c
One of these days, I'll break out of my\nshell and defeat you.\c
Bear witness to my display of machismo\nand masculinity!
There!\nThat's how a real man lives and battles!\c
Waaaah! Waaaah!\nMommy!\c
I've got a showdown coming up with a\nHiker. Let me see if I'm ready!
Yep, I'd say my team's about ready.\nThat Hiker won't know what hit him!\c
Aww, blast it, no!\nI can't beat that Hiker like this!\c
My showdown against a man of the sea\ndraws near! Let me test my team!
Everything went as calculated...\nBe ready for me, man of the sea!\c
Beating the man of the sea is impossible\nwith an outcome this lame...\c
Uhho uho-uho uhho hohoi!\nThis dance I use to psych myself up.
Uhho uho-uho uhho hohoi!\nSo much fun, I cannot stop.\c
Uhho uho-uho uhho hohoi!\nI dance to stem my tears from losing...\c
I'm not really with the police.\nI'm a collector of uniforms.
Battling as a Policeman made for a very\nfun battle, it did.\c
That's it for me.\nI bid you a fond farewell.\c
I'm a Policeman. But on holidays, I'm\nan entirely different kind of guy.
Usually, I chase after bad guys as\na Policeman.\c
On my days off, I chase after the waves\nand the ladies as a Swimmer.\c
Perseverance pays off.\nA case can turn on that.
It makes for more excitement when you\ncome from behind to take the win.\c
That was more thrilling than any\nstakeout! Thanks for that!\c
My present case can go either way.\nIt's a coin toss.
So, I won this time...\nAll decided by a fickle coin...\c
Best two out of three?\c
I live in the woods.\nYou know, I'm a Camper.
I'm working on making camp life more\ncomfortable.\c
I am sick and tired of camping out in\nthe woods...\c
No, no, I can't do this!\nI'm not cut out for battling!
Oh, wow! I won! What'll I do?\nYou're not mad at me, are you?\c
See! I told you before we started!\nBattling just isn't for me.\c
Trainer spotted!\nIt's time to get cooking!
A battle should be enjoyed like a\ntasty meal!\c
I ended up getting cooked!\c
Fweeoo-fwee-fwee-fyoo...\nI saunter into battle, whistling...
Too easy! I was whistling all the way\nthrough that.\c
Fwee-ooo fwee-ooo fwee-ooo...\nI switched to an ambulance siren...\c
I can hear it... The screaming adulation\nof 100,000 fans rising in unison...
Right on, everyone! You saw that!\nI dedicate my win to you!\c
You're scorching...\nYou've made a fan out of me.\c
Number one worldwide, that's my dream.\nWell, to start, anyway.
“Number one worldwide,” now doesn't\nthat have a good ring to it?\c
I can't quite decide what I should be\nnumber one worldwide at.\c
I'm not some cheap Idol!\nI'm an actress! Please remember that!
My career isn't anything like your\ntypical Idol's career!\c
I'm an actress...\nIt sounds so deliciously right...\c
We're not here for a long time, so let's\nmake it a good time!
Thank you! That was soooo fun!\nI really hope we can battle again!\c
It makes me sad having to say\ngood-bye... Please come see me again!\c
I am the Fan Club Division Manager...\nBring your best to bear...
Kneel before the might of the Fan Club!\c
Gweh! But I did my best!\nRegrets, I have none!\c
I welcome you, young Trainer.\nAllow me to demonstrate my power.
Young Trainer, do you have any idea\nwhat my power signifies?\c
You've surpassed me in your love of\nPokémon. You're the truest of fans.\c
I think I'll try out the TM the woman\nnext door gave me.
I am impressed. That woman actually\ngave me something useful.\c
Oh, that nasty woman!\nThis TM is worthless!\c
I heard that! I may be old enough to be\nyour mom, but I'm still young!
Look at my skin tone and my Pokémon!\nBoth firm but supple!\c
Please don't make that mistake again!\nI'm young, I tell you!\c
Whether it be work or play, I'm with my\nPokémon all day.
Life without Pokémon?\nI can't picture that.\c
It's like I'm married to my Pokémon.\nI'm not married, though.\c
You get to be the best by working\nharder than everyone else.
I reckon I've been a hard worker.\c
Work at battling over and over.\nYour star will shine one day.\c
I'm going to become famous here so I\ncan rebuild the ranch.
I can't lose.\nIt's for my pa and ma.\c
If I can get famous, folks'll pay to\nvisit my ranch...\c
From sundown, I live by candlelight\nuntil I go to sleep.
That's not to say I don't have electric\npower on the homestead.\c
Candlelight can be very romantic.\c
I'd like to introduce you to my\ncherished partners.
Good, good. Good going, gang.\nYou guys all did great.\c
Wheeze... Wheeze...\nI'm feeling faint...\c
I'm no green thumb at growing Berries.\nRaising Pokémon is where I shine.
I can give you tips on raising Pokémon\nso they'll grow tough.\c
Raising a living thing is never an\neasy job...\c
Pokémon are Pokémon, no matter how\ntough, weak, cute, or scary.
Raise Pokémon with love, and they'll\nreturn it.\c
I think it's the Trainer who needs to\npick up the pace here.\c
Raising a Pokémon right takes money\nand time.
But it's all worthwhile when the\nPokémon grows up.\c
To raise the ideal Pokémon,\nI'm willing to work hard.\c
That's right, I'm tough. I won't lose.\nI don't think losing's possible.
Yup, I'm so tough...\nEhehe... Heeheehee...\c
I lost? But, how...?\nWhat now? What do I do?\c
I'm an Ace Trainer, so this is for\nbragging rights.
Yup, you did good.\nNo, seriously.\c
Heh...\nI've got a long ways to go...\c
I was looking forward to a battle\nwith you!
I was right! You are pretty decent.\nWhy not become an Ace Trainer?\c
You're as good as the rumors say...\nMay I have a rematch one day?\c
Look at me.\nI'm what you should be aspiring to be.
You expected anything else?\c
You've already surpassed me.\nBut you can aim so much higher.\c
My whole life hinges on this one battle!\n...Lose for me, pretty please?
Yeah! I won!\nIt's all smooth sailing for me now!\c
I wasn't supposed to lose...\nThat's my life derailed...\c
I'm running a fever here.\nJust so's you know.
Oogh, my head's burning up.\nIt makes me feel more inspired.\c
Like I said, I have a cold.\nI'm not on top of my game.\c
When we battle, I want you to be very\ncareful. My coat's very expensive.
Yikes! Eek! Watch out! You almost got\nPokémon sweat on my coat!\c
I was worried about getting my coat\ndirty. Who cares about your battle?\c
I wish you'd leave.\nI don't want to see you lose.
I told you so...\nCan you leave, please?\c
Listen...is being tough not always a\ngood thing?\c
Whoa-whoa-whoa... Careful now!\nMaintaining balance is the key!
Whoops...! Almost went over!\nHave to be careful here...\c
...Waaaaaah...\nThud!\c
Now don't you worry about a thing.\nYou leave everything to me, OK?
What do you say? Fun, hey?\nIt'd be nice if we could meet again.\c
Well, I'll be!\nYou sure got the best of me!\c
I will battle. It's not likely I will lose.\nI'm tough.
I win.\nI could do a dance right now.\c
What is the matter?\nWhy couldn't I win?\c
Mother Nature, I beseech you!\nPlease, lend me strength!
Oh, Mother Nature, I thank you!\nTo you, I dedicate this victory!\c
I'm sorry, Mother Nature!\nI'm sorry to disappoint you!\c
A good Trainer takes on all challenges\nregardless of the foe or the rules.
No Trainer can be considered bad if\nthey battle the best they can.\c
A good Trainer doesn't gloat over a win.\nThey just prepare for the next battle.\c
Come hither, my Pokémon!\nPlease get rid of this mean Trainer!
Ooh, yes, I love you, my sweeties!\cCome here and give me a kiss!
How could you?!\nYou hurt my sweet little ones!\c
I'm fine with practice and training, but\nI wilt when the chips are down.
I feel sick from tension!\nI'd rather be at home practicing!\c
If it's about practice, I'd be the\nchamp without a doubt.\c
Hi-yah! Hah! Hah!\nOne more! Hah! Hah!
Boo-yah!\c
Hi-yah! ...No, wait!\nNo!\c
Wanna?
Heh...\c
You beat me?\nWhere's your dojo?\c
Come oooon! C'mon, c'mon!\nHey! Hey! C'mon, hey!
Oh, yesssss!\c
Oh, noooooo!\c
Your eyes are unclouded by doubt.\nThis match will be entertaining...
From the bottom of my heart, I look\nforward to your return.\c
Whew... A most entertaining match.\nI hope you'll grant me a rematch.\c
You need to be taught what wisdom of\nage means in battle!
I'll have you know that no child can\nhope to defeat me!\c
That did not happen! Unfair!\nI demand a rematch right now!\c
I'm feeling cranky today!\nHelp me get my mind off it!
Whew... A battle is the perfect\nstress reliever!\c
Eeeeeeeeh!\nYou've pushed me over to furious!\c
Cue battle music, please!\nI want to trumpet my victory!
I love the battle music.\nIt sets my heart racing.\c
Fine, that will do.\nBack to the regular theme music.\c
When you've been a Trainer as long as\nI have, let's just say you'll see a lot.
Things like this happen.\nDon't let it get you down.\c
People and Pokémon are all different.\nIsn't that what makes it beautiful?
My big brother told me to go for the\neyes! Aim for the eyes!
I did it, big brother!\c
My big brother told me to wreck the\nother Trainer's accuracy!\c
I hear my Pokémon calling out...\nThey clamor to battle...
I hear my Pokémon calling out...\nThey call for your return...\c
I hear my Pokémon calling out...\nThey tell me of the fun they had...\c
Behind you, I see light.\nWhat is its significance?
I thought I saw an aura of invincibility.\nI must have been mistaken.\c
Now I see...\nYou glow with the light of victory...\c
I'll deliver defeat to you elegantly\nand speedily.
Thank you for your patience!\c
I'm so terribly sorry.\nI ended up with your intended defeat.\c
Great, another tough-looking Trainer.\nThe fun never ends for me.
Bleah, that was too close for comfort.\nNothing ever comes easy for me.\c
Yeah, see? I knew I'd lose.\nIf only that move landed...\c
Everyone has too much to say about\nPokémon! If it's fun, that's enough!
Excuse me, but are you all right?\nMaybe you're a little too tired?\c
If you get too caught up in winning and\nlosing, you'll burn yourself out.\c
Aren't you the cutest guest! You can\nexpect the best service from me!
Well, were you impressed by the level\nof service I provided?\c
Oh, wait, please!\nI'm not done serving you!\c
I keep a journal about the lives of the\nTrainers who arrive here.
In our vast world, I wonder how many\nTrainers will cross my path?\c
Every encounter ends in parting.\nThat's why I keep a journal.\c
I've waited all my life for someone like\nyou. I'm never letting you go.
It was a ploy to confuse you with\nwords out of some romance movie.\c
Now, go on, don't let me hold you back.\nSeize your chance at happiness!\c
Will you give me an interview if you win?
You made my job too easy.\nYou need to buckle down.\c
Your feelings now, in a word!\nShout it into the mike, please!\c
I'm on a diet...\nI'm so famished...
I'm happy, but if I get excited, I'll get\nhungry. No thanks...\c
Oh...\nYour Pokémon look delicious...\c
Let me make it clear right now, I'm\ntougher than you can stand!
See?\nI wasn't exaggerating!\c
Who are you exactly?!\c
Clear the way! Out of the way!\nWait! Don't go! We have to battle!
Come on, take it up a gear!\nKeep up with me!\c
OK, out of the way! Clear the way!\nLet this loser run away!\c
Safe driving and safer battling.\nThat's my motto.
You can be patient in a battle.\nVictory will come eventually.\c
I'll keep to my own pace.\nI'll catch up to you one day.\c
I only have this Bike to look good for\nthe guys. I can't actually ride.
It was a pain getting this Bike here.\nI had to push it all the way!\c
I'm only concerned about looking good.\nI don't practice enough.\c
I'm not looking for any excitement.\nI don't need any drama.
A battle is all the excitement I need.\c
I recently realized that I'm not cut\nout for this scary job.\c
I'll battle my way.\nYou battle yours.
People are people.\nI'll go my own way.\c
People are people.\nYou go your own way.\c
Today, I have a special treat for all\nmy fans!
Thank you!\nI love your support!\c
Are you really one of my fans?\c
I'm burnt out on being an Idol.\nI want to go home to the country...
I can't quit now!\nKids dream of being me!\c
I miss hearing my mother's voice...\c
I'm one of a kind.\nThat's what I'm saying.
I keep it real.\nThat's what makes me tough.\c
I kept it real, but you won anyway.\nYour reality was more real.\c
Hi! Are you my next opponent?\nLet's keep it clean and fair!
It feels great going all out with no\ndirty tricks.\c
That was an awesome workout!\nWe have to do this again sometime!\c
My needs are simple.\nFishing and Moomoo Milk are all I need.
Winning or losing isn't something I pay\nheed to.\c
I could use some Moomoo Milk right\nabout now.\c
You there! Take a look at the Pokémon\nI fished up the other day.
I can tell you're impressed. This guy,\nI don't know how long it took to land.\c
A word of advice: when an older person\nis bragging, pretend to be interested.\c
You're a Trainer.\nLet your Pokémon do the talking.
Where's your spirit?\nThat didn't speak to me at all.\c
Great! Great!\nYour feelings came across!\c
Here comes your prey!\nGet 'em! Chaaaarge!
Gaahahaha!\nThat's it! Good job!\c
We're outmatched!\nPull back, guys! Run away!\c
Bring it on!\nOoooh! Haaah!
Thank you kindly!\c
Thanks for having me!\c
I am captivated by the mountains.\nThey're the main thing in my life!
The mountains mean more to me\nthan any battle, no matter how fun!\c
Your battle skills are impressive, but I\ncan't wait to return to the mountains.\c
We're going to hammer you, kid.\nDon't freeze up and close your eyes.
I like how you stay defiant even after\nlosing. Good attitude, kid.\c
Honest, I didn't let up one bit or let\ndown my guard because you're a kid.\c
I battle around the globe.\nI'm a worldwide bad boy!
I don't lose at battling.\nI can't get over how cool I am!\c
I'm hitting the road over that loss.\nIt's good-bye to the old me!\c
Battles, I'm good at.\nBut musical aptitude? Forget it.
This whole battling thing is good, but\nI wish I could play music as well.\c
Music or Pokémon...\nIt's a tough choice.\c
I wrote a song using the cries of\nPokémon. I'd like you to hear it.
Graaah wagyaaah! Wagyaaaah!\nChu! Chu! Gyaroooh-gah!\c
Giiyaaaah! Drundundun!\nGaroo-gah! Wawawaaah!\c
I'm bored of collecting and hoarding.\nI'm getting rid of everything now.
There's nothing that I really want now.\nMaybe I'll become a clown...
I threw the match for a start.\nIt's nice to be unburdened of things.
Oh! Hold on a second!\nIncoming text message!
Ticka-ticka-ticka... Ticka-tick...\nHuh? Is it over already?\c
Hey, stop that!\nNo peeking at my text messages!\c
There's no meaning to this battle!\nPokémon should be about love!
Battling leaves me empty.\nHug your Pokémon and show your love!\c
Battling creates nothing.\nHug your Pokémon and show your love!\c
Are you challenging me? ...You are.\nKids these days...
Now run along home, and go help your\nmommy with her chores!\c
Hey, you... If you think playtime will\nlast forever, you'll end up like me.\c
How will you counter my implacable logic?
Everything according to calculation...\nThis victory is a complete one.\c
You outcalculated me.\nI'm incredulous.\c
I've been ensconced in the lab.\nMy shoulders are all knotted up.
What a refreshing break!\nI'm feeling loose and relaxed now.\c
My Pokémon and I, we all need to get\noutside and exercise more.\c
Hmmm... So young...\nI may have to go easy...
You're so depressingly young...\nIt's fine. You may go.\c
Consider the loser's feelings.\nThat's where you young people fail...\c
You see an old man, yes?\nDon't be fooled by the way I look.
I find it abhorrent to lose to any\nyoung Trainer.\c
I was fooled by your youth.\nFoolish, foolish me...\c
As a Worker, it's my job to both build\nand demolish.
Why don't you become a Worker, too?\nI find it fun and rewarding.\c
Making things is harder than\ndemolishing, but it's more satisfying.\c
You and your Pokémon, I'll clean up on\nyou easily.
Well, well, how pathetic was that.\nTake your passengers and go home.\c
Gwaah... So heavy...\nMy guys buckled under the load.\c
Outstanding athleticism and a great\nsense of humor; that's a clown!
A clown is a job of greatness.\nOnly the chosen can become one!\c
The ability to laugh off disappointment\nis another requirement for a clown!\c
Laugh with the face and cry with the\nheart; that's how a clown lives.
Ahahahahaha!\c
Gah! ...Ahahahaha!\c
Oi, listen! I'm a Policeman, sure, but a\nTrainer before that!
What?\nA Policeman can't lose his temper?\c
Yes, I'm a Policeman, but I have dreams\nand aspirations, and, and... Snivel...\c
Hands up! Put 'em where I can see 'em!\nYou're all under arrest!
Case closed!\c
This is a gross miscarriage of justice!\c
I'll have you know that I'm an\nInternet detective.
My powers of observation and\nlogic prevailed!\c
Think you've outsmarted me?\nMaybe this was just a sting operation!\c
Wherever, whenever, and with whomever.\nThat's my motto!
When, where, or whom...\nIt doesn't matter at all to me.\c
Hahaha! This is great!\nI want to keep this going!\c
The loser has to pretend to be a\nSTUNKY, OK?
Giggle, you lose.\nI want to see your STUNKY impression!\c
OK, here's my STUNKY impression!\nThree, two, one...\c
A good breeze has sprung up...\nThis is good! I can win this!
The tailwind put us over the top!\n...As they say!\c
The headwind worked against us!\n...As they say!\c
Even though I always have my parasol\nup, I actually like sunny days.
I hope it will be sunny tomorrow...\c
The heavy downpour in my heart...\nWhen will it ever stop...?\c
My, you're very eager to go. I'd better\ntake the tension up a notch, too!
I had a lot of fun with that match!\nWouldn't it be nice to see you again!\c
You're so full of energy!\nWhy, I feel energized, too!\c
How much longer do I have to wait for a\nTrainer that's any good?
I'm so bored by the weak competition.\nMaybe I'll just retire.\c
Oh, hello, there.\nNow, you're a little special.\c
My ladylike charms don't mean a thing\nto a little kid...
That was too close for comfort!\nIt doesn't pay to underestimate foes.\c
Battling fair and square doesn't appeal\nto me. I'd rather win.\c
Like everything else, people have likes\nand dislikes when it comes to scents.
I love how Pokémon smell after a battle.\c
I feel a little thrill if I catch a whiff\nof intense effort postbattle.\c
Sniff, sniff... Yes! Here it comes!\nAroma power!
With aroma power, I'm invincible!\c
Fizzle...\nI'm out of aroma power...\c
Turn, step, turn, turn... I'll practice\nmy dance steps while battling!
I dance with passion and precision.\nHow can there be a weakness?\c
You're throwing off my rhythm!\nMy dance routine is ruined!\c
I'm always ready for the public eye.\nYou can come at me at your own pace.
That's why people consider me the\nperfect Idol.\c
I didn't know how bad it feels to lose.\nThis is a first for me.\c
   
    
    
   
    
    
   
    
    
   
    
    
   
    
    
   
Ah, wonderful! That was fantastic!\nDo come again!\c
I have no problem with losing to a\nspectacular Trainer like you!\c
   
Ah, wonderful! That was fantastic!\nDo come again!\c
I have no problem with losing to a\nspectacular Trainer like you!\c
What Pokémon do you want up on stage?\nI can't wait!
That was a most enjoyable time!\nThank you! Come again, please.\c
Oh... I detest how fun times seem to\nend so quickly.\c
What Pokémon do you want to show off\nthis time?\rI can't wait!
How wonderful that was!\nThank you! Come again, please.\c
It's so sad how the truly fun times\nseem to last only a moment.\c
It doesn't matter what you throw at\nme. I'll always win.\cMy investigative and analytical system\nis truly amazing.
See?\nJust as analyzed.\c
Whoa!\nYou sure showed me!\c
It doesn't matter what you throw at\nme. I'll always win.\cI'll stake my investigative and\nanalytical system on it!
See?\nJust as analyzed.\c
Whoa!\nYou sure showed me!\c
Always be smiling!\nLuck comes to those who are happy!\cThat's why I always keep a big smile and\nbelieve in my Pokémon when I battle.
You're very good!\nI had a lot of fun!\c
You're so very, very good!\nMy Pokémon had a good time, too!\c
Whenever I battle someone tough,\nI smile. I cannot help it!\cHow about you? What do you do?\nDo you laugh? Cry? Get angry?
Win or lose, whenever I battle someone\nwonderful, I am happy!\c
Battling a wonderful Trainer is always\na happy occasion!\c
Very well...\nShall we begin?
Ah, a most valiant effort.\cThough I was lucky enough to win this\ntime, the next time...\c
My Pokémon could not be faulted in any\nway, shape, or form.\cMy hat's off to you.\c
This is for Lady Caitlin's sake.\nI'm afraid I must go all out.
Ah, a most valiant effort.\cThough I was lucky enough to win this\ntime, the next time...\c
Your skills are superlative as ever!\nMy admiration knows no bounds.\c

...Humph!\cI'm not fighting with another weakling\never again. I don't have time to waste\rlike that.\n
Hey, hey!\nWhy so serious?\n
No way...\n
...Why...\nWhy do I lose?\cI've assembled the toughest Pokémon.\nI didn't ease up on the gas.\cSo why do I lose?\n
Humph. This is my real power, wimp.\cI'll make Team Rocket history.\nAnd I'm going to grind that Lance\runder my heels.\n

I see. Seems it wasn't just luck that's\ngotten you this far.\n
Humph! You were too strong...\n
...I couldn't win...\cI gave it everything I had...\cWhat you possess, and what I lack...\nI'm beginning to understand what\cthat Dragon Tamer said to me...\n
...Humph!\cI knew it. Strength is everything.\nNothing else matters.\n

I see. You weren't coming to Kanto just\nto show off...\n
I see you weren't playing around,\neither...\n
Humph!\nI guess it can't be helped...\n
Hmm, seems my Pokémon are pretty good.\n

Why?!\nI've still got one left!\n
Do you think you've won already?\n
...\cOK. I lost...\n
...\cWhew...\nWith my partners,\rI'm going to be the Champion!\n
Why?!\nI've still got one left!\n

...\cWhew...\nWith my partners,\rI'm going to be the Champion!\n
I hate to admit it, but you win.\n
All right!\nSUICUNE, were you watching us?\n
The wind is finally with us!\n
We can still fly!\n
I understand...\nI'll bow out gracefully.\n
Even though it's my last Pokémon,\nBug Pokémon are tough!\n
Hang in there! Just a little more!\n
Aw, that's the end of it...\n
H-hey! Just one left?\nBut... I ain't losin', you hear?\n
Poor me!\n
Ugh...\n
No, it's not over yet--not yet!\nI still believe we can do it!\n
We've got more discipline than\nanyone else!\n
How is this possible...\n
Properly tempered steel won't be made\nrusty by things like this!\n
Steel will hang on to the very last!\n
Well done...\n
We haven't lost yet!\n
No... Not...yet...\n
We...lost...\n
Humph... You are quite the Trainer.\n
Willow is my middle name.\nWillow is flexible and not easily broken.\rI'm not giving up yet.\n
Hmm. Seems as if my luck has run out.\n
One Pokémon left?\nThis is where the real battle begins!\n
You're kidding, right?\nI'm supposed to win! I already decided!\n
I lost? ...\cI don't believe it.\nThere must be some mistake...\n

Ho ho!\cYou some kind of big shot? We'll see\rwhat happens if you get pushed around\nup here. Think you'll stagger and fall?\cPeople here are training night and\nday to become bird Pokémon masters.\cBring it on!\c
Gaaah!\n
Falkner's skills are for real!\cDon't get cocky!
I can't believe how ridiculously high\nthis is! But from up here, you can tell\rwhat it feels like to be a bird Pokémon!\cLet me see if you're good enough to\nface Falkner!\c
This can't be true!\n
Even though you're a rookie Trainer,\nyou're not bothered by these heights\rat all... You're really something!\n
Amy: Hey, are you challenging the\nLeader? No way!\c
Amy: Oh, goodness!
Amy: You're really strong!
Amy: You have only one Pokémon?\nThat's kind of lonely...
Mimi: If you insist, we'll be\nyour opponents.\c
Mimi: I'm feeling a bit dizzy...\n
Mimi: Our bug Pokémon lost! Oh, what\na shame.\n
Mimi: It's a little unfair to battle\nsomeone who has only one Pokémon.\n
Bug Pokémon evolve young. So they get\nstronger that much faster.\c
Just evolving isn't enough!\n
If you want to meet the Gym Leader, you\nhave to move the web using the switch.\n
You've come all this way, crossing the\nweb like a bug Pokémon!\cAllow me to teach you the charms of bug\nPokémon!\c
You proved how tough you are...\n
Just being in this Gym, I feel like I've\nturned into a bug Pokémon!\n
You saved all the SLOWPOKE?\nWhew, you're mighty!\cBut my grown-up Pokémon are pretty\ntough, too!\c
Urrgggh!\n
If you move the web with the switch,\nyou'll be able to figure out where\rthe lift is going.\n
You shouldn't let your guard down just\n'cause I don't look tough!\c
Gosh...\nI thought you were weak...\n
Who do you think are stronger--\nboys or girls?\n
I like cute Pokémon better than\nstrong Pokémon.\cBut I have strong and cute Pokémon!\c
Oh, no, no, no!\n
I'm training really hard to try to beat\nWhitney, but I'm starting to get\rdiscouraged...\cWhat to do...\nWell... If I lose, I'll just try harder\rnext time!\n
Oh, you are a cute little Trainer!\nI like you, but I won't hold back!\c
Let's see...\nOops, it's over?\n
Wow, you must be good to beat me!\nKeep it up!\n
Give it your best shot, or I'll take\nyou down!\c
No!\nOh, MEOWTH, I'm so sorry!\n
I taught MEOWTH moves for taking\non any type...\n
I shall win!\c
I... I... I lost!\n
The one who most wants to win--will!\n
Not sure of your way?\nDefeat me if you want a hint!\c
Wh-what?\n
Having trouble finding your way around?\nThe path is right before our eyes!\n
I spent the spring with my Pokémon.\nThen summer, autumn, and winter...\cThen spring came again. We have\nlived together for a long time.\c
Wins and losses--I experienced both.\n
Where did Pokémon come from?\n
Can you inflict any damage on\nour Pokémon?\c
Ah! Well done!\n
We use only Ghost-type Pokémon.\cNo Normal-type attack can harm them!\n
My Pokémon and I are bound together by\nfriendship.\rOur bond will never be broken!\c
This isn't real!\n
You seem to have a strong bond with\nyour Pokémon, too!\n
We martial artists fear nothing!\c
That's shocking!\n
Fighting-type Pokémon are afraid of\nPsychic types...\n
Words are useless.\nLet your fists do the talking!\c
...\n
I lost! \nI'm speechless!\n
My raging fists will shatter your\nPokémon!\c
I got shattered!\n
My Pokémon lost...\nMy...my pride is shattered...\n
To get to Pryce, our Gym Leader,\nyou need to think before you skate.\c
I wouldn't lose to you in skiing...\n
If you don't skate with precision,\nyou won't get far in this Gym.\n
Check out my parallel turn!\c
No!\nYou made me wipe out!\n
I shouldn't have been bragging about my\nskiing...\n
Hey hey, are you shivering?\nAre you scared to fight me?\c
You're so strong, it's scary!\n
The strongest don't usually look\nvery strong. I think you fit\rthat description.\n
This Gym has a slippery floor.\nIt's fun, isn't it?\cBut hey--we're not playing games here!\c
Do you see how serious we are?\n
This Gym is great.\nI love snowboarding with my Pokémon!\n
I know Pryce's secret.\c
OK. I'll tell you Pryce's secret.\n
The reason Pryce is strong...\cIt's because every day he sits on top\nof very cold ice and trains his body\rand spirit!\n
Your first battle against dragons?\nI'll show you how tough they are!\c
That's too bad.\n
You've met the Dragon Tamer Lance?\nI don't believe you.\n
It's not as if we all use Dragon-type\nPokémon. It's about more than that--\cWe're interested in strong Pokémon.\nThat's my theme!\c
Just what I expected.\n
I need to make my Pokémon stronger!\cPokémon and Trainers both need\nto train!\n
My chance of losing?\nNot even one percent!\c
That's odd.\n
I know my shortcomings now.\nThanks for showing me!\n
I've been training hard with Clair.\nThere's no way I can lose!\c
...Oh, that's disappointing!\n
Oh...\nLooks like I need more training, huh?\n
Dragons are sacred Pokémon.\nThey are full of life energy.\cIf you're not serious, you won't\nbe able to beat them.\c
Way to go!\n
Dragons are weak against\nDragon-type moves.\n
We Psychics don't give up even when\nwe're down to the last Pokémon.\cThat's what makes us so formidable!\n
Until we hit zero, our power is limitless.\nI'm not giving up yet!\n
I... I can't...believe it...\n
One Pokémon left?\cHa ha ha! I've been counting on this\none from the very beginning!\n
Ooooof...\n
Ah!\nYou have proven your worth!\n
Fight as hard as you can 'til you faint!\n
We're standing firm!\n
Why?!\n...How could we lose?\n
This is far from being backed into\na corner!\n
You're no ordinary Trainer to have\ngotten this far.\n
Well, aren't you good.\nI like that in a Trainer.\n
All right!\nI thought this would never happen!\n
I never give up, no matter what.\nYou must be the same?\n
...It's over.\cBut it's an odd feeling. I'm not angry\nthat I lost. In fact, I feel happy.\cHappy that I witnessed the rise\nof a great new Champion!\n

Heh heh heh... You're unprepared\nfor this. We'll knock you down!\n
Perhaps I'm the one who was\nunprepared?\n
This is the real power of Johto...\n
Ah ha ha! It itches! It itches!\n
Ow ow ow ow ow...\n
Looks like you're the stronger one...\n
Hmm... You're pretty good...\n
Looks like you're not just someone who\ngets in the way...\n
Looks like this is it...\n
It's not over yet. It's just beginning!\n
Oh, last one! Never give up!\n
My electric trick...\n
Don't go easy on me.\nGive me everything you've got!\n
Wow, that's a bit harsh!\n
Looks like I underestimated you...\n
You've got a great battle technique!\n
Not good. Seriously not good.\n
...!!!\nSo... So strong!\n
What will happen after this?\nI already know.\n
Was the future I saw...wrong?\n
I get it...\n
I'll show you the spirit of this\ncave Gym!\n
We can still do it!\n
My spirit has not been defeated!\n
Heh heh heh... You're unprepared\nfor this. We'll knock you down!\n
Perhaps I'm the one who was\nunprepared?\n
Just as I expected! No wonder you've\nbecome the Champion...\n
Ah ha ha! It itches! It itches!\n
Ow ow ow ow ow...\n
Looks like you're the stronger one...\n
Hmm... You're pretty good...\n
Looks like you're not just someone who\ngets in the way...\n

I'll show you the spirit of my\ncave Gym!\n
We can still do it!\n
My spirit has not been defeated!\n
Anyway, fight me and see!\c
I was deceived!\n
Me, I should be a pretty good practice\npartner...\rI shouldn't say that about myself!\n
What do you think? You've never seen\nsuch a wonderful Gym before, have you?\c
Whatever!\n
There are many kinds of Gyms\nin the world, but I really like this one!\n
Looking around the room like that,\ndoesn't it make you a little dizzy?\c
All of my Pokémon...\nAll dizzy and fainting...\n
Looks like you've still got some\nenergy left.\n
Ida: I'm Ida!\nNext to me is Elan!\rTogether, we're a double team!\c
Ida: Wow. You're really something.\n
Ida: If the only thing Gym Trainers\nhave is strength, they won't do well.\cBringing out your opponent's strength\nis also very important!\cElan: You're stronger than we\nanticipated!\n
Ida: All right, let's go!\cI bet that's what you were thinking!\nBut you've only got one Pokémon.\cSo we can't battle.\n
Elan: All right, let's get this fight\nstarted! Come on!\c
Elan: Well, this is surprising.\n
Elan: Phew...\n
Elan: Huh?\nNot enough Pokémon?\n
The Trainers of this Gym use\nRock-type Pokémon.\cRock-type Pokémon have high Defense.\nBattles could end up going a long time.\cAre you ready for this?\c
I have to win these battles...\n
Hey, you! Trainer from Johto!\cBrock is tough. He'll punish you if you\ndon't take him seriously.\n
R-r-r-r-R-r-r-R-R-r-R-R-R-R--CRASH!\c
BOOM!\n
Phew... Broken in pieces.\n
Glub...\cI'm first! Come and get me!\c
This can't be...\n
Misty says I have gotten much better\nin the past few years.\cBut there are still Trainers who are\nstronger than me.\n
I've been relaxing poolside, so I've got\nenough strength!\c
You can't win with strength alone.\n
Hey, let's go for a swim!\nSailors have to be able to swim!\n
Sorry about being away.\nLet's get on with it!\c
I give up!\nYou're the winner!\n
I'll be swimming quietly.\n
Don't get nervous watching my\nmagnificent swimming!\c
You're not nervous at all.\nCool and confident...!\n
Swimming is very good for both\nbeauty and health!\cJust look at Misty, you'll see.\n
Swimming isn't just about speed!\nIt's also about the beauty of grace!\c
I lost beautifully...\n
It seems an intruder has appeared in\nthis Gym...\rI don't like that idea...\n
You're here to defeat Lt. Surge?\nNot if I can help it!\c
Sorry I failed you, Lt. Surge, sir!\n
When I was in the military, this is what\nLt. Surge taught me...\cLock the doors, watch out for fire,\nand always have two electric fences\rfor safety!\n
Lt. Surge saw my potential with\nElectric-type Pokémon.\rThink you can beat me?\c
Ooh, how shocking!\n
The reason that Lt. Surge is protected\nby electric fences isn't because\rhe's a coward! It's so you won't\runderestimate his strength!\n
I'm going to take you down!\nPrepare to be shocked!\c
Gyaaah!\nI was overpowered!\n
Lt. Surge hid the electric fences'\nswitches at the bottom of something...\cThere are two switches. Once you've\nfound the first, the second switch\rshould be right next to it.\n
Jo: We protect Erika!\c
Jo & Zoe: We lost...
Jo: Wow, you're about as strong as\nErika, huh!
Jo: I don't know anyone who has only\none Pokémon!
Zoe: We're going to protect Erika!\c
Jo & Zoe: We couldn't win...\n
Zoe: How come you're that strong?\n
Zoe: I don't know anyone who has only\none Pokémon!\n
There's no way I can let some unknown\nTrainer go straight to Erika!\c
Oh, bleah!\n
I'm too ashamed to face Erika!\n
Do you think a girls-only Gym is rare?\c
Ohh... I lost...\n
Thanks for not going easy on me!\n
How can I get you to understand my\nhobby? Which is...\rtalking in a deep voice!\c
Whoa!\n
The kindness of a woman\nand the strength of a man...\cI want to be a Trainer with both\nthose qualities!\n
My disguise was awesome!\nGrrr!\n
I had you fooled...\n
Ooh... I lost...\nYou're not weak...\n
Oh, dear!\nI wanted to win!\n
Psychic power is the power of\nyour mind.\c
Your mind has more power than mine!\n
You made your mind stronger, not just\nyour abilities.\n
The Fighting Dojo next door was once\nthis city's Gym.\c
I was no match...\n
Karate King, the master of the Fighting\nDojo, was just destroyed by Sabrina.\n
The power of all those you defeated\ncomes to me!\c
Strong...\nFar too strong...\n
What is the source of your power?\n
Fufufufu...\nI see it clearly.\cI can see into your spirit!\c
Though I read you,\nI still lost...\n
Oops! I forgot that I predicted I would\nlose to you.\n
You there!\nWant to battle?\c
Down and out...\n
You're strong.\nYou obviously have trained hard.\n
If Trainers meet, the first thing to do\nis battle.\c
Awww... I've got a losing record...\n
For Trainers, it's a given that we'll\nbattle whenever we meet.\n
My bug Pokémon are tough.\nPrepare to lose!\c
I was whipped...\n
I'm going to look for stronger\nbug Pokémon.\n
My bug Pokémon have been waiting\nfor you!\c
If you walk in tall grass wearing\nshorts, do you get nicks and cuts?\c
Ouch, ouch, ouch!\n
They'll really sting when you take\na bath.\n
Why do girls dislike bug Pokémon\nso much?\c
No good!\n
Bug Pokémon squish like soft, toy\nPokémon when you squeeze their bellies.\cI love how they feel!\n
Have you come to understand the merits\nof bug Pokémon?\c
Ah!\nThe weather's as fine as ever.\c
It's sunny, but in my heart,\nit's rainy...\n
When it rains, it's hard to get fired up.\nI just simmer...\n
Step right up and take a look!\c
Yow! That's hot!\n
The greatest fire-breather in Kanto,\nthat's me.\cBut not the best Trainer...\n
Hmmm...\nI don't know what to do...\c
I knew I'd lose...\n
You looked strong.\nI was afraid to take you on...\n
I can run like the wind!\c
Blown away!\n
I wear shorts the whole year round.\nThat's my fashion policy.\n
I'm raising my Pokémon.\nWant to battle with me?\c
Aw, I can't believe I lost...\n
If you have a specific Pokémon that you\nwant to raise, put it out first, then\rswitch it right away.\cThat's how to do it.\n
I have a feeling that I can win.\nLet's see if I'm right!\c
Aww, you are too strong.\n
I heard CLEFAIRY appear at Mt. Moon.\nBut where could they be?\n
Um...\nI...\c
...\n
...\c...I'll go train some more...\n
My PHANPY is the cutest in the world.\c
My PHANPY!\n
Take a look at this--this PHANPY's\nabsolutely adorable behavior!\cIsn't it wonderfully cute?\nI just wanna squeeze it!\n
My TEDDIURSA is the cutest in\nthe world.\c
My TEDDIURSA!\n
Take a look at this--this TEDDIURSA's\nabsolutely adorable behavior!\cIsn't it wonderfully cute?\nI just wanna squeeze it!\n
We're the Kanto Pokémon Federation\nTrainer group.\rWe'll drive you under our wheels!\c
S-sorry!\n
The Kanto Pokémon Federation will\nnever fall!\n
The cops shut down our Underground\nPath! That really annoys me!\c
F-forgive me!\n
Wiped out by some punk from Johto...\n
We're the Kanto Pokémon Federation!\nRock on!\c
Yikes! Sorry!\n
We'll try not to disturb anyone from\nnow on...\n
How does the Magnet Train work?\c
I wish I had the chance to see\nthe Magnet Train...\n
The power of magnets is awesome!\n
Hmm... You've got many Gym Badges.\c
Just as I thought...\nYou're tough!\n
That's to be expected for someone who\nhas as many Gym Badges as you do!\n
I came to explore Rock Tunnel.\c
Whoa! Danger, eh?\n
My Pokémon were hurt before even\nentering Rock Tunnel.\cI'd better take them to a Pokémon\nCenter right away.\n
Hey, you!\nDon't litter!\c
I was just pointing out...\n
Sorry. You weren't littering. It was\nmy mistake.\n
Mt. Silver is in Johto, right?\cIt must be a silver mountain!\c
I was kind of focused on the mountain\nand forgot my Pokémon...\n
Battles are about concentration.\n
I'll tell you a secret.\nBut first, we battle!\c
Grr!\nI lost that...\n
The Power Plant is across a small river.\n
Have you ever been to a picnic?\nThey're so much fun!\c
Ohhhh!\n
We bake lots of goodies and share them\naround. They're delicious!\n
People shouldn't leave any\nlitter behind.\c
Ohh... I lost...\n
Conserving energy is important, but the\nenvironment is even more vital.\n
You really love Pokémon, don't you?\nI love Pokémon, too!\c
Looks like this means it's my loss.\n
My dearest, very important Pokémon...\nI won't forget what you did!\n
Hahahah!\c
Hahaha-hachoo!\n
Hay fever is making me sneeze!\nAhahah-CHOO!\n
...\c
...\n
...\cI lost while I had my eyes closed...\n
I can see it...\nEverything there is to see about you...\c
I couldn't foresee your power...\n
Strength in conviction...\cYou're strong because you believe in\nyour Pokémon.\n
There's no cheating with Pokémon.\nLet's keep it fair and square!\c
Huh? How did this happen?\n
I fought fair and square.\nI don't regret this at all.\n
It itches and tickles a bit when I wear\nshorts in the grass.\c
Aiyaaah!\nI got stomped!\n
I'm going to catch more Pokémon in\nthe grass.\n
Do you remember?\c
You do remember?\n
The tug you feel on the fishing line when\nyou hook a Pokémon...\cThat's the best feeling ever for an\nangler like me.\n
Ooooh! You did remember it!\c
Patience is the key to both fishing and\nPokémon.\c
Patience!\n
I'm too impatient for fishing...\n
I feel so content, fishing while listening\nto some tunes on my radio.\c
I was listening to my radio the whole\ntime... Is that why I lost?!\n
Have you checked out Kanto's radio\nprograms? We get a good variety here.\n
What's most important in our\neveryday lives?\c
The answer is coming up next!\n
I think electricity is the most\nimportant thing in our daily lives.\cIf it weren't, people wouldn't have\nmade such a fuss when the Power Plant\rwent out of commission.\n
Agility is the key attribute of\nbird Pokémon.\c
You beat me with your speed...\n
Your Pokémon are remarkably\nwell trained.\n
Check out my Pokémon. Just look at\ntheir coloring and plumage.\c
Shoot!\nNot good enough!\n
If you groom them, Pokémon get happy.\n
Ha ha ha ha!\rWould you like to fight my pack\nof PIKACHU?\c
My PIKACHU!\n
You look like you have many Pokémon,\nbut PIKACHU is still the best.\n
Bow down before my regal Pokémon!\c
How... How dare you mock royalty!\n
Doesn't everyone wish to be\na ruler someday?\n
I should go to Rock Tunnel to get\nmyself an ONIX.\c
I lost...\n
Geological features don't appear to\nchange.\cBut they actually do change, little\nby little.\n
Hey, I still wanted to battle you!\c
Let me tell you, I had a hard time\ncatching my prized Pokémon.\c
Awaaah!\n
SQUIRTLE, CHARMANDER, and\nBULBASAUR...\rI think that's a well-balanced mix.\n
Sometimes I go back to the places\nI met my Pokémon.\rThey bring back good memories.\c
Where did I meet this PSYDUCK?\n
When and where did I get my Pokémon...\cI'll bet if I checked my Trainer Memo,\nI'd remember!\n
My dream is to fly with my beloved\nbird Pokémon.\c
I can dream, but I can't ever fly...\n
You have Pokémon that know the HM move\nFly, don't you? I envy you.\n
Hang on. I have to phone my mom.\c
Sorry, Mom!\nI was beaten!\n
My mom worries so much about me, I have\nto phone her all the time.\n
We're on a school trip to Lavender\nRadio Tower for social studies.\c
You're wickedly tough!\n
I'm tired of walking. I need to take\na break.\n
Let's battle.\nI won't lose!\c
I forgot to do my homework!\n
Sayonara! I just learned that in my\nforeign-language class.\n
I love gym class the best!\c
Oh, no!\nHow could I lose?\n
If Pokémon were a subject at school,\nI'd be the best!\n
Welcome, welcome!\cHere you will face a battle with me, and\nI'm really athletic!\c
Have you forgotten anything?\c
Kyaaah!\n
Before I became a teacher, I used to\nforget a lot of things.\n
On sunny days, I think that the kids\nwould rather be playing in the\rplayground than studying in class.\c
I didn't want to lose...\n
Studying is important, but exercise is\njust as vital.\n
You're back.\cTo study?\nOr to battle Pokémon?\c
Hey, you!\nYou're from Johto, huh?\c
Whoa, you're kickin'!
Don't get cocky, you Johto punk!\n
Hey! I've been waiting for you!\nYou Johto punk!\c
Wow. That's a cool Bicycle!\c
But you don't just look cool...\n
I look cool, but I'm weak, so I'm not\nreally cool. I have to train harder...\n
Hey! Want to have a speed battle?\c
Yikes! You've got awesome torque!\n
Hands-free riding is considered cool on\nCycling Road.\n
We're fearless highway stars!\c
Arrrgh! Crash and burn!\n
Reckless riding causes accidents!\nTake it easy!\n
If you're looking for Pokémon, you have\nto look in the tall grass.\c
Aiyeee!\n
Since you're so strong, it must be fun\nto battle.\n
Cycling Road is a quick shortcut\nto Celadon.\c
...Whew!\n
If you don't have a Bicycle, you're not\nallowed to use the shortcut.\n
Have you ever gone swimming in the sea\nat night?\c
Glub...\n
At night, the sea looks black. It feels\nlike it will swallow you up.\n
Swimming?\nI'm lousy at it. I'm just splashing\raround in these shallow waters.\c
I thought I could win.\n
I might be bad at swimming, but I love\nthe sea.\n
Pant, pant... Just...a little...\nfarther...to...Fuchsia...\c
I'm drowning!\n
I...asked my girlfriend to swim to\nFuchsia... Gasp...\n
I'm disgusted by wimpy people!\c
I could beat you at swimming...\n
It's a quick swim between Fuchsia and\nSeafoam Islands...\cSheesh, some big man my boyfriend is!\nWhat a wimp!\n
I guess it's impossible to swim all the\nway to Johto.\c
Aiyah!\n
Besides the sea, I can also swim in\nponds and rivers.\n
I feel so much lighter in water.\c
Oh, no!\n
Swimming exercises your full body.\nIt's really good for you.\n
What an impressive collection of Gym\nBadges. We should battle!\c
No!\n
Surf is no longer the only HM move you\nuse in water.\n
I'm bored by fishing. Let's battle!\c
Utter failure...\n
I'll just go back to fishing...\n
Gotta keep going!\c
Glug...\n
This arrogant guy was at\nCinnabar's volcano.\n
Oh! Hey, you!\nWill you help me with my sunblock?\cDon't tell me... You'd rather battle?\c
I'm worried about sunburn...\n
I have to watch out for blemishes\ncaused by the sun.\n
Ayieeeh! No, no, no, believe it I can't!\nStrong very much be you! Match I am\rnot to you!\n
OK! I'm No. 4. I'll stomp you!\c
Whoa! Too much.\n
We both did our best.\nI have no regrets!\n
But after seeing how you battle, I want\nto see how I'll fare.\cHow about it? Let me take you on.\c
I've never had a battle this good!\n
That was a great battle!\cYou and your Pokémon are truly\noutstanding!\n
I'm No. 5!\nGetting tired?\c
I lost, too...\n
I did my best.\nI have no regrets.\n
I'm the last in line, but I tell you,\nI'm tough!\c
You're kidding!\n
I did my best.\nI have no regrets.\n
I'm second.\nNow, it's serious!\c
How could I lose?\n
I did my best.\nI have no regrets.\n
Beat the six of us Trainers to win a\nfabulous prize!\cThink you've got what it takes?\c
Whoo! Good stuff.\n
I did my best.\nI have no regrets.\n
Here's No. 3!\nI won't be easy.\c
Ow! Stomped flat!\n
I did my best.\nI have no regrets.\n
Mufufufu...\cI have nothing to do with the\nsix-pack Trainers.\cI waited here to beat you when you were\ntired out by all the battles.\c
Aren't you tired at all?\n
I'm sorry... I won't cheat anymore...\n
I'm making my final preparations for the\nPokémon League.\c
I blew it!\n
It's going to be tough to win at the\nLeague. I need to do some more\ctraining. I hear that the League's Elite\nFour are tougher than Gym Leaders.\n
By experiencing tough battles, you\ngain power.\c
Gah! Life is even tougher!\n
To get to the Pokémon League, you\nhave to get through Victory Road.\cBut Victory Road is tough.\nPractically nobody goes there!\n
I want to see how close you are to\nreal strength!\c
Since you've come this far, you must be\ngood. I'm going to give this battle\reverything I've got!\c
No! I don't believe this!\n
I've defeated eight Gym Leaders, so I\nwas feeling confident.\cI'll have to try harder next time.\n
I lost to a redheaded Trainer. He was\nreally strong, but...it was as if he\rabsolutely had to win at any cost.\rI felt sorry for his Pokémon.\c
Pokémon aren't tools of war.\n
Pokémon are invaluable, lifelong\npartners.\n
You get along really well with your\nPokémon, don't you?\rCan you show me once more?\c
Wow, look at all those Badges!\nI'm impressed.\cBut you're not satisfied by just\ncollecting them, right?\c
Good battle!\n
People and Pokémon grow from\ntheir experiences.\cDon't get lazy and complacent.\n
I'm feeling great today!\rI feel like I could even beat the\nLeague Champion!\c
No!\nNot in this battle!\n
Just like in fishing, it's all over in\nPokémon if you give up.\n
Tweet! Tweet!\nTet-weet!\c
Tweet!\n
Bird Keepers like me mimic bird whistles\nto command Pokémon.\n
Tweet! I've been waiting for this!\nTeweet!\c
You look pretty strong.\nLet me battle you!\c
...!\n
If you prevail on this harsh trek, the\ntruth will be revealed!\cHeh, sorry, I just wanted to say\nsomething cool.\n
Hm? You're good, aren't you?\c
Just as I thought!\n
A good Trainer can recognize other\ngood Trainers.\n
You came from New Bark Town?\nYou must be exhausted.\c
Oh! You're much too strong!\n
If you're that energetic, you can\ndefinitely make it to the\rPokémon League!\n
You said you came from New Bark Town,\nright? I'll watch and see how far\ryou'll go!\c
It's rare to see anyone come here.\nAre you training on your own?\c
Oh! You're really strong!\n
I'm checking out pre- and\npost-evolution Pokémon. Evolution\rreally does make Pokémon stronger.\cBut evolved forms also learn moves\nlater on.\n
Don't say a thing! Let me guess what\nyou're thinking. Mmmmmmm...\cI got it! You're on the Pokémon\nLeague challenge!\c
You're too much!\n
With your skills, you'll do well at the\nPokémon League. That's what my\rpremonition says.\n
I just lost, so I'm trying to find\nmore Pokémon.\cWait! You look weak! Come on,\nlet's battle!\c
Oh...\nI'm out of Pokémon that can fight.\n
I knew it--if you don't have many\nPokémon, battles are harder!\rI need to catch more Pokémon!\n
I've been waiting!\nLet's battle now!\c
You're a Pokémon Trainer, right?\nThen you have to battle!\c
That's strange.\nI won before.\n
Becoming a good Trainer is really tough.\nI'm going to battle other people to\rget better.\n
Instead of a bug Pokémon, I found\na Trainer!\c
Argh! You're too strong!\n
I ran out of Poké Balls while I was\ncatching Pokémon.\cI should've bought some more...\n
I caught a bunch of Pokémon.\nLet me battle with you!\c
Awwwww...\n
You can catch Pokémon even if you have\nsix with you.\cIf you catch one, it'll go to your Box\nautomatically.\n
I was waiting for you. Let's battle!\c
That Badge!\cIt's from Violet City!\nYou beat Falkner?\c
I know what my weaknesses are.\n
I should train again at the Gym in\nViolet City.\n
That glance...\nIt's intriguing.\c
Hmmm. This is disappointing.\n
If you don't want to battle, just avoid\neye contact.\n
Whoa!\cYou made me lose that fish!\c
Sploosh!\n
Calm, collected...\cThe essence of fishing and Pokémon is\nthe same.\n
I'm really good at fishing, but I'm even\nbetter at Pokémon!\c
Tch! I tried to rush things...\n
Fishing is a lifelong passion.\nPokémon are lifelong friends!\n
Oh look, a kid challenger!\nThis old man ain't losing today!\c
My Pokémon?\nFreshly caught!\c
Splash?\n
Freshly caught Pokémon are no match\nfor properly raised ones.\n
Uh-huh. Yeah, and you know...\cPardon? Pokémon battle?\nI'm on the phone.\cOh, all right.\nI'll accept your challenge!\c
Pfft.\nBefore I could get serious, I lost!\n
At least I can complain over the phone.\n
You're late! Let's get started now!\c
I haven't seen you around before.\nSo you think you're pretty tough?\c
You're strong!\n
I'm going to try to be the best with my\nprized Pokémon. I'm not using the\rsame tough Pokémon as everyone else.\n
I found some good Pokémon in the grass!\nI think they'll do it for me!\c
Shucks. I thought I could win.\n
Each Pokémon has its own nature.\nThey seem different every time I catch\rone. So there must be many natures!\n
I came through the cave, but I still\nhave plenty of energy left.\c
Whoa! You've got more zip than me!\n
We Hikers are at our best in\nthe mountains.\n
All righty, then!\nMy Pokémon and I are raring to go!\c
I'm confident in my ability to raise\nPokémon. Want to see?\c
Didn't I train enough?\n
Hmm... Maybe I should take them to\nPokémon Day Care? What should I do?\n
Hey, you're back!\cBattle my carefully trained Pokémon!\c
I just got my Pokémon back from\nDay Care. Let's see how much stronger\rit got!\c
Why does it end this way?\n
My Pokémon knew moves I didn't know it\nhad. That confounded me to no end!\n
Kate: You sure were mean to my\nlittle sisters!\c
Kate: No! I can't believe I lost.\n
Kate: You're too strong. I didn't stand\na chance.\cHere. You deserve this.\n
Irene: Eeek! A Trainer!\c
Irene: Ohhh! Too strong!\n
Irene: My sister Kate will get you\nfor this!\n
Jenn: You can't beat Irene and go\nunpunished!\c
Jenn: So sorry, Irene! Sis!\n
Jenn: Don't get cocky! My sister Kate\nis tough!\n
Are you a Trainer? Let's have a\npractice battle.\c
Oh, no!\nI just can't win...\n
You're too strong to be a\npractice partner.\n
You're here! You're here! I've never\nhad a practice partner before!\c
What's with you?\nWhat are you doing?\c
You don't have to worry about the night\nwhen you're with strong Pokémon.\n
The group stealing other people's\nPokémon seems to be growing lately.\rYou should be careful, too.\n
This is where I do my training!\c
Whoa!\n
If you fail in practice, then you have\nto try harder! I'm aiming to be a\rGym Leader!\n
I'm the best in my class at Pokémon.\c
No! There are better Trainers...\n
I'm trying hard so I can be the star in\nmy class.\n
I've been waiting!\c
What kinds of Poké Balls do you use?\c
Yikes! Not fast enough!\n
Some Pokémon flee right away.\nTry catching them with Kurt's Fast Ball.\cWhenever I find a Wht. Apricorn,\nI take it to Kurt. He turns it into a\rcustom Ball.\n
I've been getting Pokémon data off my\nradio. I think I'm good.\c
I give up!\n
Music on the radio changes the moods of\nwild Pokémon.\n
I'm gonna show my girlfriend I'm\nhot stuff!\c
I wish you would have lost for me...\n
I was humiliated in front of\nmy girlfriend...\n
I'm practicing my fire breathing.\c
Ow! I scorched the tip of my nose!\n
The Pokémon March on the radio lures\nwild Pokémon.\n
I've been practicing breathing fire\nwhile waiting for you!\c
Behold my dexterity and grace!\c
Whew! That was a jolt!\n
I was going to dazzle you with my prize\nPokémon. But your prowess\relectrified me!\n
Yo! I've been waiting!\c
I'll go anywhere if bug Pokémon\nappear there.\c
I see. So you can battle that way.\n
My VENONAT won me the Bug-Catching\nContest at the National Park.\n
As long as I've got bug Pokémon, it\ndoesn't matter how long I have to wait.\rI know I won't get bored!\c
My boyfriend's weak, so I can't rely\non him.\c
Oh, my! You're so strong!\n
I can count more on my Pokémon than on\nmy boyfriend.\n
Are you going to the Gym? Me, too!\c
Oh. I couldn't win...\n
The Gym Badges are pretty.\nI collect them.\n
Danger lurks in the night!\c
Whoops!\n
You know, nighttime is fun in its own\nway. But don't overdo it, OK?\n
Let me guess what you're thinking!\c
I was wrong.\n
If you read your opponent's mind, then\nyou can attack more efficiently!\n
I can properly prepare for any\nPokémon adversary!\c
Huh...?\nWas my prediction incorrect?\n
Sniffle... I study for five hours\nstraight every day...\cIf you only read the textbook, I guess\nyou miss out on a lot.\n
I've prepared perfectly, waiting\nfor you!\c
Pokémon can't do a thing if they are\nasleep. I'll show you how scary that is!\c
I lost. That's pretty sad...\n
Making Pokémon sleep or paralyzing\nthem are good battle techniques.\n
Tori: Let's battle!\c
Tori: I lost...\n
Tori: Even though I teamed up with Til,\nwe still lost...\n
Tori: Let's have a Pokémon battle when\nyou've got at least two Pokémon.\n
Til: All right, I'm bringing out\na Pokémon.\c
Til: I lost...\n
Til: Even though Tori tried very hard\nfor me, we still lost...\n
Til: We can't battle you if you've only\ngot one Pokémon...\n
Fly high into the sky, my beloved\nbird Pokémon!\c
I feel like just flying away now.\n
I plan to train in Cianwood City to teach\nmy Pokémon how to Fly.\n
Hey, are you good at Pokémon?\cIf you're really good, I want you to\nteach me some things.\c
I see. So you can battle that way.\n
I know something good!\cMoomoo Farm's milk is famous for\nits taste.\n
Oh, here you are again!\nThere's so many more things I want to\rlearn from you!\c
I've been overseas, so I know about all\nsorts of Pokémon!\c
Your skill is world class!\n
All kinds of people around the world live\nhappily with Pokémon.\n
Let me try something I learned today.\c
I didn't study enough, I guess.\n
I have to take so many tests, I don't\nhave much time for Pokémon.\cSo when I do get to battle, I really\nconcentrate.\n
You've come to the right place!\cTime for me to try out everything I've\nlearned today!\c
Hi! Aren't you a cute Trainer!\nMay I see your Pokémon?\c
I'm glad I got to see your Pokémon!\n
When I see Pokémon, it seems to soothe\nmy nerves.\n
Let me see what your Pokémon are\ncapable of.\c
Ooh, your Pokémon have potential.\n
You know how Pokémon have\ndifferent abilities?\cPeople are like that, too. Everyone has\ndifferent potential.\n
Is it OK to brag about my Pokémon?\c
I couldn't brag...\n
I'm not listening to your bragging!\nWe Pokéfans have a policy of not\rlistening to other people brag!\n
I've been waiting!\nI've been wanting to brag to you!\c\n
Such darling Pokémon. Let's show our\nPokémon together at the same time.\c
I don't mind losing.\n
Do you know about baby Pokémon?\nI'll bet they're just adorable!\n
I just got back to Olivine.\nSo, how about a Pokémon battle?\c
Awaaargh!\n
My Pokémon were caught and raised\noverseas. They're my companions on\rthose long voyages.\n
You have to warm up before going into\nthe water.\cThat's basic.\c
OK! I give up!\n
Cianwood City is a good distance away\nfrom here.\n
Hey, you're young and fit!\nDon't ride your Pokémon! Swim!\c
Uh-oh. I lost...\n
Swimming exercises your entire body.\nIt's healthy.\n
Are you going to Cianwood?\cHow about a quick battle first?\c
I lost that one!\n
I'd say I'm a better swimmer than you.\nYeah!\n
No inflatable tube for me.\nI'm hanging on to a sea Pokémon!\c
Ooh, I'm feeling dizzy!\n
While I float like this, the waves carry\nme along.\n
The water's warm here. I'm loose and\nlimber. Sure, I'll take you on!\c
Yikes! I've got prune skin!\n
Isn't it relaxing, just floating\nlike this?\n
I'm a bit tired. If I win, lend me your\nPokémon.\c
Pant, pant...\n
It's so far to Cianwood. But it's no\neasy return trip to Olivine either.\rWhat should I do?\n
See those islands that are blocked\nby whirlpools?\rThere just has to be a secret!\c
What's the secret to your strength?\n
It was a dark and stormy night...\cI saw this giant Pokémon flying from\nthe Whirl Islands.\cFeathers were scattering from its\nsilver wings.\n
The waves are wild here.\nThey tire you out as you swim.\c
I'm beat!\n
The currents keep me from reaching\nthat island.\n
Are you seeking the secrets of the\nWhirl Islands?\c
Ooh, you've got great endurance!\n
A secret about the Whirl Islands...\nIt's pitch black inside!\n
I'm on my way to the Whirl Islands.\nI'm going exploring with friends.\c
Is that how you do it?\n
There's supposed to be a big Pokémon\ndeep beneath the Whirl Islands.\rI wonder what it could be?\n
You look so elegant riding\nyour Pokémon.\c
I'm crushed...\n
Wasn't there a hit song about a boy\nriding a LAPRAS?\n
The weather is so beautiful, I'm in\na daze!\c
Ohhh!\n
A sunburn is the worst for skin.\cBut I don't use sunblock.\nI won't pollute the water.\n
If you need to rest, just tread water.\nYou'll get your breath back so you can\rkeep on going strong.\c
Oh! You have more energy than I do.\n
I heard roars from deep inside\nthe islands.\n
At night, STARYU gather near the\nwater's surface.\c
Oh, dear...\n
The clusters of STARYU light up at the\nsame time. It's so beautiful,\rit's scary.\n
Let me demonstrate the power of the\nPokémon I caught!\c
What? That's not right.\n
I want to become the Trainer Champ\nusing the Pokémon I caught.\rThat's the best part of fishing!\n
Me? I haven't been waiting at all.\nI didn't know that fishing would be\rso boring!\c
Hey!\cThis is my secret place!\nGet lost, you outsider!\c
I should have used my Moon Stone...\n
You're working on a Pokédex?\cWow, you must know some pretty\nrare Pokémon!\rMay I please see it? Please?\n
What's the other side of Mt. Mortar\nlike, do you know?\cIf you can beat me, I'll let you know.\c
Gwah ha ha!\nI lost!\n
I said a pretty boastful lie. I'm sorry!\cThere's this huge waterfall in the way,\nso I've never been on the other side of\rMt. Mortar!\n
I can do so much with my Pokémon!\nIt's super fun!\c
Losing isn't fun at all...\n
What is going on at Lake of Rage?\nWe were planning to camp there.\n
I'm in a slump.\cMaybe it's the gear I'm using.\nLet's battle for a change of pace!\c
I lost, but I feel better anyway.\n
Kurt's Lure Ball is the best for\ncatching hooked Pokémon.\cIt's much more effective than an\nUltra Ball.\n
I love Pokémon!\cThat's why I started--and why I'll keep\non collecting Pokémon!\c
How could you do this to me?\n
What else do I like besides Pokémon?\cMary, on the radio. I bet she's cute!\n
Hey! Do you have any rare Pokémon?\c
Oh, my poor Pokémon! Darlings!\n
I'd be happy just to own a single\nrare Pokémon.\n
I've been waiting!\nDid you bring any rare Pokémon\rwith you?\c
Would you get this?\cSome red-haired kid made fun of my\nprecious Pokémon!\cHumph! My Pokémon's great!\c
My NIDOKING was outstanding!\n
It's OK for people to like different\ntypes of Pokémon.\cPokémon isn't just about having the\nmost powerful one.\n
Are you going to Lake of Rage, too?\nLet's play for a little while!\c
I played too much!\n
I'm having a picnic with Pokémon.\nWon't you join us?\n
Hey, you're here!\nLet's play!\c
Do you know about the legendary\nbird Pokémon?\c
Whew! You're hot stuff.\n
ARTICUNO, ZAPDOS, and MOLTRES are the\nthree legendary bird Pokémon.\cI heard there are other legendary\nbirds, though.\n
How has it been?\nDid you see the legendary Pokémon?\c
I can tell you're a good Trainer by\nlooking at you.\cI'm good at Pokémon, and I can see that\nyou are, too.\c
Tch! It's a total loss on my part.\n
Wow. You have a lot of Badges.\nNo wonder you're so tough.\cI wonder if Ecruteak Gym's Morty is\nstill in training?\rHe really hammered me.\n
You look strong.\cGood Trainers seek tough opponents\ninstinctively.\c
Nope! This won't do at all.\n
We all get better by experiencing many\nbattles. I battled a lot to become what\rI am today--an elite.\n
I'm gonna win for sure!\c
Arrgh... That's a shocking loss...\n
It's important to have conviction on\nyour side.\n
Aack! You made me lose a POLIWAG!\nWhat are you going to do about it?\c
Just forget about it.\n
That POLIWAG that got away...\nIt was huge.\cI swear it must've been 82 feet long!\n
Hey! I've been waiting for you!\c...Oops, maybe I shouldn't yell so loud.\nThe POLIWAG ran away...\c
I fish until I can't anymore.\nI also battle until I drop.\rThat's my relationship with my Pokémon.\c
Hmmmm... This isn't right.\n
That's 100 wins to 101 losses.\cI won't battle again for a while.\n
I'll do anything to get my hands on\nrare Pokémon!\c
Oooh, your Pokémon are so appealing.\n
If a Pokémon has different colors than\nusual, it's more valuable.\cWhat? You mean that's not true?\n
What is your battle strategy?\nIt is foolish to use strong moves\rindiscriminately.\c
Fine. I lost.\n
I'm not for overly powerful moves.\cI want to win, but I also don't want to\nharm Pokémon.\n
What are your thoughts on\nraising Pokémon?\c
You've won my respect.\n
I see you're raising your Pokémon\nwith care.\cThe bond you build will save you in\ntough situations.\n
I was training here alone.\nBehold the result of my hard work!\c
Waaaargh!\n
This calls for extreme measures. I must\ntake to the hills and train in solitude.\n
I've been studying while waiting for you\nto come back...\cLet me show you the results!\c
Be prepared for anything!\rLet me see if your Pokémon have been\nraised properly!\c
Oh, I lost that!\n
I'll head back to Blackthorn's Ice Path\nand train some more.\n
Yo! You're tough! But you know what?\nWhen it comes to sheer toughness,\rI'm the man!\c
My Pokémon weren't tough enough!\n
Boy, do I love HP Up! Mmmm, yum!\cI keep drinking my Pokémon's!\nI can't help it!\n
My Pokémon are power packed!\c
Wahahah!\nI'm the big loser!\n
I'm not much good at thinking, see?\nSo I just plow ahead with power!\n
I've been waiting!\c
Why do I climb mountains?\nBecause they're there.\cWhy do I train Pokémon?\nBecause they're there!\c
Losses...\nThey're there, too!\n
The best thing ever to happen to me was\ndiscovering Pokémon.\n
I'm raising Pokémon, too!\nWill you battle with me?\c
Wha...?\n
I did my best but came up short.\nNo excuses--I admit I lost.\n
Awright! I'll show you the power of\nmountain Pokémon!\c
Mercy! You showed me your power!\n
It's over. I don't mind. We Hikers are\nlike that.\n
I raise Pokémon, too!\nWill you battle with me?\c
Oh, bleah!\n
If you've promised to have a rematch,\nyour opponent's location will be marked\rwith an “!” on the map.\cYou can check it on your Pokégear.\n
Hey, have you gone and visited many\nGyms since then?\c
Oh, you are truly strong.\n
Oh, so close! I almost had you.\n
I don't have any Pokémon left...\n
Oh, you are wonderful...\n
Ooh, you're good at Pokémon, too.\n
Looks like I lost...\n
If a Trainer spots another Trainer,\nhe or she has to make a challenge.\rThat is our destiny.\c
Whew...\nGood battle.\n
Pokémon and their Trainer become\npowerful through constant battling.\n
The red GYARADOS?\nThat sounds scary.\rIt must be red with rage!\rMe?\cI'm not angry or anything, but\nlet's battle!\c
Good going!\n
Come to think of it, I've seen a\npink BUTTERFREE.\n
Let me battle with the Pokémon\nI just caught!\c
I might be an expert angler, but I stink\nas a Pokémon Trainer...\n
I won't lose as an angler! I catch\nPokémon all day.\n
No matter what I do, all I catch are\nthe same Pokémon...\c
My line's all tangled up...\n
Why can't I catch any good Pokémon?\n
Are you alone?\nThen let's battle!\c
That's too much to handle!\n
I wonder if there are any mountains\nworth climbing in Kanto?\n
I'm going to Kanto to put on\nfire-breathing shows!\c
Fizzle... The flame's tiny...\n
I guess fire is weak on the sea...\nIt doesn't matter? Really?\n
Hey, kid! Want to battle with me?\c
You're strong!\n
You're traveling all alone?\nIsn't your mom worried?\n
You think I'm a baby?\nThat's not fair!\c
Oh! We lost!
Baby is a rude name to call someone!
You've got only one Pokémon?\nThen I'm not battling with you.
I'm not a baby!\nThat's not a nice thing to say!\c
Oh! We lost!\n
Sometimes, kids are smarter\nthan grown-ups!\n
If you don't bring more Pokémon, then\nyou can't play with everyone.\n
Urrf...\nI'm seasick!\c
I can't move anymore...\n
No more ships for me. Next time, I'm\ntaking the Magnet Train.\n
Nothing beats a battle when I'm on\nmy break.\c
Win or lose, my break's over!\n
I guess I can't win if I don't\nget serious.\n
I'm so bored.\nWant to battle?\c
Yow! You're too strong!\n
Saffron, Celadon... I hear there are\nmany big cities in Kanto.\n
Oh, no. I've lost something that's\nvery important.\c
I...I can't find it...\n
I give up. You don't have to look.\nJust forget about it!\n
I'm going to Kanto to test my skills.\c
I wanted to win!\n
Trainers from Johto can battle with\nKanto Gym Leaders.\n
I'm training to become the Champion!\c
What's so different between us?\n
I'm going to beat you someday!\n
I'm trying to forget my woes.\nLet's battle!\c
My heart weeps...\n
A voyage is best for getting over a\nbroken heart. But a Fast Ship trip is\rtoo short for grieving.\n
Ssh! My brain is picking up\nradio signals!\c
...I hear something!\n
It seems that Johto's radio shows\ntalk about Kanto when you are\rin Kanto...\n
What kinds of Poké Balls do you have\nwith you?\c
Wait! Stop! Don't!\nPlease!\n
You should use the right Poké Balls to\nfit the situation.\n
I'm building up my legs by bracing\nagainst the ship's rocking!\c
Rocked and rolled over!\n
I couldn't find the Karate King in\nJohto. He's supposed to be training in a\rcave somewhere.\n
Even though we're out on the sea,\nI can't fish! This is boring!\rLet's battle!\c
I...I'm not bored anymore...\n
I plan to fish off Vermilion's pier.\n
This is where we sailors work!\c
I lost on my home field...\n
We get different passengers from\nVermilion City to Olivine City.\n
Yeehaw!\nLucky!\c
How unlucky!\nI lost!\n
I found a pretty coin here. \nSomeone must have lost it...\n
Do you know Mary?\nShe's a popular DJ in Johto.\c
Gyaaaah!\n
Mary's the best!\nI want to be a DJ, too!\n
I'm visiting my grandma to catch me\nsome bugs!\c
Ooh, wow!\nYou're tough!\n
I'll catch all the Pokémon you can find\nonly in Johto!\n
I'm going to audition my songs at\nGoldenrod's Radio Tower.\c
Yowza!\nTotal distortion!\n
Speaking of the Radio Tower, what is\nBuena's password for today?\n
What do you think? My Pokémon are\nbeautiful, yes?\c
Oh, no! My beautiful Pokémon!\n
I must take them to the Pokémon Salon\nand get them fixed up nice!\n
I'm going to shop at the Dept. Store\nand then...\c
What was I going to do?\n
Oh, yes! I have to get my Pokémon out\nof Day Care!\n
Don't lay a finger on my students!\c
Aaack!\n
We're on a school trip to the ruins\noutside Violet.\n
Do you know the Ruins of Alph?\c
Yaargh!\n
Radios pick up strange signals inside\nthe ruins.\n
There are some odd stone panels in the\nRuins of Alph.\c
I was taken down!\n
I read that there are four of those\nstone panels.\n
I'm a sailor man!\cBut I'm training Pokémon, so I can\nbecome the Champion!\c
My lack of training is obvious...\n
Those Badges you're carrying...\nLet me guess.\cThose are the ones you get when you\ndefeat Gym Leaders, right?\cThat means you're pretty strong!\n
We stand guard in this tower.\cHere, we express our gratitude to\nshow our respect for all Pokémon.\c
Th-thank you!\n
All living beings coexist through\ncooperation.\cWe must always be thankful for this.\n
However hard we battle, the tower will\nstand strong.\c
I fought hard, but I'm too weak.\n
The flexible pillar protects the tower,\neven from earthquakes.\n
I train to find enlightenment\nin Pokémon!\c
This little squirt sure made me hurt!\n
As Pokémon grow stronger, so does\nthe Trainer.\cNo, wait. As the Trainer grows\nstronger, so do the Pokémon.\n
Let me see how much you trust\nyour Pokémon.\c
Yes, your trust is real!\n
It is not far to the Elder.\n
I sway like leaves in the wind...\c
Oh, I'm weak!\n
I tried to copy BELLSPROUT's gentle\nmovements for battle...\cBut I didn't train well enough.\n
The Elder's TM lights even\npitch-black darkness.\c
It is my head that is bright!\n
Let there be light on your journey.\n
So good of you to come here!\cSprout Tower is a place of training.\nPeople and Pokémon test their bonds\rto build a bright future together.\rI am the final test.\cAllow me to check the ties between\nyou and your Pokémon!
Ah, excellent!\n
You and your Pokémon should have no\nproblem using this move.\cTake this Flash TM.\n
I'm practicing my fire breathing in the\nBurned Tower! Don't try this at home!\c
Pfooosh... Pfooosh... Pffffoooom...\n
Oops, please don't misunderstand!\nI'm not the reason that this tower is\rburned up!\n
Don't worry!\nWe fire-breathers know the true power\rof fire better than anyone!\c
Thanks for such a heated battle!\n
The reason this tower's burned is\nthat it was hit by lightning.\cThe fire I'm breathing is tiny\nin comparison...\n
We adore our Pokémon, even if they\ndislike us. That's what being a\rPokéfan is all about.\c
M-my Pokémon!\n
I lost the battle, but my Pokémon win\nthe prize for being the most lovely.\n
My Pokémon is simply darling.\nLet me tell you how proud my\rdarling makes me.\c
I can beat you in pride, but...\n
I must say, your Pokémon are quite\ncute, too.\n
I've been waiting here to brag to you\nabout my Pokémon!\c
Hello? Why are you staring at me?\cOh, a battle?\c
...Hmmm...\n
I thought I did something wrong\nbecause you kept staring at me.\n
What?\nStaring at people's faces.\c...Oh, didn't I make a promise to\nsomeone? Was that you?\c
The world is deep. There are still lots\nof things we don't know.\rBut I know more than you do!\c
Wh-wh-what?\n
There is a lot to learn.\cFor example...\nThere are more than 90 kinds of TMs.\rAnd traded Pokémon level up faster.\n
Yay!\nYou kept your promise and came back!\c
Y-you're strong...\n
Three years ago, Team Rocket was\nforced to disband.\cBut we're making a comeback here!\c
Gwah! Don't get cute!\n
We won't let you ruin our plans for\nour comeback!\n
We're Team Rocket!\nWe like to cause trouble!\cOoh! Are you scared?\c
You think you're a hero?\n
We're not always evil. We just do\nwhatever we like.\n
Hey, hey! Keep out of our way!\c
Arggh. I give up.\n
Our Executives are trying to take this\nplace over. They have some big plan.\rI wonder what it is.\n
Ha ha ha!\rHow boring. It was far too easy to take\nover this place!\cCome on, keep me amused!\c
Wh-who are you?\n
You beat me, and I won't forget it!\n
An unknown child wandering here?\nWho are you?\c
Tch! I took you too lightly!\n
Bwahahaha...\cI can transmit as strong a signal as\nI need from here.\n
I've been given strict orders.\cI'm to crush anyone who challenges\nTeam Rocket!\c
!!!\n
I failed in my duties...\nI'll be docked pay for this...\n
It feels great ordering Pokémon to\ncommit crimes.\c
You're kidding!\n
I feel lousy over losing! Bah!\nI hate useless Pokémon!\n
Why did the door open? Did you have\nsomething to do with this?\c
Gulp! This is a bleak moment.\n
What?! You made it past our men in\nthe Underground? How could you have?\n
Proton: Now, wait just one second!\cAren't you the one who got in\nour way at the SLOWPOKE Well?\cI see... You're doing all this because\nyou want to make me angry. Be careful!\cBut since you seem to wish it, I'll show\nyou the full extent of a Team Rocket\rExecutive's wrath!\c
Seriously, you'd chase me this far?!\n
Ugh... What are you?!\n
Phew...\n
Proton: You may have won this time...\nBut all you did was make Team Rocket's\rwrath grow...\n
Most excellent!\cThis Radio Tower will fulfill our\ngrand design.\c
Hmmm...\nAll grand plans come with snags.\n
Do you honestly believe you can stop\nTeam Rocket?\n
You plan to rescue the Director?\nSo sad that won't be possible--\rbecause I'm going to beat you!\c
No! Unbelievable!\n
I do not believe it! I was beaten!\n
Oh, no! They're so useless!\n
What? Am I losing?\n
Hey, wait, are you serious?!\n
OK, OK. I'll tell you where he is.\n
Ariana: Hey, you...\nRemember me from the hideout in\rMahogany Town?\cThis time...\cHee hee hee. This time...it looks like\nyou're really all alone. All alone...\cSo it should be quite easy.\nBring it! Let's finish this!\c\n
Hey, what do you think you're doing?!\n
Wh... Wha... Why are you so strong?!\n
Aaaieeeee!\nThis can't be happening!\cI fought hard, but I still lost...\n
What a waste...\nnot to use your strength to do\rbad things!\cFeh... People like you will never in a\nmillion years understand our brilliance!\cIt's too bad... I've really come to\nrespect your strength.\n
We can't have you getting in the way\nbefore news of our resurgence\rreaches Giovanni!\n
That's impossible...\n
No!\nForgive me, Giovanni!\n
Hmmm...\nThis is a strange place.\c
...\n
I like thinking here.\n
ZUBAT's Supersonic keeps confusing my\nPokémon. I'm seriously upset\rabout that!\c
I flamed out!\n
I've practiced training my Pokémon,\nbut I've practiced breathing fire many\rmore times than that.\cDon't try this at home, OK?\n
If there's light, a cave isn't scary. If\nyou're strong, Pokémon aren't scary.\c
FLASH!\n
It's my Pokémon's fire that lights up\nthis cave.\n
I roam far and wide in search of\nPokémon.\cAre you looking for Pokémon, too?\nThen you're my collecting rival!\c
Ugh. My poor Pokémon...\n
Every Friday, you can hear Pokémon\nroars from deep inside the cave.\n
You're headed to Azalea, are you?\nLet my Pokémon see if you are good\renough to battle.\c
Oh, oh, oh!\n
All right, then! I've decided.\cI'm not leaving until my Pokémon\nget tougher!\n
Whoa! What a surprise!\nI didn't expect to see anyone here!\c
Whoa! I'm beaten big time!\n
I was conned into buying a\nSlowpokeTail. I feel sorry for the\rpoor Pokémon.\n
Who's there?\nLeave me and my Pokémon alone!\c
Go...\nGo away!\n
Just me and my Pokémon.\nI'm delirious with joy.\n
I came all the way here to conduct my\nPokémon research.\cLet me demonstrate my findings in a\nreal battle!\c
I'm the one who learned something from\nyour demonstration!\n
I should compile and announce my study\nfindings. I might even become famous\rlike Professor Elm.\n
It's been a while since I last saw\nanother person.\cDon't be shy. Let's battle!\c
Uurggh...\n
I've been lost for a long time...\cI don't mind it here, but I am\nsoooo hungry!\n
What do you know!\nA visitor!\c
Wa ha ha! You're a feisty one!\n
I live down here.\nIf you like, you can always come visit!\n
There are two kinds of people:\nthose with style and those without.\cWhich kind of person are you?\c
You've got dazzling style!\n
Your Pokémon style is stunning and\nfull of life, I admit.\cYou'll just keep getting better!\n
I'm in training.\nCare for a round?\c
Aww, no! You're too good for me.\n
I'm going to train by myself until\nI improve.\n
If the Pokémon I liked were there,\nI'd go anywhere.\cThat's what a real Trainer does.\c
I'd rather pet my Pokémon than battle!\n
Just once a week, a Pokémon comes to\nthe water's edge.\cI wanted to see that Pokémon...\n
It doesn't matter where we go, there's\nalways someone who doesn't agree\rwith us...\n
Are you serious? Did you come here\nthinking you could mess with our plans?\n
Grr...\nFor a kid to be this good...\rI didn't see it coming.\n
Quit taking SlowpokeTails?\cIf we listened to you, Team Rocket's\nrep would be ruined!\c
Just...\nToo strong...\n
We need the money, but selling\nSlowpokeTails?\cIt's tough being a Team Rocket Grunt!\n
Humph! I was standing guard up top\nwhen some old coot yelled at me.\cHe startled me so much that I fell\ndown here.\cHow about I vent my anger and take it\nout on you!\c
Arrgh! This is NOT my day!\n
Sure, we've been hacking the tails off\nSLOWPOKE and selling them.\cTeam Rocket will do anything for money!\n
Stop taking SlowpokeTails?\cWhat?! You want us to disobey a direct\norder from Executive Proton?\cIf you want to stop us, you'll have to\ndefeat us all! Go ahead and try!\c
You rotten brat!\n
SlowpokeTails grow back fast!\cBesides, it was an order from Proton,\nso I'm more concerned about that!\n
What are you here for? Just to stand\naround and gawk? I suggest you leave!\c
You really are concerned...\n
How in the world do you go up?\cI want to visit the sick Pokémon, but I\ncan't get up there...\n
We're pretty high up here. My bird\nPokémon are in prime form.\c
Oops...\nThey crashed...\n
My bird Pokémon trained in Cianwood.\nSince I've lost, maybe we'll go across\rthe sea.\n
I travel the world to train my Pokémon.\nNow, I wish to battle with you.\c
...Aww... I must train some more...\n
Jasmine used to use Rock Pokémon\nlike ONIX.\n
Eh? This is no place for playing.\c
Ah! I can see you're serious.\n
Up top is a Pokémon that keeps the\nLighthouse lit.\cPokémon glow when they are healthy,\njust like people.\n
Hey, you're back!\c
Jasmine is this city's Gym Leader.\nI intend to bring her back with me.\cNobody better get in my way!\c
Aaack! My Pokémon!\n
Right. Anybody would be worried if his or\nher own Pokémon were hurt.\n
Men of the sea are always spoiling for a\ngood fight!\c
Urf!\nI lose!\n
What power! How would you like to sail\nthe seas with me?\n
Hey, you're back!\nJust in time for me to show off!\c
Sailors are both kind and strong.\nHow about you?\c
You are both kind and strong...\n
Every time I come back to Olivine,\nI visit the Gym.\cThe Gym Leader's Pokémon type\nchanged without my noticing.\n
Jasmine must be worried sick about the\nPokémon here. She won't even smile\rthese days.\c
I can't manage a smile, either...\n
Speaking of being sick, I've heard\nthere's a good Pharmacy in Cianwood.\n
I wanted to battle Jasmine, but she's\nnot up to it now. So how about you?\c
Whoa, whoa. You're overwhelming!\n
Being a Gym Leader isn't just about\nbeing strong. A Leader also needs to\rbe compassionate.\n
This was once a ninja hideout.\cThere are traps to confound intruders\nlike you.\c
I see...\n
The PC on my desk is the switch\nthat deactivates the PERSIAN\ralarm system.\cDon't you ever touch it, OK?\n
Heh heh. Feeling lucky, punk?\cGo ahead, take another step.\nWe've got explosives set in the floor!\rStep on one, and--BOOM!\c
Kaboom!\n
Where are the traps planted?\nThat... Well...\cI don't even remember!\n
Grr... I failed...\n
Surveillance cams are in the\nPokémon statues.\cWe'll keep appearing until you trip a\nsecret switch.\n
Argh! I'm getting nervous!\n
Eeek!\n
Tch, you really are strong.\cIt's too bad. If you were to join Team\nRocket, you could become an Executive.\n
The door won't open?\cWell, duh. It has to have a password\nthat only Team Rocket knows.\c
What? I lost?\n
Heh, I'm just a Team Rocket Grunt.\nI don't know the password.\rToo bad for you.\n
Oh, a kid? I don't really like this, but\neliminate you I must.\c
I knew I'd lose...\n
I got wiped out on the last mission by a\nkid, too. When we were abducting\rPokémon, this kid with long red hair and\rmean-looking eyes just whomped me...\n
You rotten little pest!\c
Grrrr...\n
Heh, only the one who guards the boss's\nroom knows the password for that door.\cWhere's the boss's room?\nWho knows? Go look for yourself.\n
...\n
Hey, you're good!\n
Wow, strong!\n
I...I couldn't do a thing...\nGiovanni, please forgive me...\n
I used to work for Silph, but now I run\nresearch for Team Rocket.\cA meddlesome child like you needs to be\npunished.\c
A mere tactical error cost me...\n
A radio signal that drives Pokémon\nmad... My experiment is a complete\rsuccess. My promotion is assured.\rThis loss means absolutely nothing.\n
I don't care that Pokémon are hurt by\nour experiment.\c
Thinking is my strong suit, not battling.\n
If we turn up the power of our radio\nsignal for broadcast nationwide...\cThe very thought excites me!\n
Hyuck-hyuck-hyuck!\cYou're challenging me to a battle?\nHah! You're nuts, but you have guts!\cI like that! If you can beat me, I'll\ntell you a password to the boss's room!\c
The password for the boss's door--\cRATICATETAIL.\n
The password for the boss's door--\nRATICATETAIL.\cBut if you don't have both passwords...\nHa ha ha!\n
Do I know the password?\cMaybe.\cBut no weakling's going to get it!\c
The password for the boss's door--\cSLOWPOKETAIL.\n
The password to the boss's room is\nSLOWPOKETAIL.\cBut it's useless unless you have two\npasswords.\n
My Pokémon just got a haircut!\nI'll show you how strong it is!\c
Aiyeeee!\n
Your Pokémon will like you more if you\ngive them haircuts.\n
I think you have some rare Pokémon\nwith you. Let me see them!\c
Gah! I lost!\nThat makes me mad!\n
Are you making a Pokédex?\nHere's a hot tip.\cYou want to battle as many Trainers as\nyou can when you see them on routes\rand in caves.\cTheir Pokémon will be recorded in the\nPokédex, and they'll also make your\rPokémon grow!\n
I got booted out of the Game Corner.\nI kept winning at the new Coin game,\rand they thought I was cheating...\c
...Grumble...\n
I guess I have to do things fair\nand square...\n
Do you consider the Pokémon types\nin battle?\cIf you know about the different types\nof Pokémon, you'll do better in battle.\c
Ow, ow, ow!\n
I know all the different types\nof Pokémon.\rBut I only use one type.\n
Fork over your goods!\c
Mercy!\n
Steal and sell!\nThat's basic in crime, kid!\n
They ditched this project before\nthey finished.\rI'm searching for leftover loot.\c
So strong...\n
The underground warehouse?\cWhat do you want to go there for?\nThere's nothing down there.\n
Open one door, another closes. Bet you\ncan't get where you want to go!\c
Uh-oh! I was sunk by indecision!\n
I'm confused, too...\cI'm pretty sure that the green switch\nis the one to press last... I think?\n
I don't care if you're lost. You show up\nhere--you're nothing but a victim!\c
Urk! Yeah, think you're cool, huh?\n
You must have ice in your veins to\ncall out Team Rocket.\n
Kwa ha ha!\cConfounded by the doors, are we?\cI'll let you in on a secret if you can\nbeat me!\c
Uwww...\nI blew it.\n
All right. A hint!\cLook at the color of the door switches.\nYou push a color switch, and the same\rcolor door opens up...\n
Are you lost? No, you can't be.\nYou don't have that scared look. I'll\rgive you something to be scared about!\c
How could you?\n
Go wherever you like! Get lost!\nSee if I care!\n
You're not going any farther!\nI don't show mercy to my enemies,\respecially not brats!\c
Blast it!\n
I lost...\cPlease forgive me, Giovanni!\n
Hyuck-hyuck-hyuck!\nI remember you!\cYou got me good at our hideout!\c
Hyuck-hyuck-hyuck!\nSo that's how you did it!\n
Hyuck-hyuck-hyuck!\nThat was a blast!\n
How did you get this far? I guess it\ncan't be helped. I'll dispose of you.\c
I got disposed of...\n
Team Rocket will keep going, waiting for\nthe return of Giovanni.\cWe'll do whatever it takes.\n
Waaaarggh!\nI'm beaten!\n
You! How dare you enter uninvited!\c
S-strong!\n
The Shrine ahead is home to the Master\nof our Dragon Tamer clan.\cYou're not allowed to just go in!\n
You shouldn't be in here!\c
Oh yikes, I lost!\n
Soon I'm going to get permission from\nour Master to use dragons.\cWhen I do, I'm going to become an\nadmirable Dragon Tamer and gain our\rMaster's approval.\n
It's a stranger--someone we\ndon't know.\c
Ouchies.\n
It was like having to battle Lance.\n
We fight as a team. Come back later with\nmore Pokémon.\n
Who are you?\c
Meanie.\n
We'll tell on you.\cMaster will be angry with you.\n
You don't have enough Pokémon.\nCome back when you have more.\n
...!\n
...\n
Welcome to Viridian Forest.\nEnjoy my Bug-type Pokémon!\c
That's wonderful...\n
Pretty impressive!\cI'm sure you can go anywhere with\nthat skill!\n
Shh! Be quiet!\nThe bug Pokémon will run away!\c
Phew...\n
From Bug-type Pokémon come the sounds\nof munching on grass, walking on\rcrunchy leaves, swimming in puddles...\cFor bug Pokémon fans, knowing how to\ndistinguish these sounds is key!\n
Wow, that's a HUGE Pokémon!\c...\n...What kind of Trainer?!\c
I couldn't catch it!\n
Has anyone ever told you that from\nbehind you look like a VENONAT?\n
I'm sure that there's nothing more\nefficient and beautiful in this world\rthan a Bug-type Pokémon.\c
I lost beautifully!\n
If this is it, then I don't mind losing!\n
There are many people out there who\nprefer solid bug Pokémon over squishy\rbug Pokémon.\c
Thanks for your hard work,\nmy lovely Pokémon...\n
Doesn't matter what kind of Pokémon--\ras long as you like them, they all\nlook cute.\n\n
What did you come all the way out here\nfor, I wonder.\c
I lost all the way out here...\n
Trainers are everywhere.\n
Hey, hey, you're in my way!\nRight!\c
I got kicked around...\n
All right, please pass through!\n
To beat the cold, try warm clothes and\na hot drink!\c
Argh, all the way out here!\n
That was a hot battle!\n
How do I feel about losing?\nIt hurts!\n
I'm not done measuring data!\n
I-I didn't win.\n
It's pure white in my head!\n
Argh... I can't do any more...\n
Argh!\n
You!\nI've been waiting for someone like you!\c
Yep, just as strong as expected!\n
That was a great fight!\nDon't you agree?\n
Right after learning it in class, I head\noutside to practice!\c
I need to follow the textbook.\n
I should be sure to record all of\ntoday's mistakes in a notebook!\n
My Bag is digging into my shoulders!\nWhen that happens, I like to take a\rbreak and have a battle!\c
Feh.\n
All right, guess I should carry my\nBag again!\n
How about you just slow down\nand give me the chance to defeat you!\c
Looks like I've been beaten at my\nown game...\n
Even though you're so young, you\nhave the spirit of battle within.\cYou must have trained under a\nwell-known master!\n
Zac: Really, you want to battle us?\nYou've got a lot of courage for someone\rso young.\c
Zac: You weren't bluffing...\n
Zac: Your future looks promising.\n
Zac: You... Please come back with\nmore Pokémon.\n
Jen: Huh? You'd like to go up against\nus? Great!\c
Jen: You're so much stronger than\nI thought.\n
Jen: I'm looking forward to seeing what\nkind of Trainer you'll become.\n
Jen: If you're looking to battle us,\nyou have to have at least two Pokémon.\n
Wait a moment! Come fight us!\c
You did it...\n
You came all the way from Johto?\nYou must be very persistent!\n
Peace!\c...\n...Huh?\cWhen you meet the unknown on a\nmountain road, all you want is peace,\rright?\c
Peace--even though I lost!\n
Exchanging lighthearted greetings with\nsomeone you don't know...\cThat's the best thing about mountains!\n
Youngster? Goodness, how rude!\nCall me Shorts Boy!\c
That is...Fail Boy...\n
Looks like I need a bit more training!\n
Moe: Do I look weak?\nDon't make me laugh!\rWhen I'm with Lulu, I've got a hundred\rtimes more courage!\c
Moe: Uwaaaahhh...\n
Moe: In short, you're just\ntoo strong...\n
Moe: You don't have enough Pokémon to\nfight with us.\n
Lulu: Moe and I make a great pair! You\nshould prepare yourself!\c
Lulu: Eeek!\n
Lulu: Don't you misunderstand this!\nIt's not that Moe's weak, it's that\ryou're too strong!\n
Lulu: Uh-oh, you've got only one\nPokémon. You can't battle with us\rlike that!\n
I am but a Gentleman stopped on the\nroad. Would you care to join me in a\rquick contest?\c
You were very skillful.\n
Stopping in the road for a battle isn't\nrude. No matter what, I am a\rGentleman first!\n
Huh? The wind has changed direction!\c
Phew...\n
Since the wind has changed,\nI'll lay low...\n
BASABASABASABASABASA!\c
Pyopyopyopyo...\n
Chuun-Chuun? Chunchun!\n
Vic: All right! I'll be able to show off\nfor Tara!\c
Vic: Oh no, my plans!\n
Vic: Tara's already seen\nme humiliated...\n
Vic: What is it? You want to battle?\nIf you want to battle with us, you need\rmore Pokémon, right?\n
Tara: I love to look at my boyfriend's\nface in profile while he's battling!\c
Tara: Oh no, oh no...\n
Tara: Even though my boyfriend lost,\nhe's still wonderful.\n
Tara: Oh? You've got only one Pokémon?\nOK, we'll try again another time.\n
Pokémon battles lure people in!\c
My Pokémon bucket is empty!\n
Really? Rather than always catching new\nPokémon, it's good to train them?\n\n
It was nice talking to you, but now I'm\nhere for a Pokémon battle!\c
Tim: I'll give you a little hint.\cDon't you think my girlfriend's much\nstronger than I am?\c
Tim: You're the strongest!\n
Tim: If you've beaten her, you must\nbe strong!\n
Tim: Are you collecting Pokémon? You\ncan't fight us with just one Pokémon.\n
Tim: Hey, you came back! \nWhile we were waiting for you, we became\rmuch stronger!\cWell, she did.\c
Sue: Women who don't take love\nseriously and who are reckless might\rget hurt.\c
Sue: Wa ha...\n
Sue: That strength of yours...\cI've got it! Are you in love?\n
Sue: Let's have a Pokémon battle after\nyou've gotten more than one Pokémon.\n
Sue: A woman in love is impatient.\cBut if she's with her boyfriend,\nwaiting is never a chore!\c
Collect water!\nDon't let the fire go out!\rLook out for wild Pokémon!\rLet's go, Campfire!\c
Pfuuuuhh...\n
It doesn't matter what kind of\npreparation you've done.\rIf you lose, you lose.\n
I can fit in a quick battle while I'm in\nthe midst of preparing a meal!\c
Oh, I'm hungry...\n
I figured it would be easy to knock\nyou out...\n
Hey, you're back! I haven't eaten\nanything while I waited!\c
Hey, hey, how about we bring out your\nPokémon and mine for a battle?\c
Oh, that's too bad...\n
The way you were walking with your\nPokémon made me think that I could win.\n
Why is it I always get the urge to\nwhistle when walking through nature?\c
Tweeee!\n
Instead of communicating with Pokémon\nwith words, you can communicate with\rthem through whistling!\n
All right, let's get this Pokémon\nbattle started!\c
All right!\nThat concludes today's battle.\n
Don't relax just 'cause you won.\nOnce you get home, you should do a\rfull review!\n
My weight puts me in the\nfeatherweight class!\c...Huh? What do you mean that\ndoesn't sound very strong?\c
I lost as lightly as a feather floats!\n
Maybe I should lie and say I'm in the\nheavyweight class...\n
I'm a stubborn featherweight.\nI've been waiting here for you!\c
I can't wait to go home and drop off\nmy Bag!\c
I was in too much of a hurry.\n
Don't rush, and take the road one step\nat a time. Great advice!\n
It's good to put what you learn to\nuse immediately!\c
I see. I see.\n
All right!\nNext time, I won't make any mistakes!\n
I've made good use of the time I've\nbeen waiting and done a review!\c
Do you have after-school\nstudy sessions?\c
So strong...\n
Maybe I should join your\nstudy sessions!\n
We're the twins Kay and Tia!\nDo you know which one I am?\c
Tia and Kay both lost...\n
Absolute truth--I'm Kay! Maybe...\n
If you want to battle with us,\nyou'll need to bring more Pokémon!\n
While you weren't looking, Kay and Tia\nchanged places.\c
We're the twins Kay and Tia!\nDo you know which one I am?\c
Kay and Tia both lost...\n
Maybe truth--I'm Tia! Absolutely!\n
If you want to battle with us,\nyou'll need to bring more Pokémon!\n
While you weren't looking, Tia and Kay\nchanged places.\c
Hey, your Pokémon...\nShow me. Show me. Show me!\c
Yay! That was great!\n
When you battle Pokémon, you get to\nsee a bunch of Pokémon you've never\rseen before. It's so great!\n
All right, Pokémon, time for a battle!\c
Oh, well...\n
It's not that my Pokémon are weak!\nIt's that your Pokémon are too strong!\n
You're gonna lose!\nI've got a hunch!\c
Maybe my hunch was a little off...\n
You're so cool!\nYou don't do anything halfway!\n
Modding my Bike costs a bunch of money!\nI need a job!\c
Argh. I failed!\n
Bike?\nOh, I was talking about my Bicycle!\n
Hey, who told you you could ride up\nand down this road?\c
Crash!\n
See you later! Come back anytime!\n
Hey! Do you think you could just pass\nthrough here without stopping?\c
Parara parapara para-parara!\cMy horn's got a great melody to it,\ndon't you think?\c
Paaraaraaaaa...\n
I love this melancholy melody.\nIt really suits me well...\n
I'll toughen you up.\nNow, you come along with me.\c
All right, thanks!\n
All right! That fighting yell was great!\n
Hey hey hey!\nYou're in my way! IN MY WAY!\c
I lost. I lost!\n
Won't you give it a try? Would you like\nto join my team?\n
Hey, that's a cool Bike\nyou're riding!\c
Great job.\n
I love the way you do battle, too!\nConsider me a fan!\n
Vroom vroom!\nBaribaribaribaribari!\rWhat do you think of my engine imitation?\c
Hnnff...hnnff... I'm out of breath...\n
We don't put out any exhaust fumes.\nWe're a biker club that's kind\rto nature!\n
Gaon gaooon!\nBuwaribaribaribari...!\rThere, my engine imitation has evolved!\c
Have you ever gone camping\nwith Pokémon?\c
You're strong!\n
If you forget your blanket when you go\ncamping, you can snuggle up to a\rPokémon and it'll be just as warm!\n
Are you in a hurry?\nHow about a quick battle break?\c
Aaahh...that's it.\n
Even though I lost, I had fun!\n
When I was a kid, I only played inside\nthe house.\cNow I love playing outside with Pokémon!\c
Argh!\n
If I'm with Pokémon, I don't mind losing\nso much!\n
Found it! A Trainer that I can\nenjoy fighting!\c
I lost with all my strength!\n
That was an incredible battle!\nI've got goose bumps!\n
Hey, hey. Will you battle me?\c
That was pretty incredible.\n
You're something special!\n
I used to be a fisherman a while back.\cI've grown to love swimming so much,\nI'm always in my swim trunks!\c
Ulp...\n
Maybe I should go back to fishing...\n
Phew!\nI've worn my best swim trunks today!\c
Even if you're wearing your best pants,\nif you don't win--you just don't win.\n
All right! Next time I'll wear party\nswim trunks!\n
Look! It's my very best swimsuit\nand my very best Pokémon!\c
Ohhh!\n
Your Pokémon--are you following the\nlatest trend in teams?\n
Mmph? Mmmph mmmmphh?\nMmmmph mmmmmppphh!!!\c
Pwah!\n
I was trying to see how long I could\nhold my breath!\n
Huh? I've caught a Trainer\ninstead of a Pokémon!\c
My fishing line got cut!\n
It's said that the Pokémon that\nescaped were huge. It's the truth!\n
Whoa! A nibble!\c...Huh?\nA battle? OK, let's go!\c
If you try to chase two Pokémon,\nyou won't catch either one!\n
I should've asked you to wait until\nI reeled that Pokémon in...\n
Question is...did I become a fisherman\nbecause I'm patient, or did I get more\rpatient because I'm a fisherman?\c
Ummm... Hmmm...\n
What's the reason you became a\nPokémon Trainer?\n
I love bikinis!\nIf I had an electric bikini, I could wear\rit even in winter!\c
Awww...\n
I suppose if you tried to swim in an\nelectric bikini, you'd get a shock!\n
Hey, Trainer! How about you put on a\nswimsuit, too?\c
I didn't want to lose...\n
I wonder if there's any place that sells\nswimsuits that suit my Pokémon?\n
The teacher from the swimming class\nwhere I learned to swim had a face just\rlike a POLIWHIRL.\c
I'm sorry, Teacher...\n
Due to the incredible resemblance,\nwe called our teacher\rProfessor POLIWHIRL!\n
Swimming is a full-body exercise, so it's\nreally good for building strength!\c
My Pokémon and I have no\nbody strength...\n
To win more, I need to work on\nmy stamina!\n
Surrounding yourself with bird Pokémon\ngives you the feeling that someday you\rmight be able to fly, too!\c
I couldn't fly...\n
I guess I just need to practice flapping\nmy wings more!\n
Bird Keepers are so wonderful with\ntheir bird Pokémon!\c
I couldn't handle it...\n
We Bird Keepers think we're using bird\nPokémon. But somewhere along the line,\rthe bird Pokémon started using us...\n\n
Day: Are you going to beat us?\c
Day: Waah!\n
Day: You beat us...\n
Day: If you want to battle Pokémon\nwith us, you'll have to bring more...\n
Dani: We'll knock you flat!\c
Dani: Eeeeh!\n
Dani: Looks like we got bounced.\n
Dani: If you want to battle Pokémon\nwith us, you'll have to bring more...\n
Walking along with luggage and your\ncompanion Pokémon gives a great feeling\rof outdoor life!\c
Yaha! I lost!\n
Are you also on a solo journey?\nSee you again sometime. Bye for now!\n
I'm headed out on a picnic. Do you\nknow why?\c
You are pretty good!\n
The reason I'm going on a picnic...\cIt's because I really want to smell\nthe fresh air...\cDo you know what I mean?\n
Hey! Hugh!\c
I mistook you for someone else...\n
I came to explore Mt. Mortar, but I got\nseparated from my partner...\cDid you run into a Trainer who uses a\nSEADRA? That SEADRA is really good at\rusing Waterfall.\n
Yo! Markus!\c
Oops!\nI really mixed you up!\n
I came to explore Mt. Mortar, but I got\nseparated from my partner...\cDid you run into a Trainer who uses a\nSLOWPOKE? That SLOWPOKE is really good\rat using Strength.\n
I'm not losing this time!\c
I lost to some kid?\n
A while back, this karate guy wanted\nto battle. He was ridiculously good.\cHe just thrashed me silly.\cHe said something about training and\nwent in deeper. I wonder why?\n
Were you really watching?\n
Duff: Watching over my girlfriend makes\nmy heart soar!\c
Duff: I was no match for you...\n
Duff: Thank you for the awe-inspiring\nbattle! Bye!\n
Duff: If you want to fight with us,\nyou'll need more than one Pokémon.\n
Eda: My heart's feelings for my\nboyfriend are as wide and deep as\rthe ocean.\c
Eda: You're really something...\n
Eda: You should really find a wonderful\npartner, too.\n
Eda: Uh-oh. You've only got\none Pokémon?\n
Thom: One plus one is two. But the two\nof us together is much stronger!\c
Thom: That wasn't what I expected...\n
Thom: It seems your power is impossible\nto predict!\n
Thom: You should carry more Pokémon\nwith you, right?\n
Kae: The two of us aren't just some\nboring pair!\c
Kae: You're unusual, too!\n
Kae: I figured you were an ordinary\nlone Trainer. Boy, was I wrong!\n
Kae: Didn't you know you need at\nleast two Pokémon to battle us?\n
Longing for others is...what it is...\cBut battles are battles, so let's go!\c
Wah ha ha!\n
After a battle, you should always leave\nwith a parting laugh!\n
I'm not good with large crowds, so\nI'm camping out here with my Pokémon!\rAre you the same way?\c
I should be headed deeper into the\nmountain, I guess...\n
See ya!\n
Did you see that, Clair?\n
Oh, I see...\n
Oh, you are a cute little Trainer!\nWhy don't you battle me?\c
You're good...\n
Oh, I've learned something. There are\npeople like you out there who are very\rskilled even though they're young...\n
Hey hey there, you young Trainer!\nWon't you battle with me?\c
Wow, you're strong...\n
You...\nI wonder what your future holds...\n
Mmmmph... I just woke up.\nI couldn't focus...\n
What in the world was that? Don't tell\nme some inexperienced kid can\rpossibly be that strong!\n
What was that?\n
What in the world are you?\n

Stop drawing funny faces!\nIt hurts to laugh so much!
Wow, you're good!\nI'll try to imitate you!
...Uh-huh... What is that?\nThat's supposed to be me?
A battle? Of course, but I need\ntime to get ready.
Thanks for waiting!\nLet's get our battle started!
Sorry! My Pokémon don't seem to\nbe feeling too well right now.\rLet me battle you another time.
If you want to battle, you need two\nPokémon that are Lv. 30 or lower.\c
Whoa!\nI can tell you're pretty tough!
You used that move?\nThat's good strategy!
Way to go!\nThat was an eye-opener!
Oh! How could you use that\nPokémon in that situation?
You want to trade, huh?\nSure, hold on just a second.
All right!\nLet's trade!
Sorry! I don't have a Pokémon I\ncan trade right now.\cLet's trade some other time.
Oh yeah!\nI really wanted this Pokémon!
Finally, I got that Pokémon\nI've wanted for such a long time.
You can't trade if you have only one\nPokémon with you.\c
If you want to do something with\nme, just give me a shout!
You want to mix records with me?\nOK, I just need a little time.
Thanks for waiting!\nLet's mix our records, then.
Oh, I'm sorry.\nI have too much to do right now.\rAnother time, OK?

You should mix records, too!
Spin Trade? Sure!\nOK, just hold on a second!
OK, all set!\nLet's do a Spin Trade!
                                        
You need an Egg if you want to take\npart in a Spin Trade.\c

Spin Trades are so much fun!
There!\nStop there!
My Egg's awesome!
Yes!\nI got the Egg I wanted!
[VAR 011C(0002,0000)][VAR 0201(000F)]\cHello, it's [VAR 0103(0000,0000)]!\nWould you like to do something?

Want to do\nsomething else?

Oops!\nI can't stay inside the lines!
A battle? Of course, but I need\ntime to get ready.

I'm terribly sorry, but my Pokémon\naren't feeling well...\cLet's battle another time.

That's it!\nThis is the right move now!
That's awesome!\nYou can battle that way?
You have exquisite timing for\nswitching Pokémon!
A trade? Of course, but I need\ntime to get ready.
Sorry I made you wait!\nLet's get started!
I'm sorry, but I don't have any\nPokémon that I can trade now...\cLet's trade some other time!
I'm trading Pokémon right now.
I finally got that Pokémon I\nwanted in a trade!
You can't trade if you have only\none Pokémon with you.\c
If you want to do something with\nme, don't be shy. Just ask!
You want to mix records?\nSure! But I need a little time!
Sorry I made you wait!\nLet's get started!
Oh, sorry!\nLet's do this another time!

There is an Egg that cannot be traded\nin your party.
We're doing Spin Trades!
Wah!\nIt moved again!
There goes the Egg I wanted...
If it stopped there, I would've gotten\na Berry.
Welcome to the Union Room.\cIf there is anything you need help\nwith, please let me know! [VAR 0200(0000)]
How may I help you? [VAR 0200(0000)]
Which topic would you\nlike me to explain? [VAR 0200(0000)]
In the Union Room, you may battle\nwith two Pokémon of your choice\rthat are Lv. 30 or lower.\cWhen you visit here, we recommend\nthat you bring Pokémon that\rmeet this requirement.\c
You may trade your Pokémon with\nother players.\cMeeting new people could be a\nshortcut to meeting rare Pokémon!\c
You may communicate with other\nplayers and mix your records.\cWhat will happen if you mix records,\nyou ask?\cWe recommend that you try it and\nsee!\cUp to five players can take part,\nso try it with your friends!\c
In a Spin Trade, participants each bring\nan Egg for trading with others.\cWhich Egg will you end up with?\nWhat kind of Pokémon is in that Egg?\rIt's quite exciting and fun!\cUp to five players can take part, so\ntry it with your friends!\c
You may get together with others\nand draw.\cYou all get to work on one sheet\nof paper at the same time.\cI'm sure a drawing made by friends\nwill be a memorable masterpiece!\cUp to five players can take part,\nso try it with your friends!\c
You can chat with other people\nby selecting “CHAT” in the menu.\cGo out and meet other players in\nthe Union Room!\cLet people know what you're like\nand what you'd like to do.\cMingle, chat, and add to your\ncircle of friends!\c
Oh!\nHere comes someone now!\cInstead of me, why not strike up\na chat with our newcomer?\c
                                  
Do you sometimes get mistaken for\na real [VAR 010E(0000,0000)]?\cI just seem to get that feeling\nfrom you.\c
Hello!\cThat's right!\nIt's important to say a greeting!\cIf someone arrives, let's try to\nbe friendly!\c
Greetings!\c[VAR 011C(0000,0000)]?\nIt's wonderful!\rI really like it, too!\cWhen you meet someone for the first\ntime, the proper etiquette is to\rintroduce yourself.\cBy introducing yourself, you'll get to\nknow about the other person, too!\c
[VAR 011C(0000,0000)] Trainer?\nThat's what you are?\rIsn't that something!\cBut I'm sorry to say, I don't have\nany Pokémon...\cI would rather watch than battle,\nyou see.\c
Oh! Your [VAR 011C(0000,0000)]!\nI would love to have it!\rPlease trade me!\c...\cI was actually joking.\cI don't have any Pokémon, so\nI can't trade with anyone...\c
[VAR 011C(0000,0000)]?\nI can understand you'd want one...\cBut you shouldn't expect people to\nmake trades just for you.\cYou also have to consider what\nPokémon the other person wants.\c
Welcome to the Union Room!\cI'm the only one here now, but\nplease do bring your friends for\rsome fun and excitement!\cIf you have time on your hands,\nI'm also here to chat.\cYou see, I have a lot of time on\nmy hands...\c
I'm quite good at drawing!\cIf it's [VAR 011C(0000,0000)],\nleave it to me!\rNo one's better than me at it!\c
Oh, you're leaving...\c...\cIt makes me feel lonesome...\cPlease do come visit again!\c
What's wrong?\nAre you feeling down about something?\cIf you're feeling blue, it's much\nbetter to have fun with friends\rthan to be alone.\c
[VAR 011C(0000,0000)]?\nYes, please!\c...I do want to join in, but I'm\non duty here, so I can't...\cSigh... [VAR 011C(0000,0000)]...\nI wish I could...\c
[VAR 011C(0000,0000)]?\nMe, too, please!\cBut I need to stay here and attend\nto our visitors...\cPlease enjoy it with your friends!\c
[VAR 011C(0000,0000)]?\nYou're inviting me?\cOh, but I have to stay here and\nattend to our visitors.\cI'm sorry. I'd love to accept,\nbut I really can't.\c
That's right!\cSometimes, it might be better to\njust go and invite other people.\cBut don't get too selfish or pushy\nbecause you want to [VAR 011C(0000,0000)].\c
Yes!\nIt's OK!\cNothing is impossible.\cThink positively and keep your\nchin up!\c
Everyone has at least one thing\nthey aren't good at.\cYou should never try to make someone\ndo what they don't want to do.\cIncidentally, [VAR 011C(0000,0000)] is\nsomething that I would like to do.\c
Good luck! I hope you enjoy\nserious battles.\cYou can't experience ones like\nthis in the Union Room!\c
You want to chat?\cWell, you shouldn't be wasting your\ntime chatting with me.\cYou need to be more active and talk\nto other players.\cAfter all, you can't make friends\nif you don't talk to people.\c
Where are you?\nUm... Right before my eyes.\cOh!\nAre you maybe an impostor?\cThe real player is somewhere else?\c...That's ridiculous!\nPlease, don't be silly!\rMy word!\c
[VAR 011C(0000,0000)] trade?\nThat sounds fun!\rI would love to as well.\cBut telling me that won't help.\nI can't trade with anyone.\c
If you want to have a [VAR 011C(0000,0000)]\nBattle, you need to be more\rassertive and talk to other players.\cIf you can't assert yourself, you\nmay never get a chance at a\r[VAR 011C(0000,0000)] Battle!\c
