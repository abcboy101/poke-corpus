Dawn: Hi, [VAR 0103(0001,0000)]!\nAre you catching Pokémon?\c
Wow! You've already got [VAR 0132(0000,0000)] Pokémon\nwith you!\cAt that pace, your Pokédex should\nbe full in no time at all!\c
...Um...\cI think you'd feel a lot safer if you\nwere to catch some more.\cYou know, like when you need to travel\nto faraway places.\c
Oh, I know! Don't you think it's\nbetter to know more about Pokémon?\cSure it is!\nI know just the place.\cCome on!\nDon't be shy. Follow me!\c
Lucas: Hey, [VAR 0103(0001,0000)]!\nHow many Pokémon have you caught?\c
Whoa! You already have [VAR 0132(0000,0000)] Pokémon\nwith you!\c
Huh?\nI think you should catch some more.\cIt might be more of a challenge\nraising a lot of Pokémon...\cBut it's worth it. The more Pokémon\nyou have, the happier you'll be.\c
Hey, that's right! Don't you think it's\nbetter to know more about Pokémon?\cSure it is!\nThere's this great place for that.\cCome on! It's all right.\nFollow me.\c
Dawn: That man...\nWhat is he doing?\c
Dawn: Um...
Lucas: That guy...\nWhat's he doing?\c
Lucas: Uh, excuse...
WHAAAT?!\c
Mysterious man: ...How did you know?\cHow did you unmask me as a member of\nthe International Police?!\c
Dawn: Huh? What? I beg your pardon?\nI was just making conversation...\c
Lucas: Huh? What? Are you kidding?\nI was just making small talk...\c
Shady man: ...Heh. You claim you were\nonly making conversation, do you?\cBut, I know better not to believe that.\nNo, no, no.\cYou recognized right away that I was\nsomeone extraordinary.\cThat is why you spoke to me, is it not?\nYour power of observation is fearsome!\cQuite admirable, you are!\c
Now that my cover has been blown, let\nme introduce myself.\cI am a globe-trotting elite of the\nInternational Police.\cMy name... Ah, no, I shall inform you\nonly of my code name.\cMy code name, it is Looker.\nIt is what they all call me.\cIncidentally, is the saying, “Don't be\na thief!” familiar to you?
Looker: Yes, that is correct.\nTaking what belongs to others is wrong.\c
Looker: No? You claim to not know it?\nHow could that be?\cPerhaps your mama has said it, but you\nhave forgotten it, like usual?\cNow listen, my friends. It is wrong to\ntake what belongs to others.\c
Unfortunately, there are apparently\nthose who do not heed those words.\cIn Sinnoh, in fact, there are criminals\nstealing the Pokémon of others.\cI have, therefore, been on the lookout\nfor characters arousing my suspicion.\cIncidentally, you are Trainers, yes?\nPerhaps you can make use of this?\c
That Vs. Recorder, it is a nifty device\nfor recording a match.\cI obtained it because it is quite popular\nthese days.\cBut myself, I do not do Pokémon\nbattling very often.\cIt will be in better hands with you.\c
Looker: Also, I have a request.\cIf you were to see me again, I ask that\nyou not talk to me, for I am on duty.\c...Actually, yes, yes, you may speak to\nme. You must.\cNot because I am lonely, no, no!\nYou must inform me of bad guys!\rYou must inform me of any happenings!\c
Dawn: ...Working for the International\nPolice must be hard.\c
[VAR 0103(0000,0000)], here it is.\nIt's the Trainers' School.\rThe name says it all!\c
I saw your friend [VAR 0103(0001,0000)] go in\nearlier.\cHe could still be in there studying.\nOK, bye now!\c
Lucas: ...Working for the International\nPolice sounds hard.\c
[VAR 0103(0000,0000)], here we are.\nThis is the Trainers' School.\rThe name says it all!\c
Your pal [VAR 0103(0001,0000)] went in earlier.\nHe might still be studying in there.\cOK, see you around!\c
Jubilife City's built on land they\ncarved out of a mountain.\cThe people and Pokémon of Oreburgh\nCity helped out with that undertaking.
Hello! Let me ask you, have you paid\na visit to the TV station?\cIf you've never been, you owe it to\nyourself to make the trip.\cAnd, if you've been there before,\nit never hurts to visit again.\cAfter all, you can be a star!\nOr at least dream of being one!
Ah, it is you! Have no fear.\nThere are no shady characters about.\cIncidentally, have you visited the\nTrainers' School?\cDid your friend not guide you there\nearlier?
Looker: Hello, my friend.\nHave you visited the Trainers' School?\cDid your friend not guide you there\nearlier?\c
Ah, it is you! Have no fear.\nThere are no shady characters about.\cIncidentally, have you not obtained\na Pokétch?\cI believe a Pokétch is now free in\nexchange for some Coupons?
Looker: Tell me, have you not obtained\na Pokétch?\cI believe a Pokétch is now free in\nexchange for some Coupons?\c
Ah, it is you! Have no fear.\nThere are no shady characters about.\cIncidentally, have you not obtained\na Gym Badge?\cI believe you receive one for defeating\nthe Gym Leader at a Pokémon Gym?
Looker: Tell me, have you not obtained\na Pal Pad?\cIs not a Pal Pad free to anyone visiting\nthe Pokémon Center's basement?\c
Ah, yes. I see that you have obtained\nit, a Pal Pad for yourself.\cI myself, a member of the International\nPolice, the fighters of crime around the\rworld, have one also.\cFor it is what one must have to trade\nPokémon with Trainers around the world.\cTake that Pal Pad to the Global Terminal\nfor trading on an international level!\c
Anyway, there appears to be no one\nshady in this Jubilife City.\cI shall therefore take my investigation\nelsewhere.\cBut, my friend, I suggest you remain\nvigilant for shady grown-ups!\c
Oh, oh, oh?\cYou call yourself a Pokémon Trainer?\nAnd yet you have no Pokétch?\cThat is, Pokémon Watch, or Pokétch\nfor short!\cOh my, you are a rare case\nindeed!\c
You see, I invented, and now\nmanufacture, Pokétches.\cNot only that, I'm now conducting\nthe Pokétch promotional campaign!\cAll you have to do is find three\nclowns in Jubilife City.\cIf you can find them...\nI will gift you with a Pokétch!
The three clowns will each ask you\na skill-testing question.\cThe questions will all have to do\nwith Pokémon.\cAfter all, a Pokétch is a tool for\nPokémon Trainers.\cCollect a Coupon from each clown,\nthen come see me, OK?
OK, let me count your Coupons!\nI'll use the Pokétch here...\cOne, two, three!\nBravo! I say, bravo!\cIn return for these Coupons,\nI present you this Pokémon Watch,\ror Pokétch for short!\c

Hi! I'm a Pokétch campaign clown!\nLet's roll out my question!\cDoes a Pokémon grow by defeating\nothers and gaining Exp. Points?
Ding-ding!\nYou're absolutely correct!\c
Bzzzzt!\nThat's the wrong answer...
Pokémon grow stronger by defeating\nother Pokémon in battle.\cSome Pokémon even grow into an\nentirely different form in a process\rknown as evolution.\c

Hi! I'm a Pokétch campaign clown!\nLet's roll out my question!\cJust like Pokémon types, the moves\nof Pokémon also have types?
Ding-ding!\nYou're absolutely correct!\c
Bzzzzt!\nThat's the wrong answer...
If the Pokémon's type matches its\nmove's type, that move is made much\rmore powerful!\c

Hi! I'm a Pokétch campaign clown!\nLet's roll out my question!\cCan a Pokémon hold an item?
Ding-ding!\nYou're absolutely correct!\c
Bzzzzt!\nThat's the wrong answer...
A Pokémon may hold a single item.\cSome items become effective as soon\nas they are held by a Pokémon.\cBerries are eaten by Pokémon as\nnecessary during battle.\c

Hi, there. You should stick around.\nWe're doing a Pokétch campaign soon.\cBefore it starts, I think you should\nbrush up at the Trainers' School.

Mystery man: Now, now, now, now, now!\nProfessor Rowan, you must comply.\cHand over all your research findings.\nFor free, naturally.\cFailure to comply will result in a painful\ntime for your assistant.\c
Rowan: Ah, [VAR 0103(0000,0000)].\nWell? How is the Pokédex progressing?\cHm!\nThat's Oreburgh's Gym Badge, I see.\cBut hadn't I given you your first\nPokémon only recently...?\cPerhaps being a Trainer is like second\nnature to you.\c
Mystery man: Oh, professor of Pokémon,\nmust you be so difficult?\cWe are speaking to you on business.\nBecause this is work for us.\cWhat we're saying is--we demand\nyou comply with our demands.\c
Rowan: Quiet, you lot!\nWhy must you be such a nuisance?\cLet me list some lessons you still\nneed to learn.\c#1: Don't loiter about for no good\nreason.\c#2: Don't interrupt others while they\nare attempting to converse.\c#3: If you don't get your way, don't\nraise your voice to be intimidating.\c#4: Don't think you've grown strong\njust because you're in a group.\c#5: What is with those outlandish\noutfits you have on?\c
My goodness...\nYou call yourselves adults?\cYou kids, don't grow up to be like these\nsorry specimens.\c
Mystery man: Eeeeeh!\nYou had to make this personal!\cYou have forced our hand into making\na show of force!\cWe will make you regret insulting\nTeam Galactic!\c
Rowan: You kids, give these thugs a\nlesson in civility, please.\c
Dawn: [VAR 0103(0001,0000)]!\nLet's battle together!\c
Lucas: [VAR 0103(0001,0000)]!\nJoin me and battle these guys!\c
Grunt 1: You leave us no option.\nWe will retreat for now.\cWe shall do so because Team Galactic\nis benevolent to all.\c
Rowan: That lot...\nThey called themselves Team Galactic.\cWhen Pokémon evolve, they seem to\nrelease some type of energy...\cHowever, I believe that it's a mystic\npower far beyond our control.\cBut Team Galactic seems to be studying\nthat power's potential.\cThey want to know if it can be used as\nenergy for something...\c
Dawn: [VAR 0103(0001,0000)], did you know?\cThe professor studies the evolution\nof Pokémon, too.\cAccording to his research, 90% of all\nPokémon are somehow tied to evolution!\cWell, maybe that's the reason those\npeople tried to take the professor's\rresearch data by force.\cThat's really unforgivable!\c
Lucas: [VAR 0103(0001,0000)], did you know\nabout this?\cThe professor studies the\nevolution of Pokémon, too.\cAccording to his research, 90% of all\nPokémon are somehow tied to evolution!\cMaybe that's the reason those goons\ntried to take the professor's\rresearch data.\rThey're not allowed to do that!\c
Rowan: It's all over, so you can \nrelax now.\cStill, thanks to you two, nothing came\nof that situation. I appreciate that.\cIncidentally, [VAR 0103(0000,0000)].\nKudos to you for your battling skill.\cIt got me thinking. Why don't you\ncollect all the Gym Badges of Sinnoh?\cDoing so, you will be sure to encounter\nlots of Pokémon.\cThat, of course, means your Pokédex\npages will continuously fill up.\cIn other words, it will be of great help\nto my research.\cThat said, I've given you your first\nPokémon and Pokédex as yours to keep.\cYou're free to do with them as you wish.\nTake care now.\c
Oh, that was very good!\nNicely done! Truly excellent!\cOh, I beg your pardon, I'm from\nJubilife TV!\cI'd like you to have something for\nletting me see that smashing battle!\c
Contained within that Fashion Case...\cYou will find a whole spectrum of chic\nAccessories and tasteful Backdrops!\cDress up your Pokémon and watch\ntheir appeal grow!\cAnd, right now the TV station is\noffering its facilities so visitors\rcan dress up their Pokémon!\cThere are also prize giveaways, too!\nPlease do visit our TV station!\c
The way you look...\nYou're obviously a Trainer!\cCan you tell me what type of Pokémon\nyou like?
The Fire type?\nYou must have a fiery personality.\cYou'd better watch out that fire isn't\ndoused by water, though.
A person that likes the Water type\nmust be somewhat cool.\cBut beware of being drained dry by\nthirsty grass.
You chose the Grass type?\nNo wonder you look so calm.\cI think you need to watch out you don't\nget burned by fire.
Did you see me on TV?\nI was in an interview!
When you walk with your Pokémon,\nthey gradually grow friendlier.
OK, set six Poké Balls in my\nbelt...\cYeah, that'll do it. At most, you\ncan have six Pokémon with you.
Hiya, where'd you come from?\c...\cTwinleaf Town, huh...\nIt's a nice place. Quiet and all.\cJubilife City is a big place, so it\nmight be a bit of a shock to you.
Hello, Trainer!\nDo you know much about Pokémon?
Ah, I see!\nYou are knowledgeable!\cI imagine you wouldn't see the need\nto visit the Trainers' School, then.\cBut do visit if you have the time.\nYou may discover something new!
Oh, you're not knowledgeable...\nBut not to worry!\rThere's the Trainers' School.\cThe school will teach you the\nbasics of Pokémon.
Past here is the Global Terminal, your\ngateway to the world!\cOh, I'm sorry, you don't have\nany Gym Badges.\cThe Global Terminal is off-limits if you\ndon't have a Gym Badge. Sorry!\c
Past here is the Global Terminal.\nIt lets you trade with the whole world!\cTrading Pokémon means connecting\nwith friends, both old and new.\cThat's awesome!

Aww, man.\nI wasted money on some Poké Balls.\cI should've lowered the HP of wild\nPokémon more before throwing them.
The one thing you must remember is to\npack some Potions.\cIf all your Pokémon faint, it'll be\nlights out for you, too!
Potions are important, but sometimes,\nit's better to simply avoid battles.\cIf you want to avoid wild Pokémon for a\nwhile, just use a Repel.\cAfter all, if you don't battle, your\nPokémon can't lose HP.

[VAR 0103(0001,0000)]: Hey, [VAR 0103(0000,0000)]!\nDid you come to study, too?\cI went ahead and memorized everything\nthat was up on the blackboard.\cAfter all, it's the Trainer's job to\navoid having their precious Pokémon\rhurt in battle, right?\cSo, [VAR 0103(0000,0000)], what brings you?\nHuh?\rYou've got something for me?\c
[VAR 0103(0000,0000)] delivered the Parcel.
[VAR 0103(0001,0000)]: So, what is this...?\cScore!\nIt's a Town Map!\cHuh?!\nWhy are there two in here?\cI like it a lot, but I don't need two.\nHere, [VAR 0103(0000,0000)], you take one!\c
[VAR 0103(0001,0000)]: Hmm...\cWell, according to the Town Map,\nI guess Oreburgh City is where\rI should be going next.\cThere's a Gym, so it'd be perfect for\nraising the Pokémon I just caught.\cWell, I'm on the road to becoming\nthe greatest Trainer of all time!\cSee you around!\c
It's perfectly fine for Trainers and\nPokémon to develop at their own pace.\cIf there is anything you're not familiar\nwith, you can look it up here.
                             
We learned about Pokémon types\ntoday. Umm...\cGrass is weak to Fire,\cFire is weak to Water,\cand Water is weak to Grass!
Pokémon are smart enough to use\nitems they're holding.\cBut they won't know what to do with\nman-made items like Potions and\rAntidotes.
I wrote an essay in my notebook on \nwhat makes a true Pokémon Trainer.
Doing it is the best way to learn!\nCan we get a battle with you?
Go!\nMy Pokémon, go!\c
Aww! But battling is the best way\nto learn about Pokémon!
It's hard to win if you don't have\nsome Pokémon to choose from.
Whew! You're really good!\cWe've been studying every day, but\nwe were no match for you at all!\cYou'd be able to use this Potion\nproperly. Here you go!\c
When a Potion is used, it restores the\nHP, the health, of a Pokémon.\cBeing a good Trainer isn't only about\nordering your Pokémon around.\cA superior Trainer knows how to use\nitems to the full advantage!
I just became friends with my\nPokémon.\cI'm not sure if we can do this\nproperly, but may we battle?
I need to try the things I learned\nbefore I forget them!\c
Boo!\nWhere's your sense of adventure?\cDon't be shy about talking to people\nand getting into battles!
I wonder if we could have done better\nagainst you?\cLike if I used Potions right when we\nneeded to.
We were actually confident that we\nwould do pretty good.\cBut I'm completely impressed by how\ntough you are.\cIf you'd like, talk to my friend and\nget a nice item from him.
The blackboard lists status changes\nthat may affect Pokémon in battle.\c
Which would you like to read about?
If a Pokémon is poisoned, it will\nsteadily lose HP.\cThe effects of poison remain after\na battle.\cA poisoned Pokémon's HP will drop\nwhile it is traveling.\cHeal a poisoning using an Antidote.\c
If a Pokémon becomes paralyzed,\nits Speed stat drops.\cIn addition, it may not be able to\nmove while it is in battle.\cParalysis remains after battle.\nCure it using a Parlyz Heal.\c
If a Pokémon falls asleep, it will be\nunable to attack.\cThe Pokémon may wake up on its own,\nbut if a battle ends while it is\rsleeping, it will stay asleep.\cWake it up using an Awakening.\c
A burn reduces the Attack stat and\nsteadily reduces the victim's HP.\cA burn lingers after battle.\nCure a burn using a Burn Heal.\c
If a Pokémon is frozen, it becomes\ncompletely helpless.\cThe Pokémon may thaw out on its own,\nbut if a battle ends while it is\rfrozen, it will stay frozen.\cThaw it out using an Ice Heal.\c
It's a notebook filled with writing.\nLet's see...\cPokémon are to be caught using\nPoké Balls.\cUp to six Pokémon can accompany\na Trainer.\cA Trainer is someone who catches\nPokémon, raises them, and battles\rwith them.\cA Trainer's mission is to defeat the\nstrong Trainers who await challengers\rin Pokémon Gyms.

Hey, hey! Old dude and kids!\nDid you hear?!\cThey're saying there was a huge\nexplosion at Lake Valor!\cBut, I hear everything's fine now.\nI guess it was just a lot of noise.\c
[VAR 0103(0000,0000)]: Gramps!\cI'm going!\nI have a bad feeling about this!\c
Rowan: ...That [VAR 0103(0000,0000)]...\nCan't sit still...\c[VAR 0103(0001,0000)], I don't like to demand,\nbut I need you at Lake Valor.\cIt's impossible for things to be OK.\nNot after an explosion like that.\cBut I have no idea what is taking\nplace...\cBut before you go, let me stress:\ndon't get in over your head.\cWe will try to join you as soon as\nwe inspect Lake Verity.\c
Dawn: ...[VAR 0103(0000,0000)], you'll be OK,\nno matter what, right?
Lucas: Lake Valor...\nI wonder what happened?
Dawn: We're going off to Lake Verity\nfirst...\cDon't do anything rash if something\ndoes happen.
Lucas: We're going to investigate\nLake Verity before we join you.\cDon't try to be a hero if anything\ncrazy happens.
Rowan: Hmm...\cWhat is taking place at Lake\nValor... You must find out!\cBut before you go, let me stress:\ndon't get in over your head.\cWe will try to join you as soon as\nwe inspect Lake Verity.
What's up?\nYour clothes look damp.\cMaybe you took the boat to Iron Island\nto get a Hidden Machine, right?
The tremor earlier was no quake.\nIt seems it was a mysterious explosion!
Welcome to Canalave City, the Canal\nCity!\cIn the old days, this port used to\nbe a hub of cargo transportation.
What was that tremor?\nI thought Mt. Coronet erupted!
There's a really impatient-looking boy\nhanging out in front of the library.\cHe's so jittery, just seeing him makes\nme feel twitchy.
I'm going to study at the library.\cI've taken an interest in the subject\nof time and space.
An explosion at Lake Valor?\nBut there isn't anything there?
My PSYDUCK is very close to me.\nThat makes its Return move powerful!

PSYDUCK: Gua?
PSYDUCK: Gua! Gua! Gwa?\nGuaa! Guuagwa?!

You were strong enough to take down\nmy prized team of Pokémon.\cIn recognition of that power,\nI give you this: the Mine Badge!\c
[VAR 0103(0000,0000)] received\nthe Mine Badge from Byron!

The ceiling-high bookshelves are\ncrammed with books.

Lucian: ...Ah, hello.\nYou're here to read, too?\cBooks are wonderful things.\cThe thoughts of people written in books\nstretch beyond time and space.\c
I imagine we'll see each other again\nat the Pokémon League. Take care.\c
I was just reading a collection of\nletters written by an artist long ago.\cMore precisely, they were written to\nthe artist's younger brother.\c“The stars above tantalize from\nacross infinite space.\c“Feeling their gaze from so far away,\nI am charmed again by life.”\cThe artist must have come to a\nconclusion seeing the night sky...\cIt's an affirmation of life.\nIt's very moving.\c
I was just reading an analytical tome on\nhumankind.\cIt examines the human species from\ncultural and social perspectives.\cThis is a thought-provoking quote: \n“It all began without humans.\rThe end will also be without humans.”\cThe world we share with Pokémon...\nDoes it exist for us?\c
I was just reading a collection of\nobservations on Pokémon in the wild.\cOne article addresses the question why\nPokémon would go into a Poké Ball.\cAccording to the article, this behavior\nis based on instinct.\cA weakened Pokémon will curl up tight\nin an effort to heal itself.\cThe Poké Ball was invented to take\nadvantage of that protective instinct.\c
I was just reading a collection of\nessays on the science-fiction genre.\cThere was one quote attributed to a\nnovelist I found remarkable.\c“Though love may lose, kindness wins.”\cI find that philosophical and, at the\nsame time, compassionate.\c
I was just reading a book of philosophy\nfrom an ancient, far-off land.\cTheir “universe” was a word that\ndescribed both space and time.\cThat people even back then understood\nthe basic tenets of the universe...\cIt fills me with a serene sense of\ninspiration.\c

Well, hello!\nWe meet again!\cAfter we parted, I went from Oreburgh\nto Hearthome, Celestic, then Eterna.\cYes, the town and cities surrounding\nthe foot of Mt. Coronet.\cWhy my fascination with Mt. Coronet,\nyou may ask?\cWell, Mt. Coronet happens to be called\n“The origin of Sinnoh.”\cI learned many things on my journey.\nWould you like to hear about them?
Whoa, now let's not be hasty!\nI really want to share this with you!
The way I see it, our world began when\nthe spirit within people was born.\cWhen that spirit came to be, there\nfollowed awareness about the world.\cWithin that newborn spirit, time and\nspace were intertwined as one.\cPeople and Pokémon, too, were but the\nsame presence.\cAs I understand it, people and Pokémon\nshared the spirit and awareness.\cThey should have understood and\naccepted each other then.\c
Because they shared the same spirit,\npeople and Pokémon intermingled.\cPeople took the place of Pokémon,\nand the opposite also held true.\cThat interpretation could give us an\nidea about how our world came to be.\cA Pokémon is said to have shaped\nthis world...\cCould that Pokémon be the physical form\nof the original spirit?\cHmm... The spirit came to be, and from\nit, time and space were born...\cThat seems to point to legendary\nDIALGA, the Pokémon of time, and\rPALKIA, the Pokémon of space...\cAnd they lead back to ARCEUS, the\nPokémon that made them arise.\cIsn't this interesting?\nWould you like to hear some more?
Whoa, please don't tease me!\nI really want to share this with you!
Oh, there were also Plates, weren't\nthere?\cOne Plate read, “Three beings were\nborn to bind time and space.”\cThose three beings I read to mean\nthe three Pokémon of the lakes.\rIt's about UXIE, MESPRIT, and AZELF.\cThe myth describes how they gave\nspirit to the world, shaping it.\cBut it all starts with ARCEUS, the\nfirst. It is known as the Original One.\c
Oh, by the way, I wrote down the words\nengraved on those Plates.\cI summarized them in a book and\ndonated it to this library.\cThere it is in that bookshelf.\nI'd be pleased if you'd read it.\c
I have to say I'm glad I came out to\nSinnoh.\cI suppose I'd better be off in search\nof new myths in faraway lands.\cIt would be nice if our paths were to\ncross again.\c
”Sinnoh's Beginning as Told on Plates.”\cThis is a collection of engravings from\nancient Plates found in Sinnoh.\c“The Original One breathed alone before\nthe universe came.”\c“When the universe was created,\nits shards became this Plate.”\c“The power of defeated giants\ninfuses this Plate.”\c“Two beings of time and space set\nfree from the Original One.”\c“Three beings were born to bind\ntime and space.”\c“Two make matter, and three make\nspirit, shaping the world.”\c“The powers of Plates are shared\namong Pokémon.”\c“The rightful bearer of a Plate\ndraws from the Plate it holds.”\c[VAR 0103(0000,0000)] returned the book to its\nplace.

[VAR 0103(0000,0000)]: OK, gramps!\nI brought [VAR 0103(0001,0000)] like I said!\cAll right, I'll be outta here!\c
Rowan: ...\n...\c...\n...\c...\n...\c
[VAR 0103(0000,0000)]: ...OK...\nI get it...\c
Rowan: Hm! Everyone's here finally.\n[VAR 0103(0000,0000)], everyone, listen.\cYou may have forgotten already, but\nI study the evolution of Pokémon.\c
But the more I study, the more\nmysteries appear and multiply.\cPokémon that evolve, and those that\ndon't...\cWhat makes them different from each\nother?\cDo those that are immature as living\nbeings evolve to ones more mature?\cIf so, what do we make of the\nlegendary Pokémon that don't evolve?\cAre we to assume that the legendary\nPokémon are complete as creatures?\c
This is where you three come in.\cIn the three lakes of Sinnoh, there\nare said to be mirage Pokémon.\cIf we can obtain data on them,\nit may shed some light on how the\rprocess of Pokémon evolution works.\cI need help from each one of you\non this grand undertaking.\cHelp me find these Pokémon that are\nconsidered to be mirages.\c
[VAR 0103(0000,0000)]: What are you saying?\nI didn't get a Pokédex!\c

Rowan: Lucas, you go to Lake Verity.\c
Lucas: Yes, sir!\c
Rowan: [VAR 0103(0000,0000)], I want you to\ninvestigate Lake Acuity.\cThat would take you almost to\nSnowpoint City.\cThe road there is harsh. I need\na tough Trainer to go.\c

Announcer: What you've just witnessed\nis actual footage from the scene.\cIt was taken by a cameraman who\nhappened to be there.\cNewscaster: It's certainly impressive.\cWho knows what the explosion could\nexpose at the lake?\c
[VAR 0103(0000,0000)]: Gramps!\nThey said it was an explosion?!\c
Rowan: Hmm...\nBut why at Lake Valor...?\cLet's get outside.\nI'm concerned about the town.\cYou kids, be careful going down the\nstairs.\c
Rowan: [VAR 0103(0001,0000)].\nYou should leave now, too.\c...There may be aftershocks, however.\nBe alert always.\c

Welcome!\nThis is the Oreburgh Pokémon Gym!\cI'm Roark, the Gym Leader!\cI'm but one Trainer who decided to\nwalk proudly with Rock-type Pokémon!\cAs the Gym Leader, I need to see\nyour potential as a Trainer.\cAnd, I'll need to see the toughness\nof the Pokémon that battle with you!\c
This is embarrassing...\cI went and lost to a Trainer who\ndidn't have a single Gym Badge...\cBut that's tough. You were strong,\nand I was weak. That's all there is.\cAccording to Pokémon League rules,\nI have to give you our Gym Badge\rsince you've beaten me, the Leader.\cHere's your official Pokémon League\nCoal Badge.\c
[VAR 0103(0000,0000)] received\nthe Coal Badge from Roark!
Having that Coal Badge means your\nPokémon can now use the hidden move\rRock Smash outside of battle.\cYou should also take this, too.\c
That [VAR 0108(0000,0000)] contains\nthe move Stealth Rock.\cIt's a move that inflicts damage on\nfoes that switch into battle.\cIncidentally, a TM will teach its move\nto a Pokémon instantly.\cBut a TM will break when you use it,\nso make certain you want a Pokémon\rto learn that move.
In this region of Sinnoh, there are\nseven other Gym Leaders.\cI should warn you--they're a lot\ntougher than I am!
Howdy!\nHow's it going, Champ-to-be?\cThat's what I said to a really\nimpatient boy earlier, too.\cThe Gym Leader is a user of\nRock-type Pokémon.\cWell, listen. Rock-type Pokémon\nreally hate water, all right?\cThey're also weak to Grass-type\nmoves.\cGee, they sure have weaknesses!\cBut don't think it will be easy.\cYou don't get to be a Gym Leader\nwithout covering for weaknesses.\cGoing after a Rock-type Pokémon\nwith a Fire-type Pokémon won't be\reasy, either.\cThat's all the advice I can give.\nThanks for listening!
Oh! [VAR 0103(0000,0000)]!\nYou've taken care of the Gym Leader!\cSo, did my advice come in handy\nor what?\cIf my advice was useful, it'd be\ngreat if you'd become my fan!

Hello! Welcome to the Oreburgh\nMining Museum!
Hello, hello!\nHow are you?\cI study Pokémon Fossils!\nMe! Right here and now!\c
You have a Fossil for me, yes?\nShall I turn it into a Pokémon?
Which Fossil should I turn back\ninto a Pokémon? Choose! Now!
OK, I will do that! Turn that Fossil\nback into a Pokémon, surely I will!
You don't wish that I extract any\nPokémon from a Fossil. Fine, then!
I am in the process of extracting\nyour Pokémon from a Fossil.\cYou go outside, yes, please. Now!\nTime alone is what I now need. NOW!!!
You were gone too long!\nYou kept us waiting! Unacceptable!\cThis is your [VAR 0100(0000,0000)]!\nYou be good to it, OK!\c
[VAR 0103(0000,0000)] received\nthe [VAR 0100(0001,0000)]!\c
Give a nickname to the [VAR 0100(0001,0000)]\nyou received?
But, no, I cannot do this!\nYou have too many Pokémon with you!\cI must hold it for you, so come back,\nyou, and take it away, please.
If it is a Fossil that you obtain,\nbring it to me if you must.
On the verge of a breakthrough, I am,\nto achieve extraction from Fossils.\cFrom Fossils I can extract Pokémon,\nbut not yet, not yet.
Whoa! So this is coal?\nI never expected something this big!\cAnd that color!\nIt really is as black as they say!
Wow! The Pokémon that carried this\nmust be terribly strong!
Well, how about that!\cThe Oreburgh Mine extends under\nthe seafloor!
It's a little far from here, but there\nis a city called Eterna City.\cI've heard a curious person named the\nUnderground Man lives there.\cWith a name like that, he must be an\nauthority on the Underground.
Mining must take a strong mind, not\njust a tough body.\cThink about it. You're in darkness,\ndigging desperately through rock.
The history of Oreburgh Mine...\cYou could call it a history of effort and\nfriendship between people and Pokémon.
How Coal Is Made   1\c“In a time long before history,\nvegetative matter was swept along\cby rain and rivers. It came to be\nburied under the ground.”
How Coal Is Made   2\c“The buried plant matter was\nforced ever deeper under the ground\cdue to tremors and fissures caused\nby the shifting landmasses.”
How Coal Is Made   3\c“Deep under the ground, the\nplant matter was subjected to heavy\cpressure and the heat of magma.\nIt gradually turned into coal.”
Samples of coal from different regions\nare displayed.
The box contains categorized samples\nof coal.
Different kinds of lamps are\ndisplayed.\cThey appear to have been worn\non someone's head while underground.
Badly scarred wooden tools are\ndisplayed.\cThey apparently dug out coal using\nthese tools in the olden days.
The everyday items and tools of\npast mine workers are displayed.

Have you ever seen or heard about\ndifferently colored Pokémon?\cFor instance, a regular PIKACHU has\na yellow body, correct?\cWell, the different-colored PIKACHU\nhas a sort of orange body.
You know how Pokémon have different\nnatures like we have personalities?\cI don't think it's surprising to see\nPokémon in different colors.
PIKACHU: Pikaaah!

Hiya! Your Pokémon could use some\ntoughening up.\cWhy not try training in\nthe Oreburgh Mine?
I always have a rotten time trying\nto decide which moves my Pokémon\rshould learn.
You remind me so much of the time\nI got my first Pokémon.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Text File : 82

The Oreburgh Mine is operated\nwith the utmost care.\cWe avoid causing any damage to\nthe natural habitats of Pokémon.
Wow... Your Pokémon's eyes are\ntwinkling brightly!\cSeeing that makes me happy!\nHere, I want you to have this!\c
You know how Pokémon stay inside\ntheir Poké Balls?\cI try to think about what would be\nthe best Poké Balls for them.
Coal is carried out of Oreburgh Mine on\na fully automated system.\cMachines do all the work automatically.\nSo, it's all very easy.

Cyrus: ...So, this is Eterna's Pokémon\nstatue...\cShaping our world are time and space\nin an intertwining spiral.\cRevered in Sinnoh are the Pokémon of\ntime and space...\cSinnoh's myth...\nIts truth needs investigation...\c
...Pardon me.\nStand aside.\c
[VAR 0103(0000,0000)]: Oh, hey!\cWhen we smacked together, a brilliant\nflash of inspiration came to me!\cAn easy way to become a great Trainer!\nYeah, that!\cAll right.\nListen close...\cMake certain all your attacks hit!\nAvoid enemy attacks for sure!\cYou do that, you'd never lose!\nYou'd be the invincible Trainer!\cAnyway, go check out the Pokémon\nstatue. See you around!\c
Oh, that device you have...\cIt is a Pokédex?\nWow, it brings back some memories.\cPardon me, but what's your name?\c...\cOK, hello, [VAR 0103(0000,0000)].\nI'll be sure to remember that name!\cMy name is Cynthia.\nI'm a Trainer just like you.\cI've been studying Pokémon mythology\nlately, just out of curiosity.\c
Here in Eterna City, there is a statue\nof an ancient Pokémon.\cHave you seen it already?\cAccording to myth, it was an extremely\npowerful Pokémon.\cWho knows? You may encounter something\nlike it while you're traveling with your\rPokédex.\cOh, I know! Try using this.\nIt should be helpful.\c
Cynthia: Remember, the hidden move\nCut can be used in the field.\cIt will let you go places that were\npreviously inaccessible to you.\cThat's important for filling up your\nPokédex, right?\cThen luck be with you, young Trainer!\cOh, there's one last thing!\nPlease give my regards to Prof. Rowan.\c
Cynthia: Oh, there you are!\cI was looking for you.\nI've got something nice.\cI wanted you to have this Pokémon Egg.\nWill you accept it?
Cynthia: That's wonderful!\cThe Pokémon inside the Egg is\nhappy, too. I'm sure of it!\c
Cynthia: Oh?\nYou have six Pokémon with you already.\rYou don't have room for this Egg.\cYou'll have to store a Pokémon in a\nPC Box at the Pokémon Center first.\cI'll give you this Egg when you've made\nroom for it.\cI'll be waiting right here.
Cynthia: Oh...?\nYou don't need to feel obligated.\cIt's hard filling the pages of the\nPokédex, isn't it?\cI only want to lend you a little hand,\nthat's all.
Cynthia: Oh, wait!\cDon't leave without this Pokémon Egg.\nPlease? I want you to have it.\c
Cynthia: Well?\nWill you accept this Pokémon Egg?
                               
Cynthia: Keep that Egg with you in your\nparty of Pokémon.\cA Pokémon will hatch from it while you\nare traveling.\cI would be happy to know that it will\nhelp fill another page of your Pokédex.\cSee you again!\c
Hi! I'm Gardenia!\nI'm this town's Gym Leader!\cMy last challenger was this awfully\nspeedy young guy.\c...Actually, his name was [VAR 0103(0000,0000)].\nHe told me about you.\cHe said that another challenger's on\nthe way, so that made me antsy!\cAt my Gym, no one gets to battle with\nthe Gym Leader, me, until the end.\cThe challenger has to beat all the\nother Gym Trainers first.\cI'll be waiting for you in the back,\nTrainer. Don't disappoint me!\c
Hey! You there, kid!\nStay away from that Pokémon statue!\cTeam Galactic is conducting an\nofficial investigation here!
Hey, you! Yeah, you, Trainer!\cErrr...\nIt's OK. Never mind. You look tough.\cI won't take... Um, I'll just let you\nkeep your Pokémon. Carry on!
Have you seen our building?\cTeam Galactic is so stinking rich\nthat we can have one built instantly!
Since that Team Galactic building went\nup, the city's atmosphere has gotten\rall creepy and tense.\cI don't know what those people are\ndoing up in that place...
With Team Galactic gone, what's going\nto happen to their building?
My friend said Team Galactic took his\nfavorite Pokémon away.\cI don't think he's telling the truth.\nTeam Galactic looks so cool.\rThey don't look like common thugs.
Do you use your Bike's kickstand?\cIt looks cool to hop off your Bike and\nthen snap it into place in one motion!
If you're visiting Eterna, you need to\nget yourself a Bicycle and take a\rride down the Cycling Road.
Oh, your Pokémon are rather fetching.\cWhy, they look ready for Contests in\nHearthome City!
They say this is an old city.\cIt doesn't look it, though.\nNot with all these tall buildings.
Eterna City's not anything like it\nwas before, way back in the day.
They say this is an awesome Pokémon\nthat people saw long ago.
Oh, don't tell me you don't have\nan Explorer Kit?\cYou should have a word with the man\nnext door to the Pokémon Center.\c
Oh, don't tell me you don't have\nan Explorer Kit?\cYou should have a word with the man\nnext door to the Pokémon Center.

Yup! If there's one thing I can tell\nabout you, it's this!\cYou and your Pokémon are gonna get\neven tougher, and I mean seriously!
Welcome!\nWithout further ado, let's go!\c
This gym's floral clock...\nYou can walk on its hands.\rThat's how you get to the next Trainer.
My Grass-type Pokémon can dole out\nsome serious special attacks...\cI won't let you win...easily!\c
Every time you beat a Trainer, the\nfloral clock moves.\cThe fountain also stops if I lose.\cIt's so you can go to the Pokémon\nCenter during your challenge.
You can't win when you're distracted by\nthe lovely aromas of Pokémon!\c
The floral clock moves, and time\nflows...\cThere's only our Gym Leader left.\nGo on, don't be afraid!
The fountain's water level dropped!\cIt's possible to walk across the\nfountain now!
Hey, there!\nHow's it going, Champ-to-be?\cActually, that's what I said to some\nboy who zipped in here earlier, too!\cThe Gym Leader, Gardenia, is a user\nof Grass-type Pokémon.\cIt should be obvious, but Grass-type\nPokémon really hate fire.\cThey're also at a huge disadvantage\nagainst the Flying type, too.\cOh, wait a second. I should tell you\nabout the Gym itself first.\cYou can't challenge the Gym Leader\nuntil you beat all the Gym's Trainers.\cIt's a bit challenging, but just think\nof it as good training and go for it!

Oh! Would you like to battle against the\nboth of us?
You're live on camera, but try to act\nnatural, OK?\c
OK, that's how it is, huh.\nCan't do anything about that.
Whee!\nWasn't that battle smoking hot?\cYou should make a Battle Video of it and\nshare it with the world!
Oh, dear!\nYou only have one Pokémon with you?\cThat's very commendable, but we can't\nbattle with you that way.

A Pokémon that slips into electric\nappliances, you say...\cHmm...\cThat is somewhat off from what I've\nheard about it.\cHmm...\nThis is what I've heard.\cLong ago, there was a Pokémon that\nmerged with a toy robot.\cShould that Pokémon be recognized as a\nnew species or not...\cDebates over the issue were about to\nstart when they were rendered moot.\cThe very topic of discussion--the\nPokémon-infused robot--disappeared...\c
Anyway, this ROTOM...\nWhat an interesting Pokémon.\cSo, you say it enters an appliance and\nessentially merges with the device.\cIn the process, it may also learn new\nmoves.\cIn a way, I suppose it could be thought\nof as a mechanical Pokémon.\cHmm...!\cThough it is utterly unique, it is\nundeniably a form of Pokémon.\cFine, fine, so be it!\cNo matter how old one gets, there will\nalways be new Pokémon discoveries!\cTake care, [VAR 0103(0000,0000)]!\c
It's an old notebook.\nThere's no telling how old it is.\cWould you like to read it?
“Our encounter was a sudden one.\c“It was when I found my toy robot,\none that I had earlier misplaced.\c“At that instant, a Pokémon startlingly\nemerged from the lawn mower's motor!\c“Clutching my robot, I stared,\ntransfixed by the peculiar Pokémon.”\c...Would you like to keep reading?
“The Pokémon hovered in the air, held\naloft by a power unseen.\c“As if curious and unafraid of my\npresence, it floated toward me.\c“Crackling sounds accompanied it, as \nif from static electricity in the air.\c“Remarkably, it seemed the Pokémon\nwas the source of this power!\c“In alarm, I flinched, certain that my\nface would be subjected to a shock.\c“Much to my surprise, the Pokémon\nseemed to favor me with a smile.”\c...Would you like to keep reading?
“Finally, I came to realize that the\nPokémon only wished to be friends.\c“I have decided to name this most\nwondrous Pokémon 'ROTOM.'\c“Simple though it may be, ROTOM emerged\nto me from the motor of a lawn mower.\c“Motor and ROTOM...\nSurely the link is obvious?”\c...Would you like to keep reading?
“ROTOM is a Pokémon that is simply\nsensational.\c“The fact that it can turn invisible is\nsimply the beginning.\c“What makes ROTOM unique is its ability\nto enter and operate machinery!”\c...This is about halfway through.\nWould you like to keep reading?
“ROTOM and I became fast friends.\nWe were perpetual companions.\c“The electricity from its body forbade\ncontact, however.\c“We could not touch, let alone hug or\nhold hands, but we cared not.\c“For we were bonded on a much deeper,\nincorporeal level.”\c...Would you like to keep reading?
“A feeling of mischief got the better\nof me one day.\c“Seeing ROTOM hovering, I decided to\nstartle it--normally I would not.\c“Perhaps frightened, ROTOM discharged\npower beyond its usual range.\c“I fell, stunned, into the arms of\nunconsciousness...”\c...Would you like to keep reading?
“When I came to, to my horror I\nrealized that ROTOM had disappeared.\c“I searched high and low for my friend\nin dismay and desperation.\c“'Don't chastise yourself.'\c“'The fault is mine. No harm done.'\c“'Let us play as we always have.'\c“Though my words poured out, my friend\ncould not be found to hear them...”\c...Would you like to keep reading?
“My search for ROTOM carried me far\nfrom home.\c“It was in the town's rubbish heap that\nI again found my old toy robot.\c“Curiously, our eyes met, then the\nrobot waved a hand as if in greeting.\c“I knew then that I had found my lost\nfriend.\c“I ran to it and hugged ROTOM tight,\ntalking on and on.”\c...Would you like to keep reading?
“The robot's eyes lit up happily as\nI held it.\c“I'm certain that, within it, ROTOM was \nemitting lots of electricity.\c“Somehow, I felt I could understand\nROTOM's thoughts better than before.\c“Also, I realized that we would remain\nfriends throughout our lives...”\c...The notebook ends with this page...

Hello, hello!\nI am the official Name Rater!\cWant me to rate the nicknames of\nyour Pokémon?
Which Pokémon's nickname should\nI critique?
[VAR 0101(0000,0000)], is it?\nThat's a decent nickname!\cBut would you like to give it\nan even better name?\cHow about it?
Ah, good. Then, what shall the new\nnickname be?
Done! From now on, this Pokémon\nshall be known as [VAR 0101(0000,0000)]!\cIt is a better name than before!\nHow fortunate for you!
I see.\nPlease come visit again.
Done! From now on, this Pokémon\nshall be known as [VAR 0101(0000,0000)]!\cIt looks no different from before,\nand yet, this is vastly superior!\cHow fortunate for you!
[VAR 0101(0000,0000)], is it?\nThat is a truly impeccable name!\cTake good care of [VAR 0101(0000,0000)]!
Now, now. That is merely an Egg!\nAn Egg can go by no other name!\n
Excuse me, but do you got that\nPokémon named BUIZEL?\cWanna trade it for my CHATOT?
Yes! So awesome! A BUIZEL!\nI so promise I'll be good to it!\cOh yeah, CHATOT can learn some human\nspeech pretty quickly.\cTry out its move Chatter.\nYou'll totally see what I mean.
What I totally want is a BUIZEL...
Oh, OK. Totally got it.\nIt's all right if you don't want to.\cBut if you change your mind,\nlet's totally trade some Pokémon.
Did that CHATOT I traded you totally\nlearn that Chatter move?\cIt will mimic your speech if you use\nthat move outside of battle.\cIt'll forget any speech you taught it\nif you stick it in a PC Box, though.
Hi! I'm the building superintendent.\nI maintain a vigilant 24-hour watch!

A Pokémon holding an Exp. Share will get\nsome of the Exp. Points from battle.\cIt will get Exp. Points even if it didn't\nactually battle.\cTherefore, it should be held by a\nPokémon you want to raise quickly.\cAlso, a Pokémon you get in a trade may\ndisobey you if it is too high in level.\cDon't worry, though. It will obey if\nyou have enough Gym Badges.
You've met only [VAR 0134(0001,0000)] Pokémon?\cHmm...\nYou've got to find at least 35.\cIf you can't, it will be tough to\ncomplete the Sinnoh Pokédex.

Oak: Ah, yes!\cAn acquaintance from Kanto has sent\nme something quite interesting.\cI think you'd make better use of it\nthan I ever could.\c
I understand there is a Pokémon that\nevolves when it is traded while holding\rthat Up-Grade.\c
Incidentally, and this is an entirely\ndifferent topic...\cI've heard that there have been\nsightings of very rare Pokémon.\cThe legendary bird Pokémon: ARTICUNO,\nZAPDOS, and MOLTRES!\cThey've been spotted at various\nlocations here in Sinnoh, no less!\cWhy, you may be lucky enough to see\nthem yourself in your journeys!
Oak: ARTICUNO, ZAPDOS, and MOLTRES\nare extremely rare even in Kanto.\cThere have been precious few sightings\nas it is.\cSo why would they be spotted here in\nSinnoh of all places?\cThere are still many, many mysteries\nsurrounding Pokémon, it seems!
Oak: Ah, it's you!\nHow goes it?\cWhat's that? You've caught ARTICUNO,\nZAPDOS, and MOLTRES?!\cNow that is incredible!\cWell, then, allow me to examine your\nPokédex.\c

Sheesh! \nWhat's the world coming to?!\cSomeone ripped off the descriptive\nplate from the Pokémon statue!\cNow no one can read the inscription!\nWhy would someone do that?\rActually, want to know what it said?
The first inscription went like this,\nsort of.\c“...creation of DIA...\n...giver of time...\c“In laughter, there is tears...\nAnd, likewise...\c“The same time flows...\n...the blessing of DIA...”\cYikes...\nI've forgotten big chunks of it.\cWant to hear about the other\ninscription?
The second inscription went sort of\nlike this.\c“...birth of PAL...\n...creator of parallel dimensions...\c“Alive, yet not alive...\n...rifts in space...\c“To arrive in the same univer...\n...the blessing of PAL...”\cI've heard some people talk about\nthere once being a third inscription.\cI'm kind of skeptical, though.\nI mean, think about it.\cA third Pokémon alongside those that\ncontrol time and space?\cThere couldn't possibly be a Pokémon\nthat mighty.

I am! I am the first to have gone\nunderground and dug some tunnels.\cYou can call me the Underground Man.\nEveryone else does.\cI'll make a gift of this to you.\nYou hold up your end of the deal\rand put it to good use!\c
My gift to you, the Explorer Kit,\nwill instantly take you underground!\cYou need only to use it, and you\nwill be down in the tunnels!\cThe Underground is a different world\nwhere you can do this, that,\rand the other thing, too!\cLet me mentor you into becoming\na full-fledged spelunker!\cWill you take on that challenge?
Let me mentor you as you become\na full-fledged spelunker!\cWill you take on that challenge?
I had hoped to teach a youngster\nlike you about the many charms of\rthe underground tunnels...\cBut I can't force you to accept my\nproposal if you're not inclined.\cSigh...\nI get so lonely sometimes...
Hm!\nWell said, my young friend!\cI will teach you by assigning missions.\nFirst, go underground!\cGoing underground is quite easy.\nSimply use your Explorer Kit.\cIf you accomplish that, I will give\nyou your next test.
You've not gone underground yet?\cTo get down to the underground\ntunnels, you need only to use your\rExplorer Kit.\cBut you need to be outside. It can't\nbe used indoors or in a cave.\cNow, off you go!
Hm! I see that you've gone down to\nthe underground tunnels!\cWell done!\nTake these as rewards!\c
Those are called Traps.\nThey're triggered when stepped on.\cThe Underground is a place where\nyou can go with your friends.\cYou might try setting those Traps\nwhen you're down there with others.\cNow, what should I assign you next...
How was it in the underground\ntunnels?\cBig and empty, I would think.\cBut that's only because you are\na novice spelunker!\cThere are many hidden things down there\nthat are not visible to the eye.\cFor my next test, I want you to dig\nup some Treasure or Spheres for me.\cWhile underground, check the Radar\nfor yellow spots.\cGo to such a location and search\nfor Treasure using the Touch Screen.
You've not located any Treasure \nor Spheres yet?\cListen. Check the Radar and go to\nany yellow spot that's shown.\cNext, use the Touch Screen to\nidentify places to dig.\cTry to get right on top of a yellow\nspot on the Radar, OK?\cOnce you are right in front of it,\npress the A Button!\cNow, off you go on your search!
Ah! You dug up what I was looking for!\nGood job on finding it!\cWell done, indeed!\nTake these as your reward!\c
Dig in the walls of the underground\ntunnels to unearth hidden stuff.\cFossils and Stones can be dug up and\nbrought out from down under.\cSpheres, which are gems, cannot be\nbrought out, but they can be\rexchanged for goods down there.\cNow, what should I assign you\nnext...?
My tests aren't over yet!\nNext, let's use some Spheres!\cThe Spheres one can find underground\nare very peculiar.\cWhen buried in the ground, they grow\ndaily, a little bit at a time.\cI want you to go bury these strange\nSpheres in the Underground.\cThat is my latest test!
You've not buried the Spheres yet?\nYou're afraid of losing them?\cHave no fear! Spheres are easily\nburied and just as easily dug up.\cDon't be afraid. Go bury those\nSpheres like I've said.\cJust don't forget where you've buried\nthem--the Underground is huge!
Good, good!\nYou've buried your Spheres!\cThe next time you go underground,\nthey should have grown bigger!\cJust don't forget where you've buried\nyour Spheres!\cAnyway, well done!\nThis is your reward!\c
You may have seen them already, but\nthere are Sphere collectors.\cThey wander about in the underground\ntunnels seeking Spheres.\cThey'll happily trade you items for\nbig Spheres.\cNow, what shall I assign you next...?
Have you grown weary of repeatedly\ngoing back to the Underground?\cWell, it's not over yet!\nNext up is your Secret Base!\cThat's right, I will teach you how to\nmake your own Secret Base!\cAll you need is the Digger Drill\nI gave you earlier.\cSimply go underground and use the\nDigger Drill wherever you like.\cThat will instantly make you your\nvery own Secret Base!\cSo, your next assignment is: go make\nyour own Secret Base!
Hm? You don't know how to use\nthe Digger Drill?\cOK, I'll admit this test may have\nbeen a little tricky for you.\cAll you need to do is find the\nDigger Drill among your Traps.\cThen, face a wall and use the Digger\nDrill. That's all it takes.\cDo that and you'll have your Secret\nBase before you can say...\c[VAR FF01(00C8)]Boo![VAR FF01(0064)]\cNo, seriously though!
Ah, you've made your Secret Base!\nExcellent!\cI thought I might have been asking\ntoo much of you, but you did it!\cWell done!\nTake these as your reward!\c
Incidentally, a Digger Drill can\nbe used only once.\cIf you wish to move your Secret\nBase, you will need to obtain another\rDigger Drill.\cYou can trade a Sphere for one\nunderground.\cWhat should I make you do next...
Hm! You've stuck it out to the end!\nThis is my final test.\cYou've made yourself a Secret Base,\nbut it's totally empty, is it not?\cNot to worry! You can decorate your\nown Secret Base as you see fit!\cSo! For my final test, I want you to\ndecorate your Secret Base.\cUse furniture and interior goods\nto give your Secret Base character!
Ah, have I finally managed to stump\nyou?\cPerhaps you've left your Secret\nBase's door open?\cYou see, the underground tunnels are\nvisited by many Trainers.\cIt wouldn't do to have someone\nbarge in on you while you're working\ron your Secret Base.\cDon't forget to close the door while\nyou're redecorating!
Ah! You've even managed to decorate\nyour Secret Base!\cI knew I recognized a spelunker\nin you!\cDon't forget to close the door when\nyou're decorating!\cWe don't want any visitors getting\nhurt by walking in on you!\cAlso, if you want to place goods\nyou've received, store them in the\rPC first.\cAnyway, well done!\nThis is your reward!\c
There are ways of collecting more\ndecoration goods.\cYou can grow Spheres you've found\nand trade them for goods.\cIt's also possible to obtain goods\nfrom friends.
I've taught you all I know, but if\nyou insist, there is one more thing\rI should tell you.\cThe Secret Base you've made has Big\nBoulders that get in the way, yes?\cThere is actually a way of moving\nthose boulders aside...\cHowever, the task may be dangerous\nfor you now.\cI suppose I could tell you how when\nyou get better as a spelunker...\c
...Hm! However, you are someone I'd\nrecognized as a born spelunker...\cFine! I will tell you, but only\nbecause you're exceptional!\cYou know that you may go underground\nwith your friends, correct?\cThat means your friends are certain\nto have Secret Bases of their own.\cNow, this is what you must do:\nFirst, find a friend's Secret Base.\cNext, go to the PC and steal your\nfriend's Flag.\cThen, run back to your Secret Base\nand take the Flag to your PC!\cIf you can do that, I will permit\nyou to move boulders.
Ah! My spelunker!\nAre you spelunking with your friends?\cIt's a hundred times more fun to play\nwith friends underground!\cIf you manage to steal a Flag from\na friend's Secret Base, you be sure\rto come show me!
Wait! Don't tell me!\nYou've captured a Flag?\cExcellent! You should already be\ncapable of moving Big Boulders\rinside your Secret Base!\cYou can shunt aside a boulder by\nstoring it like furniture.\cAnyway, well done!\nThis is your reward!\c
There really is nothing else that\nI can teach you.\cIf you wish to put away more Big\nBoulders or put out more goods,\rkeep capturing more Flags.\cBecome the spelunking master for me!
So, my spelunker, are you going\nunderground with your friends?\cThe underground tunnels are vast.\nThey can be a place where you meet\cmany others like you.
Ah, you've captured three Flags!\cWell done!\nTake this as your reward!\c
Ah, you've captured ten Flags!\cWell done!\nTake this as your reward!\c
Oh! Oh! My goodness!\nYou've captured fifty Flags!\cFantastic!\nTake this as your reward!\c
You have been outstanding! There\nreally is nothing left to teach you.\cFrom now on, you are the spelunking\nmaster!
Oh? Your underground PC appears\nto be full.\cDiscard a decorative item or two,\nthen come see me again.
Hm!\nThis belongs to you!\c
The underground tunnels go\neverywhere!\cGrab your friends and let's play\ntogether using DS Wireless\rCommunications!
All I ever unearth are Armor Fossils.\nMy buddy only digs up Skull Fossils.\rI wonder why that happens?\cIt doesn't matter though. I can just\nswap them with my buddy.\cI simply let a Pokémon hold an Armor\nFossil and trade it to him.
Let's dig up some Treasure!\cI'm from Oreburgh.\nI work at the mining museum there.\cI got advice from the Underground\nMan on digging up Treasure and Spheres.\cBefore I get digging, let me share\nhis advice with you.\cWhile you're digging, you may uncover\ndark rocks.\cThey are very hard! If you keep\nhitting them, the wall will collapse.\cDon't forget that, and you'll be\ndigging up Treasure in no time!
Oh, you'd like more advice on digging\nup Treasure and Spheres?\cWell, your Explorer Kit contains\na sledgehammer and a pickax.\cChoose either of these tools and\ntouch the lower screen to dig.\cYou get to keep the stuff you fully\nuncover before the wall collapses.\cDon't forget, the dark rocks are\nimpossible to break.\cIf you hit them too often, the wall\nwill collapse.\cDon't forget that, and you'll be\ndigging up Treasure in no time!
New and on sale!\nUnderground Radar!\cThe upper radar screen indicates\npossible Treasure locations.\cThe lower Touch Radar indicates\nprecise locations!

Spheres: In the underground tunnels,\nyou can dig up pretty stones that\rare called Spheres.\cThere are people underground that\ntreat Spheres like money.\cTrade them your Spheres in exchange\nfor decoration goods and other items.\cThese Spheres also have the strange\nproperty of growing if they are\rburied in the ground.\c
Traps: There are Traps that can be\nput down in the underground tunnels.\cThere are many kinds of Traps for\nunwary Trainers under the ground.\cSome Traps need to be blown away.\nSome need to be removed by touch.\c
Goods: These are furniture and\ndecorative items for Secret Bases.\cCollect goods by exchanging Spheres for\nthem, or by getting gifts from friends!\c
Treasure: These are rare items that\nappear while digging underground.\cThey can be taken out of the\nUnderground if placed in your Bag\rwhile in the tunnels.\cDig around all over and find\nTreasure!\c

Hey, there!\nHow's it going, Trainer?\cYou being here tells me you're going\nto challenge the Gym Leader.\cWell... I hate to break it to you, but\nthat's impossible.\cYou're questioning why, and the answer\nis: she's not here.\cNot to worry, though.\nWe know she's at the Contest Hall.\cCome back another time, OK?\nI'll be waiting right here.
[VAR 0103(0000,0000)]: Ta-daah!\nKept me waiting again, [VAR 0103(0001,0000)]!\cLet's see how much tougher you and\nI have gotten, right here and now!\cHey, you're a Trainer now. You're\nexpected to be ready for a battle.\cNo whining! No waiting!\nLet's get the show started!\c

You're a Trainer, are you?\cYou've got two choices of challenges,\neither the Gym or a Contest, right?
At the Lost Tower, people unburden\nthemselves of unbearable sorrow...\cYou'll understand what I mean if you\nvisit the Lost Tower on Route 209.
This place is beautiful.\nPerhaps even too much so.\cPokémon, people, and nature are in\nperfect harmony here.
I can't decide what Accessories I\nshould dress up Pokémon with.\cThere are just so many kinds.
I get to see Pokémon all day long,\nbut there sure are many kinds.\cHow many are there now?
I used a Fire Stone on my Pokémon,\nand it evolved!
I'm visiting here all the way from\nthe Hoenn region.\cI had been hoping to find the Contest\nHall, but being new, I lost my way.\cFortunately, the local people very\nkindly led me to my destination.\cI was impressed by their kindness and\ngenerosity to a complete stranger.\cNow, may I offer you the courtesy\nof showing you to the Contest Hall?
Ah.\nPlease follow me.\c
This is the Contest Hall.\nPlease, do go inside.
It makes me happy knowing I've\nhelped another person.

I have a professor friend, and this is\nwhat he told me.\cIf you leave a pair of Pokémon with the\nDay Care, sometimes Eggs are found.\cOr things that are like Eggs, anyway.\cI wonder how my pal Prof. Elm is doing\nthese days?\cHe was always a quiet sort and didn't\nreally stand out.
They call me Mr. Goods.\cNo one knows my real name.\nNo, not even I do...\cI dedicate myself to seeking rarities.\nIt's what I live for.\c

If I were to give a\nSweet Poffin, the Pokémon eating it\rwould become more cute!\cFor example! A Spicy Poffin will add\nto the coolness of a Pokémon!\cIn such ways I say that Poffins have\nnothing but goodness for Pokémon!\cTherefore!\cI declare this Poffin Case to be\na gift from me to you!\c
I urge you to fill it with Poffins\nand be generous in dispensing them\rto your Pokémon!
Nationwide, there are other fan\nclubs, but we are number one!\cAnd why are we number one?\nBecause I brag more than anyone!\cBut now I can't brag as much...\cPeople started complaining, so\nI've had to curtail my bragging...

For the Visual judging, you want to\ndress up your Pokémon nicely with\rAccessories matched to the theme.\cThat means you'll be at an advantage\nif you have lots of Accessories.
For the Dance competition, your\nPokémon needs to perfectly mimic\rthe dance steps of the lead dancer.
For the performance aspect of\nContests, Pokémon need the right\rkinds of moves.\cBut what's even more important is\nyour choice of the Judge.\cIf everyone performs for the same\nJudge, your Pokémon leaves less of\ran impression on that Judge.
At the Cool Contest you gotta pull\noff a cool move!\rGets the Judges all excited!\cIf the Judge's excitement peaks, you\nscore massive bonus points! So hot!

That people are lonely is only natural.\nIt gives me compassion for others.\cIt's what makes me look forward to\na better tomorrow.\cBut there are still moments of\nfondness for the past.\rThough, time can heal some sadness...

Pokémon... People... It's only natural\nthat we are all so very different.\cMake sure that you never judge\na Pokémon on if it's weak or strong.\cYou must always look for the good\ninside of them. That's what counts!
If the strong and able do too much,\nthey limit the contributions of others.\cThe strong must show restraint.\cThis enables everyone to live together\nand share responsibility.
We cannot read the minds of others,\nwhich causes us to feel fear and doubt.\cBut to control the aspects of the world\nbeyond our senses is an impossibility.\n

[VAR 0103(0000,0000)]: Heh, yeah, maybe you\ndid get a bit tougher since last time.\cThat even shocked me a bit, so yeah,\nI got beat 'cause I was careless.\cSo, hey, what was that Team Galactic\nguy all freaking out about?\cI don't know what he's up to, but\nyou should chase him down!\cIf you're not a Pokémon, and you run\nlike that... You're a bad guy.\cAll right, [VAR 0103(0001,0000)]!\nNext time, I'm not holding back!\c

[VAR 0103(0000,0000)]: Oh, hey!\nYou got the Gym Badge here, huh?\cWhat'd I tell you? Mr. Wake--I mean,\nthe master--is pretty awesome, hey?\c
Wake: What's this racket, then?\nOh, it's you two.\c
[VAR 0103(0000,0000)]: Oh, Master!\c
Wake: ...Listen, kid.\nI know your father. I won't deny that.\cBut I don't recall ever taking you on\nas an apprentice. Not in the least.\c
Besides, you two don't need me.\cYou can become strong on your own\nwithout being my apprentice.\c
[VAR 0103(0000,0000)]: It doesn't matter.\nI made you my master! I decided!\cBut forget that!\nThere's trouble brewing!\cThere's a Team Galactic goon in front \nof the Observatory Gate.\cHe said something about using a bomb!\c
Wake: WHAAAAT?!\cNo one messes with Pastoria!\nNot on my watch!\c
[VAR 0103(0000,0000)]: Hey!\nMaster! Wait!\c
[VAR 0103(0000,0000)]: Does my new outfit look\ngood or what? CROAGUNK's where it's at.
[VAR 0103(0000,0000)]: Why are you talking to\nme from there?!\c

Wake: YOU!\nWhat've you done?!\c
Grunt: What've I done, you're asking?\nWell, technically speaking, it wasn't me.\cThe package that arrived, see, that\nwas a bomb, named the Galactic Bomb.\cMe, I was told to push the button.\nSo I did. Like, “Poink!”\cOh, that's right! Mustn't forget!\nThe test results need reporting!\cCheerio, then!\nYou daft codger, your mask's absurd!\c
Wake: The Great Marsh is invaluable...\c
You two! Do NOT follow me!\nDon't let anyone else in, either!\cThere'd be big trouble if there's any\nof that bomb left!\c
[VAR 0103(0000,0000)]: Hey! [VAR 0103(0001,0000)]!\nYou go after that Galactic goon!\cI'm staying here like Master said!\nGotta keep others from going in!\cDon't let that Galactic guy get away!
[VAR 0103(0000,0000)]: What's the matter?!\nWhy aren't you gone already?!\cGo after that Galactic goon!\c
[VAR 0103(0000,0000)]: What's the matter?!\nWhy aren't you gone already?!\cGo after that Galactic goon!
What's with you?\nStop chasing after me, you.\cI've half a mind to pulverize you with\nmy Pokémon!\cBut I have to be on my way to the\nlake ASAP! So, you're lucky! I'm out!\cAll right, do I make myself clear?\nDon't you dare follow me!\c
Here where I am standing, I'm\nsmack-dab in the middle of town.
I study rare Pokémon that appear\nonly in the Great Marsh.
Some Trainers deliberately prevent\ntheir Pokémon from evolving.\cThey wait until the Pokémon levels up\nand learns certain moves.
I'm visiting here to see the Great\nMarsh.\cI'm staying at the lakeside hotel.
Pastoria's Gym Leader is awesome with\nhis water attacks.\cYou'll know what I mean when you\nchallenge him.
Wasn't the Pastoria Gym Leader kind of\nawesome in all sorts of ways?\cBut don't judge him by the way he looks\nand acts.\cI hear he enters professional\nwrestling matches for prize money.\cThat money goes to help people and\nPokémon in trouble.
The Great Marsh keeps the weather\ncool in the summertime.\cThis is a good town for Water-type\nPokémon.
CLEFAIRY: Fiiih?!
You're just like a totally impatient\nboy I met earlier.\cJust like you, he was very close with\nhis Pokémon.\cHey, thanks for making me smile!\nThis might put a smile on your face.\cTry dressing up a Pokémon with\nthis [VAR 011F(0000,0000)].\c
Someone gave me a Berry, so I\nplanted it and grew some more.\cThen, I took the Berries and cooked\nthem into Poffins.\cAll the work is worth it when I see\nhow happy they make my Pokémon!
I can't use the hidden move Surf until\nI beat the local Gym Leader.
Have you been to the Pokémon Mansion?\nIt's on Route 212.\cThe owner, Mr. Backlot, likes to brag\nabout his herd of rare Pokémon.

The Gym Leader Wake... Uh, I mean\nCrasher Wake, is a master of\rWater-type Pokémon.\cI'd say you've got guts if you try\nto face down Water types with Fire-\ror Ground-type Pokémon!\cBut that part I'll leave up to you!\nGo and have some good battles!

You're not interested in Idols?\n...I think I'm going to cry.

That's it! A COMBEE!\nIt's sooooo cute!\cIt'd be even cooler if you had the\nother gender COMBEE as well, though.\cBy the way, a female COMBEE's kind of\nrare, so they're popular.\cStill, it'd be great to see a male and\nfemale at the same time.\cI'll give you a Macho Brace if you do\nthat for me.

Looker: ...Yes, I see your point.\cSneaking into the hideout of the Team\nGalactic...it is daunting.
Looker: [VAR 0103(0000,0000)]!\c
We have the Hidden Machine that teaches\nFly stored in the warehouse.\cThey said I can use it if I show them\nthat I deserve it.
Yeah, Team Galactic is hiding all sorts\nof good stuff in their warehouse.\cI hear they even have a Hidden\nMachine in there!
The Game Corner is dangerous!\cWhy is it dangerous?\nIt's so fun, I lose track of time!
I got a TM as a prize from the\nGame Corner.\cI used it on my Pokémon right away!
Maylene is Veilstone's Gym Leader.\nThen, there's Wake in Pastoria...\cThey're way too tough for me.\nI can't even come close to them.
I came to this city just so I could\ngo shopping at the department store.\cBut with all these rock walls around,\nthis place feels kind of cold.
I bought a new parasol.\cBut I don't want it to get rained on,\nso I watch the TV weather reports.
Do you know where one might find\na Coin Case?\cI heard that there's a clown giving\n'em away, but...
Veilstone is the city of stone.\nWe even have meteorites!\cThis has nothing to do with anything,\nbut take this Technical Machine!\c
If someone uses Embargo on your\nPokémon, it becomes impossible to\ruse any items on it.\cAnyway, enjoy your visit to Veilstone,\nthe city of...well, stone.
Salut, Trainer!\nTu aimes les Pokémon?
Moi aussi!\nC'est génial!
J'ai du mal à te croire...\nIl n'y a qu'à vous regarder!

Hello.\nI'm pleased to meet you.\cI'm Maylene, and I'm the Gym\nLeader.\cI don't really know what it means to\nbe strong, or how I got to be the\rGym Leader.\cBut I will do the best I can as the\nGym Leader.\cI take battling very seriously.\nWhenever you're ready!\c
...OK.\nYou win.\cThat was a tough loss.\nI learned a lot from it.\cPlease, accept this Gym Badge.\c
[VAR 0103(0000,0000)] received\nthe Cobble Badge from Maylene.
Um... I should explain about that\nofficial Pokémon League Gym Badge.\cWith it, you can use the hidden move Fly\noutside of battle.\cOh, and since you now have four Gym\nBadges, Pokémon obtained in trades\rwill obey you up to Lv. 50.\cOh, and please take this as well.\c
That [VAR 0108(0000,0000)] contains the move\n[VAR 0106(0001,0000)].\cUm... That move inflicts damage,\nand it robs the target's HP.
Gee, I'm hungry...\cOh, sorry, it's nothing.\nI didn't say anything.\c[VAR 0103(0000,0000)], I can't explain what\nit means to be strong.\cI don't know how much effort goes\ninto being strong...\cBut being with Pokémon lets us\nkeep making the effort, doesn't it?
Hey, there!\nHow's it going, Champ-to-be?\cThe Gym Leader is a user of\nFighting-type Pokémon.\cShe'd be a terror against Normal-type\nPokémon.\cBut! And it's a big but!\nJust between you and me...\cMaylene, the Gym Leader, said Flying-\nand Psychic-type Pokémon could be\rreal trouble for her!\cIf you want to battle her, smack the\npunching bags along the rails.\cYou have to hit those bags hard!
Oh! [VAR 0103(0000,0000)]!\nYou've beaten the Gym Leader!\cOf course, I thought you'd win.

Maylene, the Gym Leader, is a cute\ngirl.\cBut don't let her looks fool you.\nEven grown-ups have trouble with her.
Two Pokémon! If you had two Pokémon,\nwe'd get a great shot here.
Oh! You're ready for a battle\nwith us?
You're live on camera, but try to act\nnatural, OK?\c
OK, that's how it is, huh.\nCan't do anything about that.
I'd like to take that footage and\nbroadcast it worldwide.
Oh, no. What we really want to see\nis you battling using two Pokémon!
Giggle!\nWill you have a battle with us?
We'll thoroughly check out your\nabilities as a Trainer!\c

Did you want some Coins for the\nslots?\cOh, I'm sorry, you don't have\na Coin Case to hold your Coins.
Did you want some game Coins?\cIt's $1000 for 50 Coins.\nWould you like some?
Thank you very much!\nHere are your Coins!
Um... You don't appear to have\nenough money...
Oh?\nYour Coin Case is full.
Oh... You don't need Coins, then?\nPlease come again!
Ten straight bonus rounds on\nthe slots! That's amazing!\cI would say you had an explosion\nof good luck!\cSo, please take this Technical Machine\nas a memento!\c
Please keep playing the slots for\nanother explosion of good luck!
Oh, your Bag is full...\nWe will hold the TM for you.
We're still amazed by your ten straight\nbonus rounds on the slots before.\cI would say you had an explosion\nof good luck!\cSo, please take this Technical Machine\nas a memento!\c
You can't play if you don't have\na Coin Case.
I'll explain how the slot machines\nwork at this Game Corner.\cDuring regular play, you should\nstop the reels from the left.\cDuring the bonus round, watch\nwhere CLEFAIRY points and stop\rthe reels in that order.
Hey, kid, if you want to play here,\nyou need a Coin Case.\cI think the young man next door\nhad one.
I've been winning a ton today.\nHere, take some Coins!\c[VAR 0103(0000,0000)] received 20 Coins\nfrom the man.\c[VAR 0103(0000,0000)] put the Coins away in\nthe Coin Case.
Listen, when CLEFAIRY appears, that's\nyour chance to line up sevens.\cLine those babies up and you're into\nthe bonus round!
Woohoo! CLEFAIRY! Look at it!\nIt's driving me bananas!\cOh, if only you had a Coin Case!\nThen you'd know what fun this is!
Woohoo! CLEFAIRY! Look!\nYeahah! It's a carnival!\cLet me share some of my joy with\nyou!\c[VAR 0103(0000,0000)] received 50 Coins\nfrom the man.\c[VAR 0103(0000,0000)] put the Coins away in\nthe Coin Case.
Woohoo! CLEFAIRY! It's adorable!\nJust seeing it gets my pulse racing!\cOh, let me impart a piece of advice\nto you!\cIf the moon turns red, you don't\nwant to get a replay because it\rmakes CLEFAIRY tired!
I want Coins, of course, but\nsetting records is hot, too!
When a Poké Ball appears, it's a\nchance to line up slot marks.\cReplays and PIKACHU line up even if\nyou don't make an effort.\cBut you need to aim for better marks,\nlike Poké Balls and Moon Stones.
A friend in my group scored a ton of\nCoins here.\cWhy mess with a good thing?\nI'll try the same spot, too!
Sigh...\nNothing's going my way today...\cAre you a Trainer?\nDid you battle the Gym Leader?\cShe happens to be my daughter.\nShe's some kind of tough!
Looker: Ah, it is you, yes.\cExamine, if you will, the reels.\nThe Team Galactic logo, it is here.\cFurther investigation is needed, and\nI am just the man to do it.\cAlso, where the masses gather, so too\ndoes information.\c...Ack. My streak is broken.
Looker: Ah, it is you, yes.\cI have decided to use the opportunity\nof being here in Sinnoh.\cI am therefore trying to teach moves\nto Pokémon that I have captured.\cAlso, if I have nothing to do, it means\nthe world, it is at peace.\c...Ack. My streak is broken.
Shoot for 10!\nLine up those bonus rounds!\cIf you accomplish the feat of completing\n10 uninterrupted bonus rounds,\rplease go to the counter.\cYou will be presented with a fabulous\nprize!\cThe current record sits at\n[VAR 0134(0000,0000)] straight bonus rounds!

Jasmine: ...Was that your friend?\cSeeing how you two got along made me\nhappy somehow.\cIt must be wonderful having a friend\nlike that.\cA person that you can share anything\nand everything with.\cA person you can compete with\nwithout fighting.\c...Um, it made me feel sort of warm\nseeing you two.\cIt may seem odd, but I'd like you to\nhave this as my thanks.\c

[VAR 0103(0000,0000)]: Hold it!\nDon't go off without me!\cYou're challenging the Pokémon League,\naren't you?\cThat's why I'm here, too.\cLet's see who's more worthy of making\nthe challenge with a battle!\c
[VAR 0103(0000,0000)]: I guess I'm not ready\nfor the Pokémon League if I'm losing\rto you!\cDarn it!\nYou watch, though!\cI'll get tougher and win my way\nthrough the Pokémon League!\cBecause I'm going to become the\nChampion, the toughest Trainer!\c[VAR 0103(0001,0000)]! You'd better not lose to\nanyone before me!\c
Let me confirm that you are qualified\nto challenge the Pokémon League.\cSo! Let us examine the Gym Badges\nyou gathered from Sinnoh.\cOreburgh City's Coal Badge!\cEterna City's Forest Badge!\cHearthome City's Relic Badge!\cVeilstone City's Cobble Badge!\cPastoria City's Fen Badge!\cCanalave City's Mine Badge!\cSnowpoint City's Icicle Badge!\cAnd...\nSunyshore City's Beacon Badge!\c
Very well!\cTrainer, you've indeed collected\nall the Gym Badges of Sinnoh!\cDemonstrate the power that brought\nyou here and go for glory!
You will be facing the Elite Four\nof the Pokémon League.\cIf you can't beat all four of them\nin a row, you have to start from\rthe first one again.
It doesn't matter if the going is slow.\cNor does it matter how many challenges\nit takes.\cI'm never giving up!\nNot until I beat the Elite Four!
What is the Pokémon League?\nDon't take my word for it.\cTake the challenge and experience it\nfor yourself!

Hello!\nWelcome to the Pokémon League!\cI'm Aaron of the Elite Four.\nIt's good to meet you.\cOh, I should explain, I'm a huge fan\nof bug Pokémon.\cBug Pokémon are nasty-mean, and yet\nthey're beautiful, too...\cWould you like to know why I take\non challengers here?\cIt's because I want to become\nperfect, just like my bug Pokémon!\cOK! Let me take you on!\c
I lost with the most beautiful and\ntoughest of the bug Pokémon...\cWe lost because I wasn't good\nenough...\cThat's it! Back to training camp!\nLet's hear it for me!\cNo... That was wrong... Anyway...\nGo on to the next room!\cThree Trainers are waiting for you.\nThey're all tougher than me.
Go on, go to the next room.\cI'm going to become a top-level\nTrainer who can't be outclassed with\rmy beautiful and tough bug Pokémon!

Well, well.\cYou're quite the adorable Trainer,\nbut you've also got a spine.\cAhaha!\nI'm Bertha.\cI have a preference for Ground-type\nPokémon.\cWell, would you show this old lady\nhow much you've learned?\c
You're quite something, youngster.\cI like how you and your Pokémon\nearned the win by working as one.\cThat's what makes you so strong.\cAhahaha! I think that you can\ngo as far as you want.
The Trainer in the next room is a\nmuch more formidable opponent.\cYou really must have your wits\nabout you.\cHowever, I think you can go as far\nas you desire. Ahahaha!

Yo, Trainer!\cYou had me counting the days on my\nfingers waiting for you to come.\cI heard from Volkner what you \ndid in Sunyshore.\cYou managed to light a fire in that\nguy's heart again.\cHow could you not expect me to look\nforward to seeing you in battle?\c
You're facing a Fire-type Pokémon\nuser with me.\cLet Flint see how hot your spirit\nburns!\c
...\n...\c...\n...\c...\n...\c...Whew...\n...Burnt right down to cinders...
...\n...\c...\n...\c...\n...\c...Keep going...
I was waiting for you, challenger!\cFlint, the master of the Fire type,\nis up next!\cBattles are clashes of the burning\nspirit of Pokémon.\cBattles aren't about appearances\nor what's weak or strong.\cIt all comes down to whether the\ncombatants can burn hot or not.\c
...\n...\c...Whew...\n...Burnt right down to cinders...
...\n...\c...Keep going...\cI know your spirit burns hot.\nYour whole team does.

Ah, you timed your arrival well.\cI've just finished reading a book,\nyou see.\cAllow me to introduce myself.\cI am Lucian.\nI am a user of the Psychic type.\cI must say, you've already proven\nyourself to be outstanding by coming\rthis far.\cThey say I am the toughest of the\nElite Four.\cI'm afraid I will have to go all out\nagainst you to live up to that\rreputation.\c
Congratulations.\nYou've now beaten the Elite Four.\cHowever, that doesn't mean you're\ndone with the Pokémon League.\cThere remains the Champion.\cI should warn you--the Champion is\nfar stronger than the Elite Four.\cNow, go on. Step through the\ndoorway to your final battle.
I'll be reading books until the next\nchallenger arrives.\cThat will calm my nerves, so that\nI may deal with all situations without\rpanicking.

[VAR 0103(0000,0000)]: Oh, hey, [VAR 0103(0001,0000)]!\nWhat took you so long?\rI'm fining you $100 million!\cActually, never mind the fine.\nCome with me, will ya?\c
[VAR 0103(0000,0000)]: [VAR 0103(0001,0000)], I tried to\nget into the Battle Frontier,\rwhich happens to be right here.\cThen these guys came along and got in\nmy face about it.\cLike, they're saying they want to test\nme if I'm good enough and all that.\cLike, as if I need to prove anything.\nSo, let's team up.\cLike we did at the Spear Pillar.\nLet's show those guys how good we are!\c
[VAR 0103(0000,0000)]: Yeah, that's what I'm\ntalking about!\cSo there's an Elite Four and a Gym\nLeader. We can whoop 'em!\c
[VAR 0103(0000,0000)]: Hey, seriously, can I say\nsomething?\cWhat's all that about?\nToss me a bone here!\cCome on, I'm stuck here.\nI need your help!
[VAR 0103(0000,0000)]: Come on, let's show them\nhow tough we really are!
Flint: Yo, Trainer!\nIt's been too long, amigo!\cNow I don't know what your pal speedy\nthere's been spouting...\cBut we're not doing this out of spite\nor anything bad natured like that.\cThe Battle Frontier behind us is where\nthe best Trainers gather.\cWe're being kind enough to let you\nsee if you're up to the challenge!\cYou really ought to be grateful!
Volkner: You only want to go into the\nFrontier, don't you?\cI'm sorry about my friend.\nHe's off on his own thing...
Flint: This situation just cooks!\nThe drama and tension sizzles!\cFlint, the fiery master of fire Pokémon,\nis going to put you to the test!\rLet Flint see how hot your spirit burns!\c
Volkner: I don't know how I managed to\nget myself into this, but...\cShow me the skills that got you through\nthe Pokémon League!\c
Flint: ...\n...\c...\n...\c...\n...\c
Volkner: Hey! Don't burn out on us!\nNow you're just getting in the way.\c
Volkner: Hahaha!\nThat was a blast!\cOur combination came up short, but\nyou're also a lot tougher as well.\cPromise me we'll do this again.\nI'll see to taking this husk home.\c
[VAR 0103(0000,0000)]: See?\nI got a lot tougher, yeah?\cOK, I'm off to the Fronti...\c
[VAR FF01(00C8)]Thud!![VAR FF01(0064)]\c
What's this all about?!\c
[VAR 0103(0000,0000)]: What the...\c[VAR FF01(00C8)]...Daddy?![VAR FF01(0064)]\c
Palmer: Huh? Ah!\cIf it isn't [VAR 0103(0000,0000)]!\nYou've grown all sturdy!\cAnd [VAR 0103(0001,0000)], too! I haven't\nseen you in a long time, either!\c
[VAR 0103(0000,0000)], your mother told me\nyou'd gone off to the Battle Zone.\cSo I had to come running looking for\nyou.\cSo, are you two going to take the\nBattle Frontier challenge?\cThe Frontier has five facilities that\nare all dedicated to battling.\cEach one has a unique set of rules,\nso they're all different.\cOf course, you have to be good to win\nat any of them.\cAnyway, I'm satisfied to see that\nyou're both doing well.\cI'll go back to my usual place in the\nBattle Tower.\cI'll be looking forward to your\nchallenge.\c
[VAR 0103(0000,0000)]: My dad is cool, huh?\nI mean, when it gets right down to it.\rYou think so too, right?\cHe's a Frontier Brain, after all.\nHe's the Tower Tycoon!\cI want to be cool like my dad!\c[VAR 0103(0001,0000)], that's the one reason\nI decided to become a Trainer!\c
Ooh, what am I going to do?\cShould I make the challenge now?\nOr do I train some more?\c
OK! I've decided!\nI'm going to get tougher! By a lot!\cI finally made it here!\nThere's no need for haste now.\c
Who are you guys?\cWhat makes an Elite Four and a Gym\nLeader want to take you on?
Hey, hey.\nI just watched you two battle.\cYou're something special, aren't you?\nBeating an Elite Four like that.\cOh, right, howdy.\nThe name's Buck.\cI'm usually training at the Survival\nArea or Stark Mountain.\cYou should come up there.\nYou'll get toughened up for sure!\c
Anyways, howdy, I'm Buck.\nSheesh, that punk can't beat me.\cSo, do you know that zippity-doodah\nof a Trainer?\cYou should chase after that guy\nand tell him not to underestimate\rthe volcano.\cOh, but you know what?\cYou'd better shape up at the\nBattle Tower first, too.\cI don't like your chances of getting\nto the volcano, otherwise.\cBe seeing you!\c
You can learn a lot by watching other\nTrainers battle.\cI can't wait to cast my eyes on a battle\nwith an Elite Four and a Gym Leader!
I can't believe I'm going to see a\nbattle involving the best Trainers!\cThat's what I get for living right in\nfront of the Frontier.\cI must be lucky!
There's a lot to think about in any\ntwo-on-two battle.\cIt puts the focus on the Trainer's\nknowledge and skills.
Are Volkner and Flint really good\nfriends?\cI've heard all they ever do is argue\nand bicker.
An Elite Four and a Gym Leader...\nThat combination's intriguing!
Howdy, Trainer!\nYou have a Pokédex, do you?\cThe person who gave you that must be\nwaiting for you to fill it completely.
Howdy, Trainer!\nHave you been to the Battle Frontier?\cIt's a good place to learn about the\nintricacies of battling.\cLike how certain Pokémon can battle\nwith certain moves and so on.
The way the Battle Tower looms...\cIt really is a wall that stands\nbefore every Trainer.
                                             
I've battled many Trainers over\nthe years.\cI've gained some confidence in my\nskill levels, too.\cBut the world is still a huge place.\nIt's not easy to win in life!
Because of the volcano, the land\naround here is craggy.\cThe rough terrain and all the ups\nand downs make it hard to hike.
The Pokémon League's Elite Four\ncome here sometimes!
Your Pokémon are from Sinnoh,\naren't they?\cThey're not what we're used to\nseeing around here.
There's no end to becoming tough!\cI just made that up, but it sounds\nkind of cool, huh?
What's up? Do you want to sail to\nSnowpoint City?
Aye, right!\nIt's anchors aweigh, then!\c
Oh, right. You'd rather just fly\neverywhere in some big hurry.
Whenever I go to a new place, I get\nexcited over what I might discover.\cBut places I've visited before...\cEven those places thrill me with\nnew discoveries!
Hmm!\nA Super Rod is really good!\cWouldn't you agree?
Hmm!\nWe're of identical minds!\cHmm!\nTake this [VAR 0108(0000,0000)]!\c
Wherever there's water, try your\nluck at fishing.
Don't you like to fish?
What's that?\nAny advice for fishing?\cWell, I'll tell you.\nIt's all about the rod and technique!

[VAR 0103(0000,0000)]: ...!\nIt's OK, though.\c[VAR 0103(0001,0000)], the tougher you get,\nthe tougher we can get, too.\cThere's no end to Pokémon.\nThat's what I'm saying, [VAR 0103(0001,0000)].

The Battle Zone used to attract only\nthe hardiest of the Trainers.\cThey were considered eccentric for\ngathering at a place like this.\cIt's hard to believe how much it's\nchanged since then.\cPlaces like the Fight Area and the\nSurvival Area just seemed to spring\rup overnight.
He was one of those early eccentrics\nwho were around during the early days\cof the Battle Zone. Well, I was too.
TORCHIC: Chiic chic!
I am the Item Expert!\nI have mastery in the way of items!\cYour Pokémon...\nDo they hold items?\cThe better the item they hold, the \nstronger they become.\cThere are items that are worthy of my\nrecommendation. Care to know?\c
Which item would you like me to\ndescribe?
There's a great variety of other items,\nof course.\cThe kinds of items to be held will also\ndepend on your battle strategy.\cAll I can say in conclusion is that\nyou'll never know until you try!
Lum Berry!\cWhen held by a Pokémon, it instantly\nheals status problems.\cLike sleep, paralysis, confusion, that\nsort of thing.\cIt's a berry, though, so it's gone if\nit's used.\c
Focus Sash!\cThis hold item will prevent a Pokémon\nwith full HP from a one-hit KO.\cThe holding Pokémon will survive an\nattack like that leaving just one HP.\cBeing able to get one turn in has huge\nimplications for battle strategists!\c
Expert Belt!\cThis hold item boosts the power of a\nsuper-effective move to 120%.\cIt'd be useful for a Pokémon that knows\ndifferent types of moves.\c
Life Orb!\cThis hold item boosts the power of\nall the Pokémon's moves to 130%!\cHowever! It also takes 10% of the\nholder's HP every time a move is used.\c
Choice Scarf!\cThis hold item boosts the Speed of the\nPokémon to 150%!\cHowever, and beware of this, it will\nonly allow one move to be used.\c
Choice Band!\cThis hold item boosts the Attack stat\nof the Pokémon to 150%.\cBeware, it has no effect on the Special\nAttack stat. Make no mistake of it.\c
Choice Specs!\cThis hold item boosts the Special Attack\nstat of the Pokémon to 150%.\cBeware, it has no effect on the Attack\nstat. Make no mistake of it.\c
Leftovers!\cAt the end of a turn, after both sides\nhave made their moves, this hold item\rrestores HP by about 6%.\cThe recovered HP could well be the\ndifference in a tight battle.\c

Darach: Your mastery of Pokémon is as\nbreathtaking as ever.\c[VAR 0103(0000,0000)], you certainly are to be\ncommended.\c...However, if I may say so, I noticed\nsomething about the way you battle.\cAfter all, I have had the opportunity\nto watch you closely firsthand.\cSo, what is it that I noticed?\cAs a Trainer myself, it is but proper\netiquette to show you in a battle.\cLet us begin!\nEn garde!\c
Darach: [VAR 0103(0000,0000)], you are truly in\npossession of a superlative talent!\cI drew on every reserve of experience\nand etiquette handed down through\rour heritage of glorious servitude.\cBut even then, I failed to fend off your\ninspired and inspiring challenge.\cI shall see to appeasing Lady Caitlin's\ndispleasure at my loss.\c[VAR 0103(0000,0000)], please do return to our\nBattle Castle.\cWe will be delighted and honored to have\nyou back!\c
Darach: I am humbled...\cWhat I'd perceived to be a weakness\nwas only illusory...\cOr, perhaps you corrected it in the\ncourse of our battle.\cRegardless, your performance was\nstunning again.\cThough she cannot say it, Lady Caitlin\nappears quite taken by your style.\cFor her sake at the very least, please\ndo return to our Battle Castle!\c

Hi, can we feature you in a news piece\nwe're doing?\cAll you have to do is battle with me.\nWill you do that?
Reporter Kinsey's live interview!\c
Unbelievable! Press coverage denied!\nI find you intriguing, too...
To get people to open up, we approach\nthem honestly with no hidden tricks.\cIt's like the relationship between\nPokémon and Trainers, isn't it?
I've spotted a charismatic Trainer!\nIs it OK to go for the scoop?
As a professional cameraman, I always\ngo for the best shot!\c
That's a downer...\cI thought I'd found a Trainer and\nPokémon who'd shine on camera.
The lively expressions on you and your\nPokémon's faces...\cIt sure makes for some great TV!
Are we all ready to have some fun?\nI sure am! Aren't you having fun?!\rLet's make it fun! OK?!
OK, how shall we do this?\nShall we do something fantastical?\c
Oh, how shall I say this...?\nIt makes me all lonely, I say...
A clown's makeup is a face that's\ncrying while laughing. Mwahahah!\cIt defines what we do!
Come on, let's show off our Pokémon!\nLet's do battle, kiddo!
Your spirit's vibes...\nYou've got rock in your veins!\c
My guitar...\nIt lies broken and weeping...
Pokémon and rock and roll are all\nanyone needs to survive this world!
Hi, I'm Grace, the Idol! I'm just back\nfrom a show in Oreburgh Mine!\cSo, shall we battle?
I'll let you join my fan club if you can\nbeat me!\c
You won't accept my challenge?!\nBut I'm an Idol...
Well, that's me and my Pokémon!\nI hope you'll support us!\cJust so you know, our latest single is\ntitled “Jigglin' Pokémon Wub”!
Two Pokémon!\nThat's what we need.\cWe're looking for a Trainer who's\ntraveling with at least two Pokémon.
Oh! Would you like to battle against the\nboth of us?
You're live on camera, but try to act\nnatural, OK?\c
OK, that's how it is, huh.\nCan't do anything about that.
Whee!\nWasn't that battle smoking hot?\cYou should make a Battle Video of it and\nshare it with the world!
Oh, dear!\nYou only have one Pokémon with you?\cThat's very commendable, but we can't\nbattle with you that way.
Giggle!\nCould you win against both of us?
We'll thoroughly check out your\nabilities as a Trainer!\c
Oh? You haven't healed your Pokémon,\nmaybe?
That was a good match.\cIt adds flair and drama when many\neager Pokémon get involved.
We're doing a news piece on Trainers.\nCan we get you to participate?\cIf we can, we'd like to see how strong\nyou are in a battle!
Jubilife TV!\nOn-the-spot live report!\c
...Are you one of those contrary\npeople who reply “No” first thing?
Why Trainers choose certain kinds of\nPokémon and their feelings about it...\cThat's what we're investigating.
I felt a flash of inspiration when I laid\neyes on you.\cI'd really love to capture you on\ncamera while you're battling.
For close-ups, I need to get in tight.\nYou don't mind, do you?\c
That's a downer...\cI thought I'd found a Trainer and\nPokémon who'd shine on camera.
So, did you come to Hearthome to\ncompete in Contests?
Would you like to battle with me?\nAs a memento of your visit to Pastoria?
I'll let you join my fan club if you can\nbeat me!\c
You're not interested in Idols?\n...I think I'm going to cry.
Well, that's me and my Pokémon!\nI hope you'll support us!\cJust so you know, our latest single is\ntitled “Jigglin' Pokémon Wub”!
Are we all ready to have some fun?\nOur battle will be fun! OK?!
OK, how shall we do this?\nShall we do something fantastical?\c
Oh, how shall I say this...?\nIt makes me all lonely, I say...
Well, let's see!\nWhich town will we go to next?
Come on, let's show off our Pokémon!\nLet's do battle, kiddo!
Your spirit's vibes...\nYou've got rock in your veins!\c
My guitar...\nIt lies broken and weeping...
Rock is about your spirit!\nBattling is about spirit, too!\rThat's why a battle is rock!
Two Pokémon! If you had two Pokémon,\nwe'd get a great shot here.
Oh! You're ready for a battle\nwith us?
You're live on camera, but try to act\nnatural, OK?\c
OK, that's how it is, huh.\nCan't do anything about that.
I'd like to take that footage and\nbroadcast it worldwide.
Oh, no. What we really want to see\nis you battling using two Pokémon!
Giggle!\nWill you have a battle with us?
We'll thoroughly check out your\nabilities as a Trainer!\c
Oh, too bad!\nI wanted to check out your Pokémon!
I lost but I'm totally thrilled!\nWe made a wonderful spectacle!
Do you want to hear me play my guitar?\nOr do we battle?
Your spirit's vibes...\nYou've got rock in your veins!\c
My guitar...\nIt lies broken and weeping...
For Trainers, Pokémon!\cFor my girl, sweet kisses!\cThat's the perfect world for this\nguitarist!
Thank you for coming to Grace's live\nshow in Snowpoint!\cI'm so happy you came to see me!\nI'll battle you as my thank-you!
I'll let you join my fan club if you can\nbeat me!\c
But my song!\nIt's nicer than that Crasher Wake's!
My dream is to be the top Idol!\cTo win everyone's heart, I'll sing my\nheart out in snowy Snowpoint!\c...To a crowd of none.\n...This is Grace. Thanks for listening...
We're doing a feature on tough Trainers\nin the Battle Zone.\cThat's where you come in.\nWe need you to battle us!
Reporter Kinsey's live interview!\c
You don't have to be shy.\nWe can obscure your face if we have to.
I go after interviews like my favorite\nPokémon move--I tackle them!\cOf course, I don't use Tackle in\nbattles, though.
Expert Trainer spotted!\nWill you let us battle with you?
Great! Great!\nYou guys are great!\c
Want to see how good you are before\nyou go off to the Battle Frontier?
The combination of you and your Pokémon\nwill tear up the Battle Tower!
Po-Po-Pokémon!\cI want to become more like a PIKACHU!\nWill you battle me?
Pi-Pikachu!\c
Pi-Pikachu!
I can make static electricity, but I'm\nnot very much like a Pokémon yet.\cDon't give up, me!\nBecome a Pokémon, me!
Pikachu!\cI want to become more like a PIKACHU!\nWill you battle me?
Pi-Pikachu!\c
Pi-Pikachu!
I need to find a way to get more into\nthe character of a Pokémon...\cMaybe I should get the Day Care to\nraise me?
As a clown, I like to show off Pokémon\nthat are a little out of the ordinary.\cWant to battle and see for yourself?
OK, how shall we do this?\nShall we do something fantastical?\c
Oh, how shall I say this...?\nIt makes me all lonely, I say...
Here's a piece of useless trivia.\nFear of clowns is also known as\rcoulrophobia!
Po-Po-Pokémon!\cI want to become more like a PIKACHU!\nWill you battle me?
Pi-Pikachu!\c
Pi-Pikachu!
But I just had my team pampered at the\nRibbon Syndicate!\cI have to get more into the character\nof a Pokémon...

Everyone that works in the coal mine\nkeeps their own Pokémon with them.\cYou may be challenged to battles!\nHahaha!
I found what I thought were some\nrocks, then they started moving!\cThey were Pokémon that looked just\nlike rocks!
Hello! How do you do!\nI'm a student of philosophy.\cIf I had to explain very simply, I study\nhow people came to be.\cThat could explain why I happen to be in\nSinnoh.\cIn Sinnoh, there is a myth on how the\nworld came into existence.\cInvestigating that myth may give me\ninsight on the emergence of people.\cI found something very interesting soon\nafter arrival.\cYou may have it, if you'd like.\c
Oh?\nYou have an overabundance of things!\rI'll wait for you with this.
Well, hello!\cAbout that very interesting thing\nI found...\cYou may have it, if you'd like.\c
I'm told that Plate was created at the\nsame time as Sinnoh.\cThat Plate I found bears this\ninscription.\c“The rightful bearer of a Plate\ndraws from the Plate it holds.”\cThe rightful bearer, I think, may\npoint to the shaper of this world.\cOh, by the way, I'm only interested in\nthe words and thoughts left behind.\cPhysical artifacts like that Plate\ndon't interest me once I've read them.\cI hope we meet again somewhere.\c

Isn't that just great.\nGetting owned by some kid.\cBut you can't do a thing if I lock\nmyself in with my Works Key!\cThat's right, the other Works Key's\nnot here!\cMy cohorts in the flower patch have\nthe only other one!\cHahaha! In that sense, I'm no longer\nthe loser!\c
Looker: Ah, yes.\nIt is you, yes.\cI have heard that the Team Galactic\nappeared at this power plant.\cI have, therefore, come running.\nSo, the Team Galactic. Where are they?\c...\cYou have run them off, you say?\nYou are a Trainer, but...?\cVery well!\nI shall go investigate inside!\c

What?! No way!\nYou have the key?\cLocking the door was meaningless!\nI am the loser in this after all!\cThis is no time for self-pity!\nI've got to alert the Commander!\c
My Pokémon can't battle anymore.\cThey're gonna take away my Pokémon\nfor messing this one up...\cHumph! Just you wait!\nOur Commander will smoosh you!
I'm one of Team Galactic's three\nCommanders.\c...No, wait.\nThat's one of four Commanders.\rMy name is Mars!\cWe've been trying to create a new\nworld that's better than this one...\cBut people have shown little\nunderstanding about what we do.\cYou don't understand either, do you?\nIt's a little saddening...\cSo, let's have a battle to decide\nwhat we should do next.\cIf I win, you leave.\cIf you win, we, Team Galactic, will\nleave!\c
Mars: Oops!\nI messed that one up!\cThat's all right, though.\nI quite enjoyed our battle.\c
Charon: My, my.\nLose to a child, will you?\cBut, no matter.\nWe've collected plenty of electricity.\cWith the power we obtained, we can\ndo something quite spectacular.\cIt seems quite obvious to me, Charon,\nthe genius even the boss recognizes.\cNow, Mars, we should be going.\c
Mars: Will you shut it!\cThe boss is the only person in the world\nwho's allowed to order me around!\cYou can keep quiet around me!\nYou only joined us recently.\rDon't think you're important!\c
I guess it's time to say good-bye\nand leave for the time being!\c
Team Galactic...\cThey were saying they had to gather\nPokémon and energy no matter what.\cIt was for creating a new universe,\nor so they claimed.\cNothing they said made any sort of\nsense to me.\cI can't tell you how grateful I am for\nyou saving me.\cI can finally see my little daughter\nagain!\c
Little girl: Papa!\cYuck! Papa, you're stinky!\nGo shower now, stinky!\c
Papa: Oh, sorry! Ahaha!\nThey had me working nonstop!\c
Little girl: Thank you, Trainer!\nYou made those bad people go away!\cI think the balloon Pokémon will\ncome visiting again!
Papa: Oh, yes, a balloon Pokémon\nappears in front of the windworks.\cIt's always a certain day of the week,\nbut I'm not sure which day.\cCould its appearance have something\nto do with this windworks using\rwind-generated energy?
The Valley Windworks uses turbines\nto capture energy from winds driven\rfrom the mountains in this canyon.\cWe produce energy from the power of\nnature itself. It's quite wonderful.
If the balloon Pokémon came,\nthe wind would blow it away!

[VAR 0103(0000,0000)]: Hey, [VAR 0103(0001,0000)]!\nThis is it! It's your show now!\c
Cyrus: ...\n...\cEverything is ready for the creation\nof a new world.\cNow, all will end.\nAnd everything will begin.\cWith this, the Red Chain made from the\ncrystals of the three lake Pokémon...\cAnd this, the Red Chain I replicated\nwith technological means...\cWith these Red Chains I will pry open\nthe portal to another dimension.\cI command that you unleash your power\nfor me...\c
DIALGA, the mythical Pokémon, and\nthe master of time!\c
                 
...And the other.\cPALKIA, the mythical Pokémon, and\nthe master of space and dimensions!\c
              
Cyrus: I've waited so long for this\nmoment, DIALGA and PALKIA.\cShaping this world is a double spiral\nof time and space.\cYes, the very things that you have the\nability to control!\cYou will do my bidding!\nI will have your abilities as mine!\cWith the power I wield, I will create\nan entirely new world!\c
The incomplete and ugly world we have\nnow can disappear.\cI am resetting everything to zero.\nNothing can remain.\cIt is all for making the ultimate world.\nA world of complete perfection.\cNothing so vague and incomplete as\nspirit can remain.\c
Cyrus: ...I should have expected as\nmuch.\cUXIE, “The Being of Knowledge.”\cAZELF, “The Being of Willpower.”\cAnd MESPRIT, “The Being of Emotion”...\c
The Pokémon have come to protect\nSinnoh? Pathetic and worthless.\cIt takes the three of them, the three\nlake Pokémon that symbolize spirit,\rto balance either the Pokémon of time\ror space.\cBut they can't maintain balance against\nthe two.\cNot when both DIALGA and PALKIA are\nhere.\cTheir coming here is in vain.\nSo much meaningless drama.\c
Now, [VAR 0103(0000,0000)].\cYou've constantly interfered with my\nplans, but you will be forgiven.\cAfter all, there will remain no spirit\nfor all time when I am done.\cAll spirit will disappear.\nIt will be ripped away...\cFrom you!\nFrom your Pokémon!\rFrom those precious to you...!\cIt is time!\nMy dream will be my reality!\c
What is this pressure I feel...?\nSomething...is enraged?\c
Cyrus: Interesting.\cSo, there is a Pokémon that can only\nappear as a shadow.\c
Regardless, the effort is rash and\nfoolish.\cI have harnessed the powers of DIALGA\nand PALKIA...\c
I, Cyrus, won't have any more\ninterferererererere...!

Jupiter: ...Says you.\nAn “ordinary girl” you're not.\cWhat should I do now?\nIs leaving on a journey the right idea?\c
Charon: Sigh...\nSo impressionable and impetuous.\cWhat do they see in Cyrus?\nImmature, overthinking buffoon.\cHe goes through the trouble of\nassembling Team Galactic for what?\cUltimately, he destroys his own\ncreation for his ludicrous vision.\cIt's no thanks to him that I have to\nstruggle with the pieces.\c
...But that's fine.\nThe young can live with their dreams.\cI prefer to remain firmly in reality.\nAnd for that, money is paramount.\cYou there, child.\nI'm not dealing with you.\cAfter all, the other Galactic members\nwho did all suffered consequences.\cWe'll be off to collect the Magma Stone.\nIt's all for the money!\c

Cyrus: I see.\nYou are indeed strong.\cAnd the basis of your power is your\ncompassion toward Pokémon.\c...How wasteful...\nSuch emotions are but mere illusions.\cAnd, like all illusions, they fade over\ntime until death banishes them forever.\cThat is why I have abandoned all\nemotions as useless sentimentality.\c...But that doesn't matter.

The mythical Pokémon...\cAccording to myths, the Pokémon\ncreated Sinnoh with its power.\cHowever, capturing the Pokémon with\na Poké Ball prevents it from using\rits full power...\cBut with the Red Chain, the Pokémon\ncan be shackled, and its power can\rbe used without restraint...\cThe PC entry ends there...\c
The Red Chain...\cThe Pokémon of the three lakes and\nMt. Coronet are somehow connected.\cCapturing the Pokémon of the lakes\nwill free the Pokémon of Mt. Coronet.\cFrom the Pokémon of the lakes,\ncrystals can be extracted to create\ra Red Chain.\cUsing that Red Chain, the mythical\nPokémon can be summoned and shackled\rto do as we command...\cThe PC entry ends there...\c

OK, to get into Master Cyrus's\nspeech... Uh, where was it now?\cAt the Galactic Veilstone Building,\nthat much I'm sure about.\cGo in through the door beside the\nreception counter, I think it was?\cUh? What'd I do with that key anyway?\nWhere's it gone?
Team Galactic will set free all Pokémon,\nall of nature!\cUwahahaha!\nTeam Galactic will then own it all!

You... You came all the way here\njust to save some Pokémon?\c...Though it's nothing new, I can't\nsay I understand our boss...\cWhy would he let a kid like you\ncome and go freely...?\cWe, Team Galactic, take all that we\nneed, and eliminate what we do not.\cBut anyway. You've taken the trouble\nto come. Let me welcome you!\cConsider it payback for your insulting\nme at the lake.\c
...Gah!\nWhat makes you so tough?\cFine... Do whatever you want with\nthose three Pokémon.\cPress the button on that machine\nto set them free.\c
Press the button and set them free.\nIsn't that why you came?
Our boss crafted a Red Chain from\ncrystals he took from the three\rPokémon.\cThat Red Chain is what he needed to\nshackle something on Mt. Coronet.\cIt's also apparently needed for\ncreating something.\cBut that's all I know. Who knows\nwhat he's planning to do up there.\c
Press the button and set them free.\nIsn't that why you came?\c
Charon: Fuhyahya!\cThose Pokémon of the lakes, where do\nyou suppose they would go?\c
Saturn: What are you trying to say?\c
Charon: Nothing.\nPay it no heed.\cA new world isn't overly interesting.\nWhat of it?\cIf Cyrus is right, then Team Galactic\nwill rule that new world.\cThat's when it will be interesting.\nA chance to enjoy its sweets.\cI surely hope that our visionary Cyrus\nrealizes his dream.\cI look forward to whatever our beloved\nleader has planned atop Mt. Coronet.\c
Saturn: Gramps.\cOur boss can do without your kind of\nmoral support.
Charon: Humph. Saturn and even Cyrus\nfall to a mere child...\cTeam Galactic's state of affairs is\nworrying...\cThat plan of Cyrus's atop Mt. Coronet,\ntoo... Who knows if it will work.\c...Hmm. Perhaps another option needs\nto be considered.\cOne befitting the genius of Charon!
Press the button and set\nthe Pokémon free?
[VAR 0103(0000,0000)] pressed the button and\nset the Pokémon free.\c
The button has been pressed already.\nYou have to leave.
UXIE is sealed inside! It appears to\nbe suffering, with eyes squeezed shut.
MESPRIT is sealed inside! It seems to\nbe suffering, with its tail twitching.
AZELF is sealed inside! It appears to\nbe suffering, with wracking shudders.

Looker: Psst! Here.\nOver here.\cThis gathering of the Team Galactic...\nWhat is the meaning of it?\c
Cyrus: Fellow members of Team Galactic!\nHear me!\cMy name, as I appear to you today,\nis Cyrus.\cThis world of ours is a crude one.\nIn a word, it is incomplete.\cIt has been, and always will be, a\nstruggle to survive in this world.\cWe humans and Pokémon are likewise\nincomplete.\cBecause we are all so lacking, we fight,\nwe maim... It is ugly.\cI hate the incompleteness.\cThat we are all incomplete, I hate it\nwith my entire body and being.\cThe world should be complete.\nThe world must change.\c
Then, who will change it?\cMe, Cyrus. And Team Galactic.\nYes, all of you.\cTogether we pored over myths and\nexposed their secrets.\cTogether we captured legendary\nPokémon.\cAnd now, Team Galactic has obtained\nthe energy to change the world!\cThe power of dreams is within our\ngrasp!\c
Understand it, fellow members!\cMy long-held dreamworld is on the\nverge of becoming reality.\cAll those headed to Mt. Coronet, and\nthose who remain here...\cThough our missions may differ, our\nhearts beat as one.\cLet there be glory for Team Galactic!\c
Grunts: WROOOAR!!\c
Grunt: Master Cyrus is the greatest!\c
Looker: ...Whew.\cSo, that was Cyrus, the boss of the\nTeam Galactic.\cQuite the performance, no?\nMesmerizing for one only 27 years old.\c...But to make a world for Team Galactic\nand none other?\cIt is preposterous. So much so that it\nmakes my head spin.\cA new world? What is that?\nAnd what is this incomplete world?\cVery well. To investigate such matters\nis the job of the International Police.\cOf which I am a member in good stead.\nAnd it is my job, therefore.\cWe shall part ways here.\nTake extra care, my friend!\c

I accomplished my\nmission without a problem!\c
Team! We're pulling out!\nThe boss is waiting at the HQ!\c
The Pokémon of the three lakes are\nconnected somehow.\cThanks to Saturn's grandstanding at\nLake Valor, a cavern appeared here.\cIt was the cavern where the Pokémon\nMESPRIT slept.\cMESPRIT appeared, too, probably to\ngo help its friends.\cThat worked out well for us.\nIt was super easy to catch.\cSo, now we've got them all:\nMESPRIT, “The Being of Emotion.”\rAZELF, “The Being of Willpower.”\rUXIE, “The Being of Intelligence.”\cNow that we have them all...\cYou can look forward to what plans\nTeam Galactic has for them!\c
Rowan: I see...\nThis also occurred at Lake Valor...\cAnother legendary Pokémon was taken\naway by Team Galactic...\cBoth of you went up against\nfull-fledged criminals...\cThe fact that you're unharmed is\nreason enough to celebrate.\c...But what about [VAR 0103(0000,0000)]?\cWhat is happening at Lake Acuity?\nIs [VAR 0103(0000,0000)] safe?
Rowan: [VAR 0103(0000,0000)], I need you to\ngo to Lake Acuity right away.\cI'm worried about [VAR 0103(0001,0000)].
Dawn: [VAR 0103(0000,0000)], what is Team\nGalactic up to?\cAre the abducted Pokémon of the\nlakes going to be OK?
Lucas: [VAR 0103(0000,0000)], what's Team\nGalactic up to?\cThey'd better not harm the Pokémon\nthey took from the lakes...

[VAR 0103(0000,0000)], why don't you chase\nafter MESPRIT?\cTo me, it seemed as if it wanted to\nplay with you.\cIf you were to use the Pokétch app\nMarking Map, you'd be able to\rtrack the movements of Pokémon.\c
What?\nYou don't have the Marking Map?\c...You should occasionally pay visits\nto the Pokétch Company, you know.\c
Go on, [VAR 0103(0000,0000)].\cI'm sure that you will keep meeting\ncountless Pokémon and people.\cThose encounters will keep thrilling\nyou in their own special ways.\cI hope you'll enjoy that experience!\nTake care, [VAR 0103(0000,0000)].\c

Battle Tower... Its height is a symbol\nof its challenge to Trainers.
All the places in the Battle Frontier\nlet you team up with a friend!
I don't think it's good enough for an\nIdol to just be cute, sing, and dance.\cI should learn more about Pokémon so\nI can attract the Poké maniacs.
I get to battle with the world's best\nin do-or-die situations here.
The most important person in the Battle\nCastle is a lady.\cLady, like a princess, I mean.
What makes me the most happy being\na Trainer?\cThe fact that Pokémon will always be\nwith me!
Behind every Pokémon, there is a\nstory. Isn't that right, dear?
Like a Pokémon and Trainer, we have\nbeen together for a long time.\cEventually, we will be parted...\cUntil then, I will cherish the time we\nhave, dearest.
People expect so much from a maid.\nCooking, cleaning, and laundry...\cNot to mention being good at training\nPokémon!
To be strong is to be weak.\nTo be weak is to be strong.\cI was told that a long time ago.\nNot that I have any clue what it means.
There are those who love battling from\ndeep in the cockles of their hearts.\cThe people that gather here?\nThat would be them.
I wonder how many years it's been since\nI first met a Pokémon?\cHow much time has passed for you and\nyour Pokémon?
Trainers can command Pokémon to\nuse moves in battle with confidence.\cThey can do that because Trainers\nbelieve in their Pokémon.\cIn turn, Pokémon repay that trust\nby using moves the best they can.\cThis may seem obvious, but it's actually\nincredibly amazing!
I treat every battle as if it were my\nlast.\cGoing into battle willing to accept\na loss? Unforgivable!\cBut losing is also inevitable.\nA good Trainer learns from it.
The Pokémon's type!\cThe moves to be learned!\cThe items to be held!\cIf your aim is to be no. 1 here,\nyou can't overlook a single detail.
You know, when I lose, the first thing\nI do is look for who to blame.\cLike, the opponent cheated, or I was\nunlucky, or it's my Pokémon's fault...\cBut I know I shouldn't do that.\nI won't get better unless I change.
There are five facilities in the Battle\nFrontier.\cAt every one, you can win your way\nthrough to challenge the boss.\cI think they're called Brains, and\nthey're out-of-this-world tough!
I know it's no revelation now, but...\nThe way of Pokémon is deep.
At the Battle Factory, you have to\nkeep winning with rental Pokémon.\cIt's a real test of your knowledge.\nIt's perfect for a student like me!
The Battle Hall is where I want to be.\cEven the MAGIKARP I caught fishing\nhas a shot at no. 1!
My inflatable tube lets me ride out\nthe ebbs and flows of life.
Welcome to the Exchange Service\nCorner!\cWould you like to trade in your BP for\nsome prizes?
                         
Welcome to the Exchange Service\nCorner!\cWould you like to trade in your BP for\nsome prizes?

Welcome to the Battle Frontier!\cThis is your first visit?\nRight this way, please!\c
Oh! You have a Vs. Recorder!\nHow nice!\cWe upgrade Vs. Recorders for first-time\nvisitors for Battle Frontier use.\cI'll borrow yours for a moment.\cLet's see... Slide open this part here,\nand ticka-tacka-kachunk there!\cAll done!\nHere you go.\c
[VAR 0103(0000,0000)]'s Vs. Recorder was\nupgraded.
Our other staff will be pleased to\nexplain how the individual facilities\rof the Battle Frontier operate.\cI can go over general topics.\nDo you have any questions?
Which topic should I explain?
The Battle Frontier has five facilities\ndedicated to battling.\cAt the Battle Tower, the objective is\nto beat seven Trainers in a row.\cAt the Battle Hall, you may keep battle\nrecords of individual Pokémon.\cAt the Battle Factory, you must win\nconsecutive battles with rentals.\cThe Battle Castle forces Trainers to\nmanage Castle Points to advance.\cAnd finally, the Battle Arcade is where\nrandom luck triggers events.\c
The battles at the five Battle Frontier\nfacilities are held under special rules.\cFirst and foremost, no Exp. Points\ncan be earned.\cConsequently, the Pokémon battling\nhere will not level up.\cIf the Level 50 rule is chosen,\nPokémon of higher levels will be\rtemporarily reduced to Lv. 50.\cPokémon under Lv. 50 will be entered\nwithout an upward level adjustment.\c
Battle Points are usually referred to\nas BP.\cBP are points that are used only in\nthe Battle Frontier.\cBP are awarded for meeting certain\nperformance goals at the various\rBattle Frontier facilities.\cBP can be exchanged for prizes at\nthe Exchange Service Corner.\c
The Exchange Service Corner is the\ntent straight ahead past here.\cThere, you may exchange your BP for\na wide variety of prizes.\cPlease do visit it!\c
The Performance Monitor shows Trainer\ndata, such as the previous record and\rthe best record to date.\cYou will find one near the reception\ncounter in each facility.\c
We hope you enjoy your visit!

We hope you enjoy your visit!
Welcome to the Battle Frontier!\cShould I explain how the Battle Arcade\nworks?
The Battle Arcade is at the lower-right\ncorner of the Battle Frontier.\cHere, a game board is activated\nbefore every match.\cDepending on what comes up on the\ngame board, an event takes place.\cSome events will be good to the\nchallenger, while others won't be.\cThe challenger may even avoid having\nto battle at all.\cThe objective is to keep a winning\nstreak alive as long as possible.\c
We hope you enjoy your visit!
The Battle Frontier is up ahead!\cWhat kinds of Trainers will I see?\nWhat battles will I experience?\cIt's a whole new adventure for me!
The five facilities of the Battle\nFrontier are...\cTower.\cHall.\cCastle.\cFactory.\cAnd Arcade.\cHow do you make an acronym out of\nthat? THCFA?\cRearrange those letters, maybe?\nFATCH! CHAFT!\c...Nope! Nothing works!\nDidn't anyone think of this?!
The Vs. Recorder is sure nifty!\cTouching the screen shows you how\nmuch BP you have.
My dream is to battle Palmer of the\nBattle Tower.\cI want to record it for posterity on\nmy Vs. Recorder.\cBut I'm not good enough to battle my\nway to see Palmer... I'm heartbroken!

They're very helpful here.\cThe staff tell you about the next\nTrainer you'll face.
Want to hear my trick to choosing\nPokémon?\cGet your opponent's lineup and choose\naccordingly. That's rock-solid basic!
Memorize what moves the opponent's\nPokémon used.\cThat way, you'll know what to expect\nwhen you're choosing one for trade.
I'll teach you my style.\nMy way of doing things.\cBasically, I choose Pokémon that I've\nnever raised before.\cDoing that, I get more knowledgeable.\nBetter Pokémon intelligence.\cThat knowledge is power.\nIt makes me a better Trainer.
Howdy-do!\nDo you raise Pokémon?\cYou sure do.\nOf course you do.\cBut do you raise every kind of Pokémon?\nNo, no, no. Not likely you do.\cThis is a wonderful place.\nYou can challenge with nothing.\cOf course, all you can challenge with\nare rental Pokémon.\cRemember this, my favorite place to be.\nIts name: the Battle Factory!
Oh, my goodness, what am I to do?\nI didn't expect this to happen!\cThe Pokémon I battled with became my\nfavorites.\cBut I already have six favorites!
There were some Pokémon I hated\nbecause they were so tough to battle.\cBut when I had them on my side, they\nwon me over with their power.

Please come see me when you are ready.\c
The Battle Hall Multi Battle challenge\nrequires both partners to enter the\rsame kind of Pokémon.\cPlease confer with your friend and\nchoose the same kind of Pokémon.\c
       
When it comes to food, this Hiker\nchows down on the favorites first.\cBut here, I start with types that my\nPokémon doesn't like. Why?\cBecause the opposition goes up in level\nas you progress.
That opulent stage!\nEvery Pokémon can get up there.\cYes! You can try for a record with\nyour one favorite Pokémon.\cEven a Pokémon that's not considered a\ngood battler can make a challenge.
Pachipachi...\cMy PACHIRISU is a cutie, but he's even\nbattled the Brain here.\cThe Brain will take your Pokémon on at\nthe same level, to be fair.
PACHIRISU: Pachipachi pacchipachii!
You should try the Battle Hall with\ndifferent kinds of Pokémon, too.\cDoing that, you'll be building your\noverall record as well.
There's a key point to keep in mind\nhere.\cIf it's the same kind of Pokémon, you\ncan enter different ones.\cThat means you can have different ones\nknowing different types of moves.\cThat could make it easier to win against\ncertain types.
You know how CROAGUNK has two types:\nPoison and Fighting?\cThat means it can appear as a Poison\ntype and as a Fighting type.
Ohoho! Ohohohoho!\nI'm the mysterious maid!\cAnd what is mysterious about me is the\nmysterious part!\cAnd now, a piece of advice.\cAt the Battle Hall, the opposing\nPokémon are matched in level to yours.\cThat way, you can make challenges\nwithout worrying about levels.
There's this game that I'm totally into\nright now.\cMy friend and I started challenges\nwith identical conditions.\cWe're competing over who can stretch\ntheir win streak the longest. It's fun!
I keep track of the total number of\nwins from your longest Single Battle\rwin streaks at the Battle Hall.\cTo explain, I add only the longest win\nstreaks of each kind of Pokémon.
When your total win-streak record hits\ncertain figures, you will earn BP as\rrewards.\c[VAR 0103(0000,0000)], your total win-streak\nrecord is presently [VAR 0137(0001,0000)].\c
Your total win-streak record has\nreached [VAR 0137(0002,0000)].\rHere is your BP reward.\c
When your total win-streak record\nreaches [VAR 0137(0003,0000)], you will earn BP.
[VAR 0103(0000,0000)] received [VAR 0135(0004,0000)] BP!
[VAR 0103(0000,0000)], your total win-streak\nrecord stands at [VAR 0137(0001,0000)].\c
[VAR 0103(0000,0000)], your total win-streak\nrecord stands at [VAR 0137(0001,0000)].\c...My goodness!\nThat's a fantastic record!
Winston: The Battle Hall's been kind of\nboring lately.\cThere haven't been any dazzling\nchallengers who can electrify crowds.\cThe kind of challenger who can beat the\nBrain... Aren't there any around?
Winston: Let me take a wild guess.\nAre you getting into the Battle Hall?\rIt's addictively fun, huh?\cThe more you win, the more kinds of\nPokémon you get to see, too.
Winston: ...\n...Oh, sorry for staring!\cI saw you on stage the last time.\nYou've got some star quality.\cI think I'm going to keep an eye on you.\nThere's real charisma there.
Winston: I check you out every time\nyou get up on stage.\cYou're fun to watch, let me tell you.\cNow I'm always looking forward to\nseeing the combo of you and your\rPokémon on stage.
Winston: Hey, there!\nWhat are you going to do this time?\cWhich Pokémon are you going for a\nrecord with next?\cWhen I get to thinking about that,\nI get too wound up to sleep at night.\cThat's why I've been sleeping in lately!
Winston: Awesome!\nSeriously awesome!\rYou're beyond awesome, even!\cThe love you show so many Pokémon...\nIt's no easy feat, I can tell ya!
Winston: I've never seen Pokémon\nbattle as enjoyably as yours do.\cYou're the first of a kind for me as\nTrainers go.\cYou know, I brag about you to everyone\nwho's willing to listen.\cI was saying that you're going to be a\nstar before you even got a record!
Winston: Go, [VAR 0103(0000,0000)], go!\nGo, [VAR 0103(0000,0000)], go!\cI'm thinking up some dance steps and\ncheers I can do to support you.\cIf you want to see them, you'll need to\nkeep working on your records!
Winston: You're phenomenal.\nAll the battles you waged on stage...\rAll those moments of glory...\cYour star burns so bright and huge!\nI can barely open my eyes around you!
Winston: The love for Pokémon you\nexhibited at the Battle Hall is as\rinfinitely deep as it is wide...\cYou can count on me, Winston, to be\nyour lifelong fan.\cJust as you love Pokémon, I love you\nas the Pokémon superstar!
Serena: It's about the Battle Hall...\nIt hasn't excited me lately.\cThere's been no gorgeous sort of\nchallenger who can dazzle me.\cThe kind of challenger who can make me\na fan... Aren't there any around?
Serena: Um... Excuse me?\cIf you don't mind me asking, are you\ngetting into the Battle Hall?\cIt's fun in an engrossing way, isn't it?\nDid you know?\cThe more you win, the more kinds of\nPokémon appear.
Serena: Um... Excuse me?\cI watched you when you were on stage.\nIt made me feel all tingly seeing you.\cUm... You won't mind if I cheer for you\nfrom now on, will you? Please, may I?
Serena: Um... Excuse me?\cI cheer for you the best I can.\cI can't get up on stage with you, but\nI want to lend my support to your\rPokémon and you for trying so hard.
Serena: Um... Excuse me?\cCan you tell me what kind of Pokémon\nyou're going for a record with next?\cWhen I start thinking about that, I get\nsort of all choked up.\cI have trouble sleeping at night when\nI get that way.
Serena: Um... Excuse me?\cFantastic! It's fantastic!\nYou're fabulously fantastic!\cThe love you show so many Pokémon...\nIt must take extraordinary effort.
Serena: I've never seen Pokémon\nbattle as enjoyably as yours do.\cYou're the first Trainer ever who's\ndone that.\cI... I brag about you to all my friends.\nI hope you don't mind.\cI tell them I wish I could be as\nwonderful a Trainer as you!
Serena: Hurray, hurray, [VAR 0103(0000,0000)]!\nGo, Pokémon, go!\c...Oh! Um... Excuse me.\cI was working on cheers and a dance\nroutine for you.\cB-but, I'm sorry for being so silly and\ngiddy and...
Serena: You're so inspiring to me.\cAll the glory you earned while battling\nso often on that shining stage...\cJust seeing you makes me feel all\nhappy inside. ♪
Serena: Your Pokémon love that you've\nshown at the Battle Hall is as infinitely\rdeep as it is wide...\cIt's amazing, but you love every kind of\nPokémon there is.\cI love you for being so amazing and\ndedicated!
Dawn: Hi, [VAR 0103(0000,0000)].\nDo you know what I've been doing?\cI go looking for the Pokémon that take\nthe stage with you.\cI catch them, too!\nMy Pokédex is filling up from it.\cI guess I can thank you for that,\n[VAR 0103(0000,0000)]. So, thank you!
Lucas: These stage battles are lots\nof fun just to watch!\cYou get to see so many different kinds\nof Pokémon. It's cool.
Mom: [VAR 0103(0000,0000)]!\cWhen I come here, I cheer for everyone\non stage. I can't help myself.\cBut when I see you win, it does feel\ndifferent.\cIt's not just about feeling happy.\nIt evokes something in me.
Oak: You keep amazing me over and over.\nWhat a Trainer you turned out to be!\cIt's not enough that you caught\nPokémon in numbers beyond belief.\cThat alone is fantastic enough, but\nyou've battled with them as well.\cYou're what all Trainers should aspire\nto be!
Jasmine: I love showy events like\nBattle Hall challenges and Contests.\cThey show me aspects of Pokémon that\nI didn't know about.

One Trainer should select\n“BECOME LEADER.”\cThe other Trainer must select\n“JOIN GROUP.”

You must save the game before I\nshow you in. Please wait.
If your Pokémon win without taking\ndamage, you earn more CP.
You can earn more CP by facing higher-\nlevel opponents.\cIt's meaningless if you don't win, of\ncourse.
Before every battle, you should check\nthe opponent's lineup.\cDon't be cheap with your CP.\nIt's like that old saying goes about\rknowing your enemy.\c“If you know yourself but not your\nenemy, for every victory gained\ryou will also suffer a defeat.”\cIn other words, it all goes up in smoke\nif you lose!
Mr. Darach...\nOh, how I pine for thee...
At first, you can only use CP for\nrestoring HP.\cYou can spend CP to rank up, though.\nDoing that, you can even restore PP.
I have a matter of grave importance\nto share with you.\cI can't stress just how important\nthis is for me to say.\cIf you lose, your entire stock of CP\nis cleaned out to zero! How tragic!
Like every man's dream, I want to\nlive in a castle!

Blaming the game board for losing\nis pitiful. It's poor form.\cThe game board will show better choices\nthe greater the wins you achieve.

Cyrus: ...The shadowy Pokémon isn't\nhere.\cIt abandoned me here, then disappeared\nsomewhere farther down...\cWas it content merely to interfere\nwith my plan...?\cIncidentally, do you understand the\nconcept of genes?
...If it's true, you've impressed me.\c
...No, of course, you wouldn't.\c
Genes can be considered the blueprints\nof all life-forms.\cThat includes humans and Pokémon alike.\cGenes are contained in a DNA strand.\cA DNA strand consists of two chains\nof opposing characteristics in a spiral.\cIf one of the chains were to be broken,\nthe other could replicate it.\cOne or the other cannot exist without\nits opposite.\cDo you understand where I am going\nwith this?\cThis is a bizarre world.\nTime doesn't flow.\rSpace isn't stable.\cOnly that shadowy Pokémon lives\nhere.\cThis world is the opposite of our \nworld--our world I wish to change.\cIt is like the two chains composing a\nstrand of DNA.\cThe two worlds must be balancing each\nother to remain in existence.\cWithout the one, the other cannot\nexist.\cThe shadowy Pokémon must play a role in\nkeeping the worlds in balance.\cThat is why it must have interfered\nand brought me here.\c
The shadowy Pokémon must have made\nthis bizarre world.\cThat's why trying to change our world\ndisturbed it and made it reveal itself.\cBut that is all irrelevant.\cWhat matters is defeating that Pokémon\nand making this world disappear.\cI won't allow it to interfere with me\nagain.\cWith it gone, neither world will be able\nto revert to its original state...\c

Cyrus: Why should I run and hide from\nthe world and have to wait quietly?\cMy aim is to rid our world of the vague\nand incomplete thing we call spirit.\cBy freeing ourselves of that, our\nworld can be made complete.\cThat is my justice!\nNo one can interfere!
Cyrus: I won't lose!\cNot to that shadowy Pokémon!\nNot in any worthless world!\c
Cyrus: ...Don't think that you can\ndefeat or capture that Pokémon.\cThis bizarre world is none other than\nthat Pokémon itself!\cCapturing it or defeating it will make\nthis world disappear!\cVery well!\nDo what you will!\cRather than repairing the world, you're\ngoing to destroy it for me!\cDo it.\nYou inherit my legacy.\c
Cynthia: Don't believe his lies.\cIt's not possible that a Pokémon can\nmake the world disappear.\cThe world awaited your birth.\nNot only yours, either.\cThe Pokémon with you.\nThe people close to you.\cAll the Pokémon and people were born\nbecause they have a part in the world.\cI'm convinced of that.\cGIRATINA won't go out of existence.\nThis Distortion World won't disappear.\rOur world won't disappear, either.\cLet's go meet GIRATINA.\c...Oops. I should do something about\nyour hardworking Pokémon first.\c
Cynthia fully healed [VAR 0103(0000,0000)]'s\nPokémon.\c
Cynthia: Now let's go meet GIRATINA!\c
Cynthia: GIRATINA is enraged because\nthe two worlds are endangered.\cIt has merged the Distortion World and\nour world at the Spear Pillar.\cThat's why both worlds are becoming\ndistorted.\cBut there's nothing to fear.\cYou can defeat GIRATINA and show the\ntight bond you share with your Pokémon.\cOr you can demonstrate how much you\nwant it to join you.\cIf you succeed in doing either,\nGIRATINA will understand.\cThe distortion of the two worlds will\nstop!
Cynthia: I know that the bond you\nshare with your Pokémon is strong!

GIRATINA is quietly eyeing\n[VAR 0103(0000,0000)]...
Giygogagohgwooh!\c
Cynthia: GIRATINA seems to have\nunderstood us!\c
Cyrus: That Pokémon...\cThat shadowy Pokémon was defeated?!\c
Cyrus: That Pokémon...\cThat shadowy Pokémon was captured?!\c
Cyrus: That shadowy Pokémon...\cYou quelled its rage by refusing to\nbattle it?!\c
Your doing so means this irrational\nworld will remain in existence!\cDoes that make it impossible for me to\ncreate a new world?\cEven if I made new Red Chains, the new\nworld can't be made!\cWhy?! What compels you to protect\nthe two worlds?\cIs spirit, a vague and incomplete\nthing, so important to you?!\c
Cynthia: ...The places we are born.\cThe time we spend living...\cThe languages we speak...\cWe are all different.\nBut the presence of Pokémon unites us.\cWe share our lives with our Pokémon,\nand our happiness grows as we all\rbecome greater than we were alone.\cThat is why we can battle and trade\nwith anyone we choose...\c
[VAR FF01(00C8)]Silence![VAR FF01(0064)]\c
Cyrus: Enough of your blathering!\cThat's how you justify spirit as\nsomething worthwhile?!\cThat is merely humans hoping,\ndeluding themselves that they are\rhappy and safe!\cThe emotions roiling inside me...\nRage, hatred, frustration...\cThese ugly emotions arise because of\nmy own incomplete spirit!\c...Enough.\nWe will never see eye to eye.\cThis, I promise you.\nI will break the secrets of the world.\cWith that knowledge, I will create my\ncomplete and perfect world.\cOne day, you will awaken to a world of\nmy creation.\cA world without spirit.\c
Cynthia: ...\n...\cSince there is sadness, we can\nfeel joy.\cWhen there is anger, compassion\nis born...\c
Let's go back home.\cThe portal where GIRATINA was should\nlead back to our world.\cGIRATINA was written in legend as\nbeing on the other side of our world.\cIt stands to reason that it has a link\nto the other side.
There is a portal where GIRATINA was.\nWill you leap into the portal?
[VAR 0103(0000,0000)] leapt into the portal.\c

It's a statue of a Pokémon.\nIt seems to exude power...\cFrom somewhere, something spoke out.\c“With our Master, upon every lighted\ntile you must tread.”

Thorton: Hmm...\nI got handed another loss.\cIt's not making me happy at all, this.\nIn fact, I'm stewing here.\cI thought I learned a lot about\nPokémon since I lost to you.\cBut that's all right.\nSome things you learn from winning.\rBut some things you learn by losing.\cI hope you'll keep renting our Pokémon\nand give me a chance to redeem myself!\c

Rowan: Ah, [VAR 0103(0000,0000)]!\cYou've come to show me the progress\nyou've made on your Pokédex?
Hmm...\cYou've spotted [VAR 0134(0000,0000)] Pokémon in\nSinnoh...\c
What's wrong?\cYou're not suggesting you've seen so\nfew that you're afraid to show me?
                                             
I see!\cYou've met all the Pokémon there\nare in Sinnoh!\c[VAR 0103(0000,0000)], I need to see you\nat my lab. I'll be waiting!
I see!\cYou've met all the Pokémon there\nare in Sinnoh!
Look harder for wild Pokémon.\cDon't be afraid of going into tall\ngrass.
Your pace is picking up.\nThings can only get better!
Be persistent when you're searching\nfor Pokémon that appear only in\rcertain places.
Are you using fishing rods?\cPokémon that live underwater need to\nbe caught by fishing.
Remember, it's important to make the\nPokémon you've caught evolve.
Pokémon don't just hide in tall grass.\cYou can find many others in caves and\nseas.
The Trainers that challenge you to\nbattle have Pokémon, obviously.\cThey may have rare ones with them,\nand that can add to your Pokédex.
Some Pokémon appear only in the\nmorning and some only at night.\cI know it's a challenge, but I urge you\nto keep searching.
Fantastic! Your effort is helping us\nunderstand what evolving involves.\cYour Pokédex doesn't have long to go\nnow.
I'm simply astounded by the huge\nvariety of Pokémon in Sinnoh.\cThis will help my studies immensely!\nSincerely, thank you!
Your Pokédex is well on the way to\nbeing filled up.\cThis Pokédex can be considered a\njournal of your adventure.
You're not far from seeing every\nPokémon there is to see in Sinnoh!
Oak: Ah, [VAR 0103(0000,0000)]!\cYou've come to show me how\nyour Pokédex is coming along?
Oak: Ah, [VAR 0103(0000,0000)]!\cYou've come to show me how\nyour Pokédex is coming along?
Hmhm...\nYou've caught [VAR 0134(0000,0000)] so far...\c
I see...\cCome see me if you'd like me to have\na look at your Pokédex.
They say there are at least 400\nspecies of Pokémon nationwide.\cIf you're planning to catch them all,\nyou'd better be a committed Trainer.
Hm! Little by little, you're filling\nthe Pokédex with complete\rdata on Pokémon you've gotten.\cKeep up the good work!
Here's a tip on catching Pokémon\nin the wild.\cMinimize their HP before you throw\nyour Poké Ball to catch them.
Remember: If you can't catch them,\nyou can always trade for them.\cAs soon as you trade, the Pokémon's\ndata is added to the Pokédex.\cThat's why you should seek out as many\ntrades as possible.
Have you visited the Great Marsh?\cSome Pokémon only appear in places\nsuch as that.
As you know, there are Pokémon\nthat eventually evolve.\cThat's an important thing to consider\nwhen you're filling your Pokédex.
You've proven yourself capable.\nThere's nothing to worry about.\cKeep catching Pokémon the way you've\nbeen doing so far.
Are you aware that there is more than\none style of evolution?\cThere are some Pokémon that evolve by\nbecoming friends with the Trainer.
Apparently, there are some Pokémon\nthat appear in swarms on occasion.\cDon't miss out on these massive\noutbreaks of Pokémon!
Amazing! You've already gotten over\n300 Pokémon!\cThat's already a major achievement,\nbut I know you're capable of more!
Some wild Pokémon only appear during\ncertain times of the day.\cYou'll need to look for Pokémon\naround the clock.
I've been getting reports of\ndifferent Pokémon sightings.\cBy different, I mean Pokémon that\naren't native to the Sinnoh region.\cYou should perhaps go back to\nareas you've already scoured.\cYou may end up seeing Pokémon\nthat weren't there before.
[VAR 0103(0000,0000)], have you visited\nthe Pal Park recently?\cThere still may be Pokémon that are\nrarely seen in Sinnoh.
[VAR 0103(0000,0000)], have you visited\nthe Pal Park recently?\cThere still may be Pokémon that are\nrarely seen in Sinnoh.
Hm! Your Pokédex is getting closer\nto completion.\cHave you ever considered a career\nas a Pokémon professor?
Hmm... You've caught quite the\nimpressive collection of Pokémon.\cYou've obviously had to employ many\nmeans to seek them all out.\cIf you have a Poké Radar, keep an eye\nout for rustling tall grass.
I can only marvel at the diversity\nof Pokémon.\cI'm still very much in awe of\nthem.
Good, good, you're getting close to\ncompleting the Pokédex.\cI'm looking forward to seeing its\ncompletion.\cWhen that happens, your views about\nPokémon will likely have changed!
Hmm... You are so very close to\ncompleting your Pokédex.\cThink about what's missing.\nRecall what you've overlooked.\cYou're so close--please finish the\nPokédex!
[VAR 0103(0000,0000)]!\nYou've finally done it!\cYou've finally completed\nthe National Pokédex!\cThis is better than meeting any\nexotic Pokémon for the first time!\cI feel blessed to have become friends\nwith a Trainer like you!\cSincerely, I thank you from the\nbottom of my heart!

Aww, no...\nYou're still on my tail...?\rThe lake's within sight...\cYou leave me no choice...\nMy Pokémon will KO you...\c
I can't battle anymore...\nI'm running on fumes...\cI'll have to give this to the\nCommander...\cI wish...\nI got to use it at the lake...\c
Cynthia: Oh, hello, long time no see!\nHow is your Pokédex filling up?\cI came to research the folklore\nabout the lake, but...\cWell, it doesn't appear as if the\nlake is open to the public now.\cHave you heard the folklore about it?\cThey say there is an island inside\nthe lake.\cAnd inside that island is a mirage\nof a Pokémon.\cNo one must enter the chamber\nof that Pokémon...\cOh, that's right! I had to talk to you\nabout something else...\c
[VAR 0103(0001,0000)]: Hey, [VAR 0103(0000,0000)]!\nWhere'd that Galactic goon run off to?\c
Huh?\nIs this your older sister?\cNo? She isn't?\nOh, OK.\c
That explosion in the Great Marsh?\nIt wasn't anything serious.\cMr. Wake told me to tell you that.\cBut that Team Galactic... Wow! Are they\nout of control or what?\cNext time I see them, I'll teach them\na lesson they won't forget!\cSee you around!\c
Cynthia: He's your friend?\cHe's more impatient than he is\nenergetic, isn't he?\c
Cynthia: So, getting back to what I\nstarted saying earlier...\cHave you seen the group of PSYDUCK\non Route 210?
Cynthia: Yes, that's right.\nBy the café on Route 210.\cYou've seen that group of PSYDUCK\nhuddled with their heads in their,\ruh, hands...?\c
Cynthia: You haven't seen them?\nBy the café on Route 210.\cThere's a group of PSYDUCK huddled\nwith their heads in their, uh,\rhands...?\c
Anyway, what you should do is use\nthis medicine on the PSYDUCK.\cYou're working on a Pokédex, so it\nwould be worthwhile for you.\c
Cynthia: I went on a big adventure\nwith a Pokédex when I was younger.\cI hope you get to meet every kind\nof Pokémon there is to see.\cIt may help you with the secret of\nthe mirage Pokémon.\cSee you later!\c
They say there's a legendary Pokémon\nin this lake.\cI aim to capture it on film like I've\ndone before.\cIt was me who filmed that red GYARADOS\nat Lake of Rage.
The Pokémon of the lake won't come out\nif it senses people.\cWe're lying in ambush for it here.
Stop, stop!\nYes, you!\cSunyshore City, which is down this\nroad, had a major blackout!\cCrews are working on restoring\npower, but the road's closed now.\c
Stop, stop!\nYes, you!\cSunyshore City, which is down this\nroad, had a major blackout!\cCrews are working on restoring\npower, but the road's closed now.
What am I to do...?\cI've gone and dropped my Suite\nKey somewhere again...\cThe hotel people won't be happy with\nme...\cI'm sure I had it when I left the\nreception counter earlier...\cIf I only had the Pokétch app Dowsing\nMachine, it would be so easy to find...

Seven Stars Restaurant\nMore Flavor Than You Can Wish For
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Text File : 402
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
At our restaurant, you can enjoy\nmore than just exquisite dining.\cYou may also partake in battles.\nBon appetit!
I am so sorry.\nWe are now closed.\rPlease do visit while we are open.\c
Before we make our toast, I'd hoped\nfor a battle...\cHowever, you seem to be short\na Pokémon for that.
If you want to have a battle with us,\nyou'll need to bring more Pokémon.
With someone as beautiful as you for\nmy model, I am sure to paint\ra masterpiece!\c
What is it?\nDo you wish for a battle?\c
                                               
Though we lost our battle...\nA toast to your beauty, that no\rpainting could ever hope to capture!
He said he'd treat me to a dinner\nhere if I agreed to model for him.\cSo, I came along, but I haven't\nmade up my mind yet.\c
When I can't decide, I battle\nto make the decision!
                                                           
I've decided to model for him.\nThat's given me an appetite!
There is no price too high for the\nsake of my art...\cThat said, my oh my, these meals\nlook awfully pricey...\c
What is it?\nAre you feeling hungry, too?\cOh, I see, that's not it!\nYou wanted a battle!
                                           
My hors d'oeuvres have gone cold...
I have to slow down on eating these\ndelicious hors d'oeuvres.\cI don't want to be all bloated by\nthe time the main dish comes.\c
I'd like a light battle to work up\nmy appetite.\cWould you care to join us?
                                                                  
The hors d'oeuvres haven't grown\ncold...\cThese are supposed to be served\nchilled!
The worth of a meal isn't determined\nmerely by its flavor.\cPresentation, that is, color and\nplacement, is vital.\cIn other words, a fine meal can be\nlikened to the finest work of art...\c
And in Pokémon battles, I also hope\nto see beauty.\cYou do agree with me, yes?
                                                                                                 
The meals prepared here are not\nmerely tasty, they are also healthy.\cDiners need not worry about ruining\ntheir figures eating here.
Today's main dish is scrumptiously\ndelicious!\cIf I can keep eating this food,\nI'll model anytime I can!\c
I feel guilty just eating all this\ndelicious food like this.\cI'll join in the battle, too!
                                                              
The models of great paintings were\noften rather plump.\cThat means I can keep eating without\nobsessing over my figure!
If you want to challenge us, bring\nsome more Pokémon.
If you want to battle us, you have\nto have at least two Pokémon!
Actually, my father happens to be\nthe chef here.\c
What is it? A battle?\nBahaha... You think you can beat me?
                           
We've lost, but let's make a toast\nto our future together anyway!
Oh, my!\nYour father is the chef here?\cHow wonderful!\c
I haven't told him, but my father owns\nthe hotel and restaurant...\cOh, but that's beside the point.\nWould you care for a battle?
                                           
Let's make a toast to the prosperity\nof the restaurant!
I have to hand it to my father--\nthese hors d'oeuvres are delicious!\c
...Are you maybe asking me for\na battle?\cWell, certainly!\nI never back down from a challenge!
                            
Finally. Now we can go about enjoying\nour meal without disruption.
Yes! This meal is good enough to\nserve at the hotel.\c
Please don't tell my date that my\nfather owns the restaurant.\cI'll have a battle with you if you\nkeep your mouth shut.
                            
My date did his best, but you were\nbetter than the both of us.
Fufufu, my date's really enjoying\nmy dad's cooking.\cShe has a dreamy expression after\nevery bite!\c
I'm feeling great!\nSure, I'll have a battle with you.\cThat's why you approached us, right?
                                 
My prowess as a Trainer isn't up to\nsnuff...\cIt's not like my father's scrumptious\ncooking...
This succulent flavor!\nIt reminds me of a world trip I took.\cMy father and I traveled everywhere\ndining at only the best restaurants.\c
Eating this fabulous meal has really\nlifted my spirits.\cJoin us for a battle?
                                                        
Your father's cooking has a very\nmagical quality to it.\cIt seems to perk people up with\nenergy.
If your intention is to test your\nskill on us, I daresay you ought to\rbring at least another Pokémon.
Oh, you're offering to do battle\nwith us? How nice of you.\cUnfortunately, you simply cannot\nbattle us both with just one Pokémon.
Let me propose a toast to many\nmore happy years together.\c
Since I took my retirement, I've been\ntraveling with my wife.\cWe both enjoy searching for delicious\ndining experiences.\cYou seem to enjoy battling with\nPokémon. Am I right?
                               
Well, so much for that. Let's try to\nenjoy the rest of our meal.
To our health, welfare, and to fine\ndining! Cheers!\c
A toast before a meal helps stimulate\nthe appetite, I find.\cBut that's neither here nor there.\nYou wanted a battle, surely?
                        
Gourmet dining in restaurants and\nexhilarating Pokémon battles...\cThere is so much contentment in my\nlife!
Hmm!\nNow, this is special!\cIt appears as if it were only grazed\nwith fire, but in reality, much\rcare has gone into its preparation!\c
When you get to be an accomplished\ngourmet like myself, one can tell at\ra glance if a dish is delicious or not.\cYou would battle against such\na discerning gourmet?
                                                    
Well, so much for that.\cWe'll keep a stiff upper lip and look\nforward to enjoying the main course.
These hors d'oeuvres are simply\ndivine!\cThey tell me that I can expect the\nmain course to be fantastic!\c
I thought the main course arrived\nalready...\cYou're a Trainer seeking battle?
                                                
The hors d'oeuvres were most\nexcellent!
Hmm!\nThe chef flambeed this to perfection!\cThe rich aromas and flavors fill my\nmouth with joy!\c
You're throwing down a challenge\nin the middle of our meal?\cI would say you're a very dedicated\nTrainer, especially for one so young!
                                                      
Ah... I'm very satisfied with our\nmeal and our battle.
...!\nThis sauce!\cIt's a spicy sauce in Hoenn style\nmade from grated Cheri Berries!\c
Would you like to sample a bite?\c...\nOh, right. Pokémon?
                                              
Battling is fine, of course.\cBut for me, I would rather be out\nenjoying good meals.
If you want to battle us, you\nhave to have two Pokémon.
Don't you have two Pokémon?\nWe'll have to battle another time!
Alison, um, I, er...\nThank you for coming today...\cShould we make a toast?\c
She's the girl from the Pokémon-goods\nshop I go to all the time.\cWe're incredibly happy together.\nWould you like to battle us?
                                                   
Oh, no, I'm sorry we lost.\nAlison, you're not upset?
Fufu... Eugene, you act so different\nfrom the way you do at the shop.\cYou're surprisingly shy.\c
I work at a Pokémon-goods shop\nbecause I love Pokémon.\cThe job lets me be with Pokémon\nall day long.\cIt naturally made me pretty decent\nat battling. Want to try me?
                                             
I don't worry much about winning\nor losing.\cI keep my Pokémon with me because\nI love them!
If my Pokémon buddies hear I went\non a date with you, Alison...\cThey're probably going to hate me\nfor it...\c
Are you Alison's fan, too?
                                             
Alison, seeing your smiling face...\cI can't tell if these appetizers\nare delicious or not!
Sorry? What? Date?\cUm... Eugene...\nYou are a valued customer and all...\c
...Even though I said that, I admit\nthe invitation was flattering.\cSo I accepted his invitation.\cI'll let my Pokémon decide for my fickle\nheart. Let's battle?
                                            
You know, it is true what they say.\nThere is no evil among Pokémon fans!\cThat goes for you and Eugene!
Looks like our main course is here.\nPlease, enjoy yourself.\cI've got the bill covered today!\c
I'll defeat you and collect the\nprize money!
                                                         
My wallet's empty after paying the\nprize money...\cOh, no, it's OK! No need to worry!\nI still have my secret stash of cash!
Eugene, I think you're a little\nawkward, but you're very earnest.\c
If I team up with my date, it could\nbe an interesting combination.\cI think we could battle in an intriguing\nmanner. Do you?
                                 
The meal was delicious, and our battle\nwas so much fun.\cI really insist that we split the bill.
If you have two Pokémon, I'll take\nyou on with my mom.
I'm willing to have a battle with\nmy son, my pride and joy.\cBut you must bring more Pokémon\nthan that.
What should I have today?\nJuice, ice cream, cake, and, and...\c
Oh, hi, Trainer!\cWant to battle Pokémon with us\nbefore we have a yummy meal?
                                         
I don't get it. Grown-ups always have\na toast before eating.\cWhat's that for?\nAnd I don't see any bread?
My dear, Mommy is so proud of you\nfor doing so well on your test.\cYou may order anything you like.\nIt's your reward, dearest!\c
Did you know? My boy is not only a\ngenius at school, but he's also\ra Pokémon prodigy!\cWould you like to challenge us and\nsee?
                                               
I wish to propose a toast.\cMay my darling Esteban get another\n100% on a test!
Wow, they bring out things one dish\nat a time!\cIt's not like how it is at home!\c
I do my homework while eating.\nI can battle anytime!
                                               
We're going to eat this delicious\nstuff now. Bye-bye!
This restaurant is the talk of the\ntown for the delicious food.\c
I beg your pardon?\nYou want a battle now?\cWell, that's all right.\nIt's not as if I dislike it.
                                 
Thank you for letting my dear son\nexperience an invaluable lesson.
Do mothers and fathers go off to\neat like this?\cI mean without taking their kids\nalong.\c
But that's OK.\cIt's way more fun for me to battle\nthan go eat fancy dinners!
                                                  
Mom, you gotta make me this at home!
This is a special occasion, Esteban.\cThis is to celebrate your great\ngrades!\c
Oh? A battle, you say?\nWell, certainly. Why not?
                                               
Is the dessert coming soon?
My daughter and I always battle\ntogether, none of that one-on-one.
I can go against you with Papa.\nPlease bring more Pokémon.
Here's a toast for Mom.\nMay she always be healthy!\c
My wife's in the hospital waiting for\nthe baby to arrive.\cSince I can't cook, I came here with\nmy daughter.\cHow would you like a battle with\nus before we eat?
                         
The house will be a lot noisier when\nthe baby comes home with Mommy.
I wonder what Mommy will bring home?\nA baby boy? A baby girl?\c
A boy will be a brother, and a girl\nwill be a sister.\cI'm going to be the older sister,\nso I should get better at Pokémon!
                            
Little babies cry like Pokémon!\nPiyaaaah!
Wow... Look at these appetizers.\nThis is just so extravagant.\c
I'm no cook, I'll admit that freely.\cBut battling Pokémon... There's\nsomething I'm comfortable with.
                            
Let's get over the sting of this loss\nby enjoying this delicious meal!
Wow!\nThis food looks really fancy!\c
Papa is a rotten cook, so we can\ngo out and eat good food like this!\cDid you come to this restaurant to\nbattle Pokémon?
               
I've never eaten anything like this\nbefore.
Here's the main dish!\c
What is it?\nDid you want to battle with us?
              
Jocelyn, I hope the new baby will be\nas kindhearted as you.
I wish Mommy were here to eat with\nus...\c
Mommy gave me my Pokémon.\nWant to see how tough they are?
                            
Next time, let's come with everyone.\nThe baby, too!
Yeah? What's up?\nDid you want to be on TV, too?\cOh, right, sorry!\nYou wanted to battle!\cYou'll be battling the two of us.\nYou need at least two Pokémon.
If you want an autograph, you'll\nhave to wait till we finish filming.\cOh, and if you want to battle,\nbring two Pokémon, OK?
Let's start with a shot of the\ndrinks as a camera test.\c
Hunh? You're inviting us to battle at\na time like this?
                                          
Oh, man...\nOur drinks are lukewarm now.
Today's featured drink is freshly\nsqueezed juice made from ripened\rPecha Berries picked this morning!\c
Pardon?\nPokémon?\cOK, a quick one before we do any\nfilming for the show.
                                             
Do you think we should rehearse this\none more time?\cToday's featured drink is freshly\nsqueezed...
Hey, these appetizers sure do look\ndelicious.\cWill someone bring me a mist spray\nso they look even fresher?\c
Thanks, that was quick!\c...Wait, where's the mist spray?\nOh, you want a battle?\cWhatever, then.\nI'm up for your challenge!
                                                             
Photographing food isn't easy.\nIt's actually very technical.
These look fabulous, too.\nWe need the camera to zoom in more!\c
Please don't talk to me while we're\nfilming!\cOh, actually, hold on.\cA Trainer barges in on our\nfine-dining experience...\cI like that!\nIt adds drama to our story!
                               
Darling Darryl, are you ready?\cWhen I take a bite, I want\na close-up of my lips, all right?
Whoa...\nSo this is the main dish? Yowza!\cLet's get this filming done quick\nso I can chow down, too!\c
You've been sniffing around a lot...\nAre you messing with our filming?
                                          
Oh, no... Everything's gone cold while\nwe were battling...
Chomp!\cMmm... This is...\nLight, and yet rich flavored...\rIt delectably melts away...\rA hint of an aftertaste, yet crisp...\rNeither too sweet nor too bitter...\rMy words can't do this justice!\c
It's not easy trying to describe\nfood while you're eating.\cBut I can battle anytime during\nfilming!
                                                                                                   
Do you know what the most important\nthing is for gourmet reporting?\cIt's a...thesaurus-like vocabulary!
I'll only say this once, so listen\nclosely. I'll even say it slowly.\cTo battle against two Trainers, you\nneed two or more Pokémon.\cNow if you were to bring more\nPokémon, I could consider a battle...
Oh, you'll have to bring more Pokémon\nthan that to battle us!
And another brilliant day on the\nmarkets! A toast to my Lady Luck!\c
Since I've been with her, I've been\nriding a hot streak on the markets.\cI'm surfing on a wave of good luck!\nYou're sure you want to battle us?
                            
This is just a minor setback.\nI can easily make up for this!
Ooh! All your stocks went up again?\nYou haven't guessed wrong yet!\c
My boyfriend's a stock-market\nwizard!\cDid you know? Someone that lucky also\nhappens to make a tough Trainer.\cAre you willing to try your luck\nagainst that?
                          
It's just one loss. We can make that\nback with a big win next time!
There's no need for technique.\cYou just have to read what's in your\nopponent's heart.\c
When I say “heart,” I don't mean\nwhat that person's thinking.\cIt's about how they want to be\nperceived.\cDo you... Would you like me to think\nof you as a tough Trainer?
                               
I had a bad feeling about this\nTrainer...
No, really? Ooeeeh! That is so neat!\nHow can you tell these things?\c
My boyfriend could tell that deep\ndown, I'm actually a frightened and\rlonely child!\cI don't think I could ever lose with\nhim. Want to try?
                            
It's amazing that you predicted you\nwould lose!
Let's savor this extravagant meal\nand think of what it represents.\cWe can use that as motivation to\nkeep winning at life!\c
Personally, I think there are two\nkinds of people.\cThose who face up to challenges\nand those who duck and cover.\cYou're the type who accepts\nchallenges, am I right?
                                        
If I had the power of premonition,\nI'd be a terror on the markets.\cBut you know that's not really\npossible.
How can you guess right about\neverything all the time?\cDo you really have the power of\npremonition?\c
I'm convinced that he has some\nextrasensory power or something.\cI'm teaming up with a guy like that.\nAre you sure you want to do this?
                                         
If it's not premonition, did you...\nMaybe come from the future?
One Pokémon is insufficient if you\nwant to battle against us.
If you'd bring two or more Pokémon,\nwe could have a battle with you.
Hmm... This beverage's coloration\nborders on the positively toxic...\cHowever, my analysis indicates that it\nis composed of natural ingredients.\c
What is it?\nYou are?\c...\n...Oh, yes, a Trainer.
                                                               
The results of that battle are\ninsignificant. Let's drink up.
Oh, dear!\nI wish you wouldn't!\cWe're at a fancy restaurant, and you\nwant to analyze what's served?\c
Oh, you're a Trainer?
                                                        
Cheers, dear!\cPlease don't start analyzing what\nwe just drank!
Interesting...\nThese hors d'oeuvres are fascinating.\cPlant fiber 20%, iron 5%, protein 35%.\nCurious and curiouser...\c
What is it now? Do you want me to\nanalyze your skill level?
                                                             
I feel compelled to analyze that\nwhich is unknown to me.\cBy defining its composition, I feel\nreassured in my knowledge.
Oh, dear, must you go on that way?\nIt takes the magic out of a meal.\cI wish you wouldn't think about your\nresearch while we're out eating!\c
My husband never ceases to amaze\nme with his dedication to research.\cWould you care to have a battle\nwith us?
                                                      
If you were to ask me, I would\nrather not know about what I don't\runderstand. It's simpler that way.
By my calculations, the main dish\nshould have arrived by now.\cPerhaps the thermal setting is too\nlow to prepare the food efficiently?\c
You there!\nLet's battle to consume time!
                                                            
They brought the main course while\nwe were battling...\cThe calorie content appears to be\nalarmingly high.
There isn't any point getting\nimpatient over the food, dear.\cIsn't this the sort of situation\nthat you brought your Pokémon for?\c
Oh, what good timing!\cWould you join us for a quick\nbattle?
                                                       
Oh, dear, if we take in too many\ncalories, we can always work them off\rby battling!

Hello! It's time for We Love the GTS!\nThe show for fans of the GTS!\cExcuse me! Did you just make a trade?\nCan we get a word, please?\c...Huh? Me?\nAre you talking to me?\cUm, it makes me happy knowing I can\nalways trade for what I want here.\cBut there is something that does\nbother me sometimes.\cIt's about the moves some traded\nPokémon know.\cI mean, this one's moves are Explosion,\nCut, Double-Edge, and Reversal.\cLike, what a weird set.\nIs there any meaning behind this?\cWell, isn't that a neat story!\nIt must mean something to someone!\cThat's all until next week!
I was just your average girl until I was\nliterally stricken by a ThunderShock.\cIt was love at first sight, baby!\nAnd my target, a Gym Leader!\cI didn't have any Pokémon then, but\nnot a problem for a resourceful gal!\cThe answer was simple!\nAnd we all know simple is best!\cI just had to become a Trainer.\nThat's all it took for me!\c“The Diary of a Poké Romantic” will soon\nmake its debut!\cThe pilot episode: “Love at First\nSight! The Rules of the Move Attract!”\cBy the way, how did everyone get their\nfirst Pokémon anyway?
After some fits and starts, a childhood\nfriend gave me my first Pokémon!\c...But it was a KRICKETOT.\nWhen I don't like the legs of bugs...\cI bet he gave me this because I picked\non him when he was little...\cBut though the road has been long and\nhard, I'm finally at the starting line!\cNext week: “The Diary of a Poké\nRomantic,” episode 2!\c“The Maiden in Love and the KRICKETOT.\nThe Magic of Romance Never Ends!”\cOh, this KRICKETOT is a female.\nMaybe we can be friends.
I checked out my KRICKETOT and learned\nabout its moves.\c...It only knows Growl and Bide.\nThat's worse than just challenging!\cI was about to say that, when my\nchildhood friend stopped me.\c“Let it hold an Oran Berry so that\nit can survive while using Bide.”\cHey, that's smart!\nThat's from a former Bug Catcher!\cWhile we're at it, can I have an Oran\nBerry, too?\cNext week: “The Diary of a Poké\nRomantic,” episode 3!\c“Love Conquers All. Covering Weakness\nwith Ideas!”\cWe're a Trainer and Pokémon now!\nWe'll get stronger together!
I had my first ever Pokémon battle,\nand it ended badly...\cMy childhood friend, a former\nBug Catcher, had this to say.\c“Pokémon get tougher by battling.\nThe key to victory is type matchups.”\cType matchups?\nTypes affect battles?\cThe only type matchup I care about is\nwith that Gym Leader!\cNext week: “The Diary of a Poké\nRomantic,” episode 4!\c“Type Matchups Settle Battles!\nMoves That Exploit Weak Points!”\cFire, Flying, and Rock...\nKRICKETOT has some disadvantages!
We'd win a battle, and lose one.\nLose one, then win one.\cThough it was discouraging, I had to\nkeep battling to toughen us up.\cWith me and KRICKETOT, it was always\nthree steps forward, two steps back.\cBut we were getting stronger. Then one\nday, KRICKETOT started to shine!\cNext week: “The Diary of a Poké\nRomantic,” episode 5!\c“KRICKETOT Becomes KRICKETUNE! Watch\nMe! I'll Change, Too!”\cAnd, to cancel evolution, press the\nB Button... Tell me that first!
After KRICKETOT evolved, she became\nstronger as KRICKETUNE.\cWe also got other Pokémon, so we could\ngo farther and farther from home.\cBut where is my beloved Gym Leader?\nWhere is that city he said he's from?\cI do have the Town Map, but maps baffle\nme.\cIt doesn't matter, though.\nIf we keep moving, we'll get somewhere.\cNext week: “The Diary of a Poké\nRomantic,” episode 6!\c“How Is This Possible? Pokémon Gyms\nCan't Be Found Everywhere!”\cThe more lost you are, the less useful\na map becomes! You know it's true!
Our journey was long, and it was hard.\nBut no one wants to hear that!\cSo, I finally found my Gym Leader.\nBut, he has an incurable disease!\cHe begged me, out of the blue, with his\nlast wish.\cHe asked for my Pokémon!\nBut my KRICKETUNE's my partner!\cNext week: “The Diary of a Poké\nRomantic,” episode 7!\c“My Trail of Footprints Shortened\nthe Distance Between Us!”\cEvery time I see KRICKETUNE's face, I\nget reminded of our time together...
My beloved Gym Leader, whom I\nfought so hard to meet, was a fraud!\cHow dare he con this pure maiden!\nHow dare he toy with my emotions!\cBut whose fault was it?\nWas it mine to be taken in?\cAll I know is that my tears overflow,\nand despair is my world...\cNext week: “The Diary of a Poké\nRomantic,” episode 8!\c“KRICKETUNE and I! Our Bond Is True!”\cThat Gym Leader's eating a Giga Impact\nfor playing me for a fool!
Having defeated the fake Gym Leader,\nKRICKETUNE and I stood in a daze.\cWe were spent. Drained by a romance\nthat ended as a nightmare.\cIt was then my childhood friend, the\nformer Bug Catcher, arrived.\cHe did more than that.\nHe confessed his love to me!\c“I wanted to become an Elite Four\nmember so I quit as a Gym Leader.\c“But, then, that faker appeared.\nYou took care of him, though!”\cWait, ex-Bug Catcher! What?\nWhat are you saying?!\cNext week: “The Diary of a Poké\nRomantic,” final episode!\c“Do it, KRICKETUNE! Silver Wind over\nSinnoh Skies!”\cYou were laughing at me for falling for\nthat fraud, weren't you?

[VAR 0103(0000,0000)]: That lake has a mirage\nPokémon living in it.\cEveryone says it's just a legend, but\nI know I'm right.
[VAR 0103(0000,0000)]: Hey, do you know about\nthe Champion?\cThere's this out-of-this-world tough\nTrainer who gets called that.\cWell, I'm gonna get so tough, the Champ\nhas to battle me. You watch!\cWith this little guy here, I'm sure I can\nget that tough.
[VAR 0103(0000,0000)]: Hey, that's enough\ntalking already.\cI'm itching to get going to the lake.\nCome on, come on!
[VAR 0103(0000,0000)]: All right!\nLet's move out! Hustle up!
                                                          
                                                        
                                                
Cheryl: It's startling to see two wild\nPokémon appearing at the same time.
Cheryl: My Pokémon is an excellent\nhealer.\cBut attacking isn't its strong point.
Cheryl: [VAR 0103(0000,0000)], battling with\nyou makes me feel elated.\cIf I could predict what you're about\nto do, we would make a fierce combo!
Cheryl: That's some nice moss...
Mira: Are you going to use that?\nI will be left all alone...
Mira: Are you going to use that?\nI will be left all alone...
Mira: That isn't the right way.\nI'll be lost if we go down...
Mira: I like helpful Pokémon moves\nlike Growl and Minimize.\cThose kinds of moves are my\nfavorites.
Mira: This cave...\nIt's so easy to get confused here.\rDo you know where we are?
Mira: [VAR 0103(0000,0000)], did you get to be\nso good because you're always with\ryour Pokémon?\cYes! That has to be it!\nI will try like you!
Riley: If you use that, I'll have to\nwave good-bye to you now.
Riley: If you use that move, I'll have\nto wave good-bye to you now.
Riley: Haha, I'd have to agree.\cPeople training here would be those\nwith too much time on their hands.
Riley: This used to be a fairly\nthriving ore mine once upon a time.\cI guess the steel ore's played out.\nThere's only Pokémon here now.
Riley: Have you met Byron?\nThe Leader of Canalave Gym?\cHe's asked me to become a Gym\nLeader, but there's his son Roark\rto consider as well.
Riley: Imagine what it would be like\nfor a Steel-type Pokémon user to\rbattle a Steel type.\cWould that be like battling yourself,\nI wonder?\cI mean, it's a lot harder to defeat\none's self than anyone else.
Riley: What's going on here, though?\nThe native Pokémon are restless...\cI don't like this...\nLet's hurry.
Riley: Thanks.\nYou really helped me out.\cListen, I have a Pokémon here\nnamed Luca.\cWould you take it with you?\c
Riley: Thanks!\cI want you to show Luca all sorts\nof worlds.\c
Riley: Thank you...\cBut you don't have room to take\nanother Pokémon.\cAll right, then.\nI'll wait here for you.
Riley: I hope you'll accept it as\na token of our friendship.
Riley: Spending time with you was\nvery enjoyable.\cI intend to test my skills in other\nplaces from now on.\cIt would be great if we could meet\nagain.\c
Marley: ...Are you going to leave\nme here?
Marley: ...Are you going to leave\nme here?
Marley: ...Sorry, but I'm not\ngoing up.
Marley: ...It isn't that way.
Marley: ...You're very chatty...
Marley: ...The Pokémon among\nflowers...
Buck: Whoa, [VAR 0103(0000,0000)]!\cIf you use that, me and my Pokémon\nwill be left behind. Don't do it!
Buck: Whoa, [VAR 0103(0000,0000)]!\cIf you use that, me and my Pokémon\nwill be left behind. Don't do it!
Buck: This is where I raised my Pokémon.\cI can't stand the thought of anyone\nmaking a mess of this place.\cEspecially not those weird Team\nGalactic goons!
Buck: There's no law that says\nI have to be tough or anything,\rbut losing isn't fair to my Pokémon.\cAfter all, they try so hard for me.\cI think it's my responsibility as a\nTrainer to recognize their hard work.
Buck: My big brother's one of the\nElite Four.\cSo, of course it's only normal that\nI'd be better than ordinary folks.\cBut that's not what I want.\nI want to be tough on my own terms.\cIt wouldn't be fair to the Pokémon\nthat chose to be with me.
Buck: It might be cool being a Gym\nLeader or one of the Elite Four...\cBut, then again, it sounds like it'd\nbe a lot of hard work!

Too slow!\c
[VAR 0103(0000,0000)]: All right!\nLet's get moving to Prof. Rowan's lab.\c
[VAR 0103(0000,0000)]: ...\n...\cWhat?\nDon't go into the grass, right?\rNo worries! No problem!\cIt doesn't matter that we don't have\nany Pokémon.\cTrust me on this one.\nI've got an idea!\cNow listen. You know how wild Pokémon\njump out when you go into tall grass?\c
So, what you do is, you scoot over to\nthe next patch of grass before any\rwild Pokémon can appear!\cIf we just keep dashing, we can get to\nSandgem Town without running into\rwild Pokémon!\cOK, stick with me!\c
OK, here goes!\cOn your marks...\c
[VAR FF01(00C8)]Hold it![VAR FF01(0064)]\c
Professor: You two don't seem to have\nany Pokémon between you?\cThen, what is the meaning of going into\nthe tall grass?!\c

You two.\nYou truly love Pokémon, do you?
[VAR 0103(0000,0000)]: Whoa, hold up!\nYou're not making any sense here!\c
Professor: Er-hem!\cI didn't quite catch that, so I will\nask you again.\cYou two.\nYou truly love Pokémon, do you?
[VAR 0103(0000,0000)]: Me, too!\nI love Pokémon, too!\c
Professor: I will ask you once again.\cYou two.\nYou truly love Pokémon, do you?\c
[VAR 0103(0000,0000)]: What?!\nYou can ask a hundred times!\rThe answer will never change!\cWe'll both answer a hundred times,\nwe love Pokémon!\c
Right, [VAR 0103(0001,0000)]?
[VAR 0103(0000,0000)]: ...\nThat joke's getting old!\c
Professor: ...A pair of reckless kids\nwho foolishly try to enter tall grass\rwithout Pokémon of their own...?\cIt worries me what people like that\nwould do with Pokémon.\c
[VAR 0103(0000,0000)]: ...Uh...\nWell, I, uh...\c...\n...\cWell, then forget about me, but give\na Pokémon to my friend here!\cI mean, it was me who tried to go into\nthe tall grass and all...\c
Professor: !\cHow big of you...\cVery well, then!\nI will entrust you two with Pokémon!\cI apologize for putting you through\nthat exercise.\cHowever!\cYou must promise me that you will never\nrecklessly endanger yourselves again.\cNow, then...\cHm?\nNow, where...?\c
Dawn: Professor Rowan.\cYou left your briefcase at the lake!\c
Oh?\nIs something wrong here?\c
Lucas: Professor Rowan!\cYou left your briefcase behind at\nthe lake.\c
Is something wrong here?\c
Rowan: Ah! There it is!\nDawn, nice work.\cWhat I was about to do was to entrust\nthese two with their own Pokémon.\c
Rowan: Ah! There it is!\nLucas, nice work.\cWhat I was about to do was to entrust\nthese two with their own Pokémon.\c
Dawn: Pardon?!\cThose Pokémon are hard to replace.\nAre you sure about giving them away?\c
Lucas: Wha...?!\cThose Pokémon are crucial.\nYou're giving them away?\c
Rowan: Hm!\cWe exist side by side with Pokémon.\cThere comes a time when people should\nmeet Pokémon.\cThere is a world that should be\nexplored together.\cFor them, today is that time.\nThe place, right here.\c

Hey, [VAR 0103(0001,0000)].\nYou can choose first.\cHey, I'm practically a grown-up.\nI have to show some class here.

Uh, sorry, folks.\c

Heheh, [VAR 0103(0001,0000)]!\nWe've both got Pokémon now.\cThere's only one thing to do, right?\nAre you up for this?\c

[VAR 0103(0000,0000)]: Me and you together,\nwe've got nothing to fear!
[VAR 0103(0000,0000)]: Heheh, [VAR 0103(0001,0000)].\nThe lake's not that way!\c
[VAR 0103(0000,0000)]: Hey, [VAR 0103(0001,0000)]!\nI said, the lake's not that way!\c
Wild Pokémon lurk in tall grass. They\ncan come bursting out at any time.\cSo, if you're wanting to battle wild\nPokémon, just walk in tall grass.\cIf you want to avoid wild Pokémon,\nthen stay out of the tall grass.
Hi!\nI work at a Pokémon Mart.\cDid you know that a Pokémon's health\nis measured by Hit Points (HP)?\cIf a Pokémon runs out of HP, it\nfaints and can't battle anymore.\cIf a Pokémon's HP gets low, you\nshould heal it with a Potion.\cHere, let me give you a Potion as\na free sample. First one's free!\cIt will automatically go in the\nMedicine Pocket of your Bag.\c
You can find a Pokémon Mart in cities\nand most major towns.
That ledge is one way. Jump down\nfor a shortcut to Twinleaf Town!
If your Pokémon's health--that's its\nHP--is getting low, you should go\rhome and get some rest.
If your Pokémon's health--that's its\nHP--is getting low, you should go\rto a Pokémon Center!

The Damp Mulch slows the drying of soil.\cHowever, it also slows the growth of\nBerries.\c
The Stable Mulch extends the time\nBerries remain on their plants.\cSome growers use it in hard-to-reach\nlocations that may be overlooked for\rharvesting.\c

Welcome.\cHere, you may challenge the mansion's\npride--the five Trainer maids.\cThe challenge is to beat all five of us\nin a row without a break.\cIn addition to beating us, if you can\nbeat us in a specific number of turns,\rthere will be a special gift.\cIncidentally, a turn refers to the time\nit takes for a Trainer and the opponent\rto each make an action.\cIn this case, action refers to making a\nPokémon use a move, using an item, or\rswitching a Pokémon.\cAnd now...\c
The 5-Maid Knockout Exact-Turn Attack\nChallenge!\cToday's targeted number of turns is\n[VAR 0134(0000,0000)]! Would you like to try?
Oh, how disappointing...\nPlease take the challenge sometime.

I'm so sorry. Everything beyond this\npoint is strictly off-limits.\cPlease, you really mustn't.\nMr. Backlot will be so cross with me!
First up! My favorite color is blue!\nI will open the proceedings!\c
The next person up is quite strong,\nreally.\c
I'm pleased to meet you in battle.\nMy best color is green!\c
I was no. 2, and a little bit tough!\nThe next maid is even tougher!\c
My lucky color is yellow!\nThe sunshine girl! That's me!\c
The next maid is a wee bit stronger\nthan I am.\c
Pink is the color I can't do without!\nI'm the fourth in line!\c

Wonderful!\nYou're a marvel of a Trainer!\cOh, I'll ask you not to pry into what\nI'm doing in the back of the mansion.\cThis knowing wink is all you'll get out\nof me.\c

That [VAR 0103(0001,0000)]...\nWhat is that Trainer thinking?\cWhy make me join the team, then call\nupon me for nothing?\cAm I considered useless?\nIs the Trainer regretting having me?\cDoes the Trainer dare disrespect\nthis [VAR 0100(0000,0000)] so easily?\c
I have little understanding of\n[VAR 0103(0001,0000)] as a human...\c[VAR 0103(0001,0000)] may not be too bad,\nconsidering that I, an oft-shunned\r[VAR 0100(0000,0000)], am one of the team...\cThat said, I don't intend to be all\ncheerful around [VAR 0103(0001,0000)]...\c

Not for a moment did I think I would\nbe traveling with a human...\cIf my [VAR 0100(0000,0000)] friends were to\nsee me now, they would be shocked.\cOr would they be envious of me...?\c
That [VAR 0103(0001,0000)] is the most\nimpressive of humans.\cIt takes a lot to make me,\n[VAR 0101(0002,0000)], sunny and cheerful!\cAs a show of affection, I should\nchomp down on the Trainer's neck...\cHahaha... Have no fear...\nI was merely joking...\c

Pal Park is a place where you are\ntimed on the catching of six Pokémon.\cYou are provided with six special\nPoké Balls for the challenge.\cParticipating Trainers are required to\nsupply the six Pokémon that are to\rbe caught.\cIf you do not supply the stock of six\nPokémon, you may not participate in\rthe Catching Show.\c...Do you want me to explain anything\nelse?
At the start of the Catching Show,\nyou will be given six Park Balls.\cUse the Park Balls to catch the\nsix Pokémon you provide.\c...Do you want me to explain anything\nelse?
You may make Pokémon migrate from\nKanto or Hoenn. Doing so will stock\ryour Catching Game.\cInsert a Game Boy Advance Pokémon\nRuby, Sapphire, Emerald, FireRed,\ror LeafGreen in the Game Pak slot.\cWhen your DS is turned on, currently\ncaught Pokémon can migrate from\rthe Game Pak to the DS Game Card.\c...Do you want me to explain anything\nelse?

The only items you ever throw are\nPoké Balls!\cBut is that true?!\nI want people to think about that.\cThat's why I give away the Technical\nMachine Fling.\c
Using that move, the Pokémon hurls\nwhatever item it's holding at the foe.\cThe move's effect depends on what\nitem is hurled.\cRemember, the move Fling fails if the\nPokémon isn't holding anything.
When I first started fishing, catching\nanything made me happy.\cBut those days are long gone now...\cNow I get annoyed if I can't beat my\nrecord by even an inch...
I can't explain it.\nI get more easily agitated at night.

It keeps a Pokémon asleep.\cBut lately, I've been hearing rumors\nabout vandals in Stark Mountain.\cThey say goons in space suits are\ncausing trouble there.\c
Huh?\nWhat, me?\cI was on my way to the Pokémon Center\nbecause my Pokémon's low on HP.\cSo, if you could get up to Stark\nMountain now, that'd be great. Thanks!\c

I'm the Day-Care Man.\cWe look after the precious Pokémon\nof other Trainers.\cIf you'd like us to raise your\nPokémon, have a word with my wife.
Ah, it's you!\cWe were raising your Pokémon,\nand my goodness, were we surprised!\cYour Pokémon was holding an Egg!\cWe don't know how it got there,\nbut your Pokémon had it.\cYou do want it, don't you?
Ah, it's you! Good to see you.\nYour [VAR 0100(0000,0000)]'s doing just fine.
Well then, I'll hang on to it.\nThanks!
You have no room for it right now...\nCome back when you've made room.
[VAR 0103(0000,0000)] received the Egg from\nthe Day-Care Man.
You take good care of it.
By the way, I saw your [VAR 0100(0000,0000)]\ncavorting with [VAR 0103(0001,0000)]'s\r[VAR 0100(0002,0000)].\cI may even have seen it receiving\na piece of Mail.
If you want to pick up your Pokémon,\nhave a word with my wife.
Ah, it's you!\nGood to see you!\cYour [VAR 0100(0000,0000)] and [VAR 0100(0001,0000)]\nare doing just fine.\c
I really will keep it.\nYou do want this, yes?
The two seem to get along very well.
The two seem to get along.
The two don't seem to like each\nother much.
The two prefer to play with other\nPokémon more than with each other.
I'm the Day-Care Lady.\nWe can raise Pokémon for you.\cWould you like us to raise your\nPokémon?
Which Pokémon should we raise for\nyou?\c
Fine, we'll raise your [VAR 0100(0000,0000)]\nfor a while.\cCome back for it later.\c
We can raise two of your Pokémon.\nWould you like us to raise another?
Ah, there you are!\nMy husband was looking for you.
Oh, fine, then.\nCome again.
You don't have enough money...
Do you want to take back the other\none, too?
Very good.\nCome again.
Ah, it's you! Good to see you.\nNow, about your Pokémon...\c
By level, your [VAR 0100(0000,0000)] has\ngrown by about [VAR 0133(0001,0000)].\c
Your Pokémon team is full.\nMake room, then come see me.
Which Pokémon will you take back?
If you want your [VAR 0100(0000,0000)] back,\nit will cost $[VAR 0135(0001,0000)].
Excellent!\nHere's your Pokémon.\c
[VAR 0103(0001,0000)] took [VAR 0100(0000,0000)] back\nfrom the Day-Care Lady.\c
Oh? But you only have one\nPokémon with you.\cYou can't go off without a Pokémon.\nCome back another time.
Do you want your Pokémon back?
If you leave me that Pokémon,\nwhat are you gonna battle with?\cCome back another time.
Huh? Now, now.\cIf you leave that Pokémon with\nme, you'll be left with just one.\cYou will be better off if you catch\nsome more, if I do say so myself.
Now, now.\nThat is merely an Egg!
Fine, we'll raise your [VAR 0100(0000,0000)]\nfor a while.\cCome back for it later.
Huh?

...\cHmm...\nI see...\cThis Pokémon seems to be rather\nhappy.\c
Well well!\cYou've made your Pokémon evolve\nalready?!\c
Hm!\cEntrusting you with that [VAR 0100(0000,0000)]\nwas no mistake, it seems!\c
Professor: Well, would you like to give\nit a nickname?

Professor: When I first saw you two \nabout to step into the tall grass\rwithout Pokémon, I was shocked.\cI was astounded by these foolhardy\nchildren.\cBut now, you've astounded me in an\nentirely different way.\cAlready, there is a bond growing\nbetween you and that Pokémon.\cI feel privileged to have met you.\cI'm sure [VAR 0100(0000,0000)] feels the same\nway about you.\cThat's why I'll ask you to cherish that\n[VAR 0100(0000,0000)] of yours.\c

Lucas: Boy, am I glad you're kind\ntoward Pokémon.\cIf you weren't, well...\nI don't even want to think about it.\c
Professor: Er-hem!\nLet's move on to the main topic.\cThere is something I want you to do\nfor me.\c
Allow me to properly introduce myself\nfirst.\cMy name, as you know, is Rowan.\nI study Pokémon.\cFirst of all, I want to know exactly\nwhat kinds of Pokémon live in the\rSinnoh region.\cTo do so, it is necessary to collect\ndata using the Pokédex.\cThis is what I wish to ask of you.\cI want to entrust you with this\nPokédex.\cWill you use it to record data on all\nthe Pokémon in Sinnoh for me?
Rowan: ...\c...\c...\c...\cI can stand here without speaking for\nhours. I'm a very patient man.\cLet me ask you again, [VAR 0103(0000,0000)].\cI want to entrust you with this\nPokédex.\cWill you use it to record data on all\nthe Pokémon in Sinnoh for me?
Rowan: Hm!\cGood answer!\c
[VAR 0103(0000,0000)] obtained\nthe [VAR FF00(0001)]Pokédex[VAR FF00(0000)]!
Rowan: That Pokédex is a very\nhigh-tech device.\cIt will automatically record data on\nevery kind of Pokémon you encounter.\c[VAR 0103(0000,0000)], I ask that you go\neverywhere and meet every kind of\rPokémon in this region!\c
Dawn: I've got one, too!\c
Lucas: I've got the same kind of\nPokédex as you.\c
Rowan: When you walked up Route 201\nwith your Pokémon, what did you feel?\cI've lived for 60 long years.\nEven now, I get a thrill when\cI'm with a Pokémon.\cNow, you should know that there are\ncountless Pokémon in this world.\cThat means there are just as many\nthrills waiting for you out there!\cNow go!\c[VAR 0103(0000,0000)], your grand adventure\nbegins right now!\c
Rowan: Go on!\c[VAR 0103(0000,0000)], your grand adventure\nawaits you!
Dawn: The Pokémon that I met for\nthe first time was [VAR 0100(0001,0000)]!\cIf you would have chosen [VAR 0100(0001,0000)]\non Route 201, we'd have the same\rPokémon now!\cNot that it matters, but...\cAnyway, I'm Dawn.\cI also help the professor add pages\nto the Pokédex.\cSo, in a sense, I'm just like you.\cI just got a little head start on you,\nthat's all.\cI'll be happy to teach you things.\nGlad to meet you, [VAR 0103(0000,0000)]!\c
Lucas: The professor asked me to help,\nso I'm filling the Pokédex pages, too.\cThat makes us comrades working toward\nthe same goal.\cI'll teach you stuff later, OK?\c

Hmm...\cSo, you've seen [VAR 0134(0000,0000)] Pokémon.\c
What's wrong?\cYou're not going to tell me you've\nseen too few to bother showing me?
Excellent work, [VAR 0103(0000,0000)]!\cThe Pokémon of the Sinnoh region are\nbeing added to your Pokédex.\cThis will certainly help with my studies\nof Pokémon evolution...\c
Rowan: Hm! [VAR 0103(0000,0000)], I've been\nwaiting to see you!\cYou've met every kind of Pokémon\nthere is in the Sinnoh region!\cThis will help immensely with my\nstudies on Pokémon evolution...\c
Oak: Greetings, Professor Rowan!\nIt's been a very long time!\cI'll tell you, Sinnoh certainly is\na long trip from Kanto.\cOf course, if it means meeting new\nPokémon, there's no distance too\rgreat for the likes of us to travel.\c
Rowan: Oh! If it isn't my old\ncolleague, Professor Oak!\cI should have expected as much from\nthe world's authority on Pokémon!\cWe always used to joke, “Where\nthere are Pokémon, you'll find Oak!”\cIt's good to see that hasn't changed\none bit!\c
Professor Oak, let me introduce you\nto my young assistant.\cThis youngster has filled every page\nof the Sinnoh Pokédex for me.\c
Oak: Ah, well, very glad to meet you!\nAs you've heard, my name is Oak.\cI've been hearing a great deal about\nyou from Professor Rowan lately.\cHe's been exuberant in praise about\na fantastic young Trainer.\cI see that you live up to--no--that\nyou've surpassed his praise.\cYou've also got an impeccable sense\nof timing.\cYou see, I had an errand to run for\nProfessor Rowan on my visit here.\cHe'd asked me to bring the data\nfor the National Pokédex, you see.\cSo, since you're here, let me upgrade\nyour Pokédex with the National Mode.\cAfter all, there are many kinds of\nPokémon in this world of ours!\c
[VAR 0103(0000,0000)]'s Pokédex was upgraded\nwith the National Mode!\c
Oak: I'm afraid it won't be easy to\ncomplete the National Pokédex.\cHowever, I'm sure you will make an\nhonest attempt on our behalf!\c
Rowan: Have no fear, [VAR 0103(0000,0000)]\nwill get the job done.\cBy the way, Professor Oak, what\ncompelled you to visit this region?\c
Oak: Ah, yes. I've heard that the\nPal Park is now open.\cIf I remember correctly, it's at the\nend of Route 221.\cThe Pal Park has a special system\nthat attracts every imaginable kind\rof Pokémon from every region.\cI've come to make certain that\nsystem is operating properly.\c
[VAR 0103(0000,0000)], you should make an\neffort to visit the Pal Park, too.\cOops! I'll be late for my meeting if\nI don't get going!\cOK, it was a pleasure seeing the both\nof you! Bye, now!\c

Rowan: Off he goes, as busy as\never...\c
Now, [VAR 0103(0000,0000)]...\cI have a gift here as your reward\nfor completing the Sinnoh Pokédex.\c
Rowan: That's the Pokémon Radar,\nor just Poké Radar for short.\cUse it, and it will indicate grass\npatches where Pokémon are lurking.\cI'd prepared that to help my field\nassistants put together the Sinnoh\rPokédex, but you took care of that!\cI'm sure it will be useful for your\ngoal of filling the National Pokédex.
Rowan: The world is immense.\nThere are many more Pokémon.\cThat means there are many more\nthrills for you to seek and enjoy!

Rowan: Oh, yes, there was something\nI had to tell you.\cThe three Pokémon of the lakes appear\nto have returned to their homes.\cSo, tell me.\nHow are things going for you?\cThe Pokédex...?\cHm! A total of [VAR 0134(0001,0000)]!\n...And the number of Badges?\cWell! You've got seven already!\nThat only leaves Sunyshore's Gym.\cHm! You've come this far.\nWhy not obtain Sunyshore's Badge?\cAnd why not challenge the Pokémon\nLeague?\cThat will broaden your horizons\nfurther than ever before.\cNot to mention the opportunities to\nmeet even more Pokémon.
Rowan: Oh, yes, [VAR 0103(0000,0000)].\cIf you see Cynthia, please give her \nmy best regards.

Use that Sprayduck to water the soil\nwhere you've planted Berries.\cYou should also water Berry plants\nwhile they are growing.

Do you think it's cute how\nPokémon pluck Berries?
Yes! You agreed!\nHere's the TM for the move Pluck!\c

Catching Pokémon is best accomplished\nby whittling the target's HP down as\rlow as possible, then tossing a Ball.\cBut a Pokémon caught that way can't\nbe used in battle right away.\cThat's where the Heal Ball comes in\nhandy.\cYou can lower the target's HP bar to\nred, put it to sleep, or paralyze it.\cThe Heal Ball instantly heals whatever\nails the Pokémon it catches!\cThat's the Pokémon-friendly Heal Ball!\nPlease, do give it a try!
When attempting to catch a Pokémon,\nyou want to cut the target's HP.\cBut a fleet-footed Pokémon could\nbolt if you take too much time.\cThe Quick Ball is the solution to\nthat dilemma.\cIt's designed to work best when\nthrown right at the start of battle!\cThe Quick Ball: the perfect gift for\nthe impatient Trainer!
The Pokémon of the mothering sea\naren't like the others.\cIf you are brave enough to face such\nintimidating Pokémon, the Dive Ball is\rperfect for you.\cFor Pokémon you meet in the sea, and\nfor Pokémon caught fishing...\cThe Dive Ball is the Poké Ball you can\ncount on!

The cave painting's meaning seems\nto be this...\cThere existed beings...\cBeings so powerful, they were\nconsidered deities at the time.\cThere were three Pokémon with power\nto match either being.\cThe three kept balance with either\nbeing, as if they formed a pyramid.\cIt's an ancient legend of Sinnoh\nthat is still told in Celestic Town.\c

[VAR 0103(0000,0000)] examined the ancient\ncave painting.\cMysterious designs cover a whole\nsection of the wall.\cThere are three strange things forming\na triangle.\cIn the middle of them, a shining\nsphere...
Cynthia: This cave painting...\nIt's always been described this way.\cThe light in the center represents\neither DIALGA or PALKIA appearing\rat the Spear Pillar.\cThe three lights around it were thought\nto be UXIE, MESPRIT, and AZELF.\c
May I continue?
Cynthia: But, then, I realized that\nthere may be another way of\rinterpreting this.\cCould this triangle of lights actually\nrepresent a different trio?\cCould they be DIALGA, PALKIA, and\nGIRATINA instead?\cAnd the large light at their center.\nDoes it represent something else?\cCould it be what created this world of\nours?\cMay I continue for a little bit longer?
Cynthia: Thank you for listening to\nmy theory.\cDo you know of the ancient Plates they\nfind all over Sinnoh?\cOne of them had this engraved on it.\c“Two beings of time and space set\nfree from the Original One.”\cI think this quote, too, points to the\npresence of another Pokémon.\cA Pokémon even more powerful than\nDIALGA or PALKIA.\cDoes that sound plausible to you?\c
I'm not quite sure how GIRATINA fits\ninto this scheme of things, but...\cIt's said that in the Distortion World,\nneither time nor space were stable.\cI think that tells us something about\nGIRATINA, the only Pokémon there.\cIt must have been as powerful as\nDIALGA and PALKIA, the rulers of time\rand space.\cIn some way, though, GIRATINA has to\nhave a power opposite of theirs.\c
I'm sorry this is so long.\nMay I say one last bit?
A long time ago, I wonder what sort of\nperson painted this?\cDIALGA's Roar of Time...\nPALKIA's Spacial Rend...\cTo the people back then, those Pokémon\nreally must have appeared to rule\rover time and space.\cSeeing them must have shaken the\npeople to their very core.\cThis painting represents those feelings\nof awe, wonder, and everything else.\cIt passed that memory to countless\npeople, eventually becoming a myth...\cThat's what I believe as a researcher\nof myths.\cI think I let myself get carried away\nand talked for far too long.\cI'm sorry, and thank you.\nLet's meet again.\c

A word of advice from a grizzled\nmountain man!\cStark Mountain is a harsh, harsh place\nthat's rife with Fire-type Pokémon.\cWater-type Pokémon and moves should\ntake the edge off.\cThat's my advice.\nYou'd best heed it, no joke!
I was on a 54-win streak...\nIf only I used that move when...

The building next door?\cI see Gym Leaders go in and out every\nso often.
The Battle Factory lets you make\nchallenges without your own Pokémon.\cMaybe I should try...
In a Multi Battle, coordination with\nyour partner is vital.\cBy working together, one plus one\ncould become not just two, but even\rthree or four.\cBut one times one is always one.\nDo you understand that?
Some say the universe was shaped by\nsomething born from an Egg...\cA man I met long ago told me that.

Oh? So, you are?!\nYou're Buck's friend, yes!\cI've heard about you from both Buck\nand Wake.\cWell, my young friend, you're always\nwelcome here from now on!\cThis is a private club for only Sinnoh's\nGym Leaders, or those vouched for by\rthose selfsame Gym Leaders.\cIt's a place where the best seek to\nbetter themselves.\cWelcome to the Battleground!
What should we talk about today?\n...Ah, I know.\cLet me tell you about the volcano named\nStark Mountain.\cThat volcano dates to when Sinnoh was\nmade by the melding of time and space.\cFiery lava spilled out and pooled, and\nthen it became a Pokémon.\cIt's said the Magma Stone was used\nto keep the Pokémon pinned down.\cIt kept the Pokémon from rampaging\nand the volcano from erupting.
Welcome to the Battleground!\nMake yourself at home like always.
                                                                                                            
                                                                                                  
Buck: My place is open only to the\ntoughest Trainers--I'm serious.\cYou're supposed to be introduced by\na Gym Leader, but you're special.\cWell, I'm off to the Battle Frontier.\cI feel like seeing how far I can go up\nthe Tower.\c
                                                                                                                               
              
              
              
              
              
Roark: I went down to the Underground\nevery day.\cI toughened up my Pokémon by digging\nup Fossils nonstop.\cCould I show you how tough I made them\nin a battle?
Roark: Here goes! These are my rocking\nPokémon, my pride and joy!\c
Roark: This is another topic, but you\nknow those Spheres you can dig up?\cYes, those Spheres.\nThe ones in the Underground.\cWhy do you suppose Spheres grow if\nyou leave them buried?\cIt's not a huge issue or anything, but\ndoesn't it strike you as odd?
Roark: Look, can I have some time?\cI feel lucky to have run into you here,\nso can I challenge you to a battle?
Roark: ...We lost control there.\cNext time, I'd like to challenge you to\na Fossil-digging race underground.
Roark: Would you like to battle?\cYou'll get to see a different me than\nyou saw at my Gym.
Roark: I've got a TYRANITAR I'm going\nto send out.\cIt's tougher than even my dad's\nAGGRON!\c
Roark: Hmm...\nThat's a heartbreaking answer.
Roark: Oh, you do want to battle?
Roark: Pokémon from ancient\ntimes...\cFossils that are yet to be\ndiscovered...\cI wonder if I can find new Fossils if\nI dig all over Sinnoh?
Roark: When I became a Gym Leader,\nI finally realized how great my dad is.\cNot that I'd ever admit that to him,\nof course.
Gardenia: Hi, have you been keeping\nwell?\cLet's cut to the good stuff!\nLet's get down to battle!
Gardenia: Yes, that's right!\cA battle will tell you if someone you\nhaven't seen's been keeping well!\c
Gardenia: You won't battle?\nYou're not in the mood, huh?\cWell, why not polish your Badges, then?\nThat might put a shine on your day, too.
Gardenia: Oh?\nYou do want a battle?
Gardenia: Out of the Gym, a Gym Leader\nis just another Trainer.\cBut wherever I go, I still try to be as\ntough as I can.\cIt's not fair to my Pokémon if we were\nto lose because of me.
Gardenia: My Grass-type Pokémon are\ngrowing good and strong.\cI'm kind of interested in what Pokémon\nyou have, too.\cWant to battle?\nA real quick one?
Gardenia: I can't deny that Grass-type\nPokémon have many weak points.\cBut I'll show you that's not the only\nfactor in deciding who wins!\c
Gardenia: Aww, really?\cMy grass Pokémon are growing good\nand strong, too...
Gardenia: My Grass-type Pokémon are\ngrowing good and strong.\cCome on, let's battle!\nA real quick one, OK?
Gardenia: By the way...\nHave you been to the Old Chateau?\cMe? Uh, well, you know, I have my Gym\nLeader job and all, so...\cWell, actually, I'm here training...\n...I'm here just for fun...\cAhahaha!\nDon't mind me!
Fantina: Finally, you have arrived!\cSo, you shall challenge me.\nAnd I shall win.\cYou will be startled by how much\nstronger I have become!
[VAR FF01(00C8)]Ohohoho!![VAR FF01(0064)]\c
Fantina: You... You disappoint me.\nIt is very sad.\cBut, realize, you have not beaten me\nif you refuse.
Fantina: This time, you shall challenge\nme, yes?\cBut I shall win.\cYou will be startled by how much\nstronger I have become!
Fantina: You are an amazing person!\nTrès fantastique!\cI am delighted--for now I have a\npurpose!\cMy purpose, it is to defeat you!\nIt is a gift from you to me!
Fantina: Oh? It is you?\nAre you not taking part in Contests?\cSince you are involving yourself in\nContests, you should challenge me.
Fantina: Pokémon battles, they are fun,\nalways without fail.\cWhy, you ask? Because, in those\nmoments, we are at our most serious.\c
Fantina: No?\nWell, that is OK, also.\cJust seeing your face, it has made me\nhappy.
Fantina: Yes, what is it?\nI accept your challenge if you give it!
Fantina: I wish to battle as if I were\ndancing.
Maylene: I think it's OK if I were to\nkeep losing to the same Trainer.\cBattling that person tells me how much\nmy Pokémon and I have changed.\cThat's why I would like to challenge\nyou for a rematch now, [VAR 0103(0000,0000)].
Maylene: OK! Rei!\nOh, that's my bow before a match.\c[VAR 0103(0000,0000)], I'm throwing everything\nI have at you!\c
Maylene: Sigh...\cI braced myself for a battle.\nThis is a little deflating...
Maylene: Yes, what is it, [VAR 0103(0000,0000)]?\nWould you maybe like a battle?
Maylene: I love visiting here.\cBuck's grandpa cooks for us, and it's\nall delicious.\cThat's not all! We can eat all we want.\nIsn't that amazing, [VAR 0103(0000,0000)]?
Maylene: Being together with Pokémon\ngave me the strength to keep going.\cPlease, [VAR 0103(0000,0000)], accept my\nchallenge!
Maylene: OK, here we come,\n[VAR 0103(0000,0000)]!\c
Maylene: OK! Got it!\cWe'll train much harder so we can\nbattle with you, [VAR 0103(0000,0000)].

Wake: What's there to do for Trainers\nhere?\cSeems to me there's nothing to do but\nbattle!
Wake: My Pokémon have new Water-type\nmoves under their belts!\cLet's see how you bear up under them!\c
Wake: Then, you get my song instead!\nEr-hem!\cThe ring is my roiling sea. ♪\nThe towering waves shaped me.\cCrash! Crash! Crasher Wake!\nCrash! Crash! Crasher Wake!\cI'm the tidal wave of power to wash\nyou away!\cPut out the fire, Crasher Wake!\nRun from electricity, Crasher Wake!\cAh, ah, aaaah!\nThe ring is my sea. ♪
Wake: Words aren't needed.\cWe understand each other through\nbattle!\cThat's what makes us Trainers!
Wake: Battles that end with both sides\nenjoying the experience without caring\rabout the winner or loser...\cThat's what I strive for.\cOne of these days, I hope to battle\neveryone in the world...\cIsn't that right, [VAR 0103(0000,0000)]?!
Wake: All right!\nHow's it going?\cMy Pokémon were toughened up by\nstormy white waters!\cThey'll take everything you can throw\nat them and then pull you under!\cVictory will be ours!\nCome on, let's get it done!
Wake: That's the spirit!\nBring it on!\c
Wake: Whoops!\cYou're giving me the slip?\nYou're a slick one, [VAR 0103(0000,0000)]!
Wake: So, what's the story?\nAre we gonna battle?
Wake: For all the training I do, there\nare still plenty tougher than me.\cThe stronger I get, the farther away\nthe goal seems to be.\cThe road is harsh and long.\nThere's no end to it.\cBut beside me always are my Pokémon.\nEvery inch of the way!
Byron: I've faced many a challenger at\nmy Gym.\cI trained on Iron Island while\ncontemplating my worth for days...\cI have the confidence now to batter\ndown your defenses.\cCould I ask you for a rematch?
Byron: We are tempered and honed by\nbattling the strong.\cHere's to our showdown!\c
Byron: When you came to the Gym, you\nhad a glint that's dulled now.
Byron: I have the confidence now to\nbatter down your defenses.\cCould I ask you for a rematch?
Byron: I trained by pummeling steel\ncontinuously on Iron Island alongside\rPokémon...\cGwahahahaha!\nI could still use more toughening up!
Byron: Since we last lost to you, we've\nbeen in training.\cI think we've addressed our\nshortcomings.\cCould I ask you for another rematch?
Byron: Thank you!\cLike me, my Pokémon were longing for\nanother chance to battle with you!\c
Byron: Gwahahaha!\nThat's disappointing, but all right!\cThere's a lot to be learned by battling\nyou. We had our hopes up.
Byron: Could I ask you for another\nrematch?
Byron: Argh...\nCame up short again...\cDo I talk to my son Roark to train\ntogether...?\cNo, that's too embarrassing...\nHmm... This is a dilemma...
Byron: ...That Roark thinks he can show\nup his old man?\cMy act needs polishing still, I fear...\cAh, it's you!\nDon't mind me. Make yourself at home.
Candice: Hiya!\nWhat's up?\cI bet you can't tell what I'm thinking!\cI'll give the answer away.\nI want to battle with you!
Candice: This time, Candice is going to\npush through on willpower!\c
Candice: Oh...\nDid my willpower intimidate you?
Candice: Listen, listen.\nYou'll battle Candice, won't you?
Candice: Oh, wow, your scarf is totally\nin fashion.\cI wish I had one like that.
Candice: Candice is on fire!\cI'm blazing hot!\cHot enough to melt Ice-type Pokémon!\cI need a battle to cool me down!
Candice: OK! I'll show you how good\nCandice...\cI mean, how good my Pokémon can be!\c
Candice: Awww!
Candice: You really want to battle\nwith me, don't you?
Candice: Awww!\nThat's it!\cI'm going to train so I can throw a\nFocus Punch myself!
Volkner: Your Pokémon...\nI can feel their power!\cOf course, you can sense the power of\nmy Pokémon, can't you?\cLet us battle with you!
Volkner: Yeah! It's electric, this\nfeeling of anticipation!\cLet's do it!\nWe're going to make some sparks fly!\c
Volkner: Aww, come on now.\nDon't disappoint me...
Volkner: Hm? What's up?\nYou do want to battle?
Volkner: Winning makes me happy, and\nlosing leaves me angry...\cThat's no great revelation, but it's\nwhat makes me stronger.
Volkner: My ELECTIVIRE demands tough\nopponents.\cI'm willing to beg.\nLet's battle!
Volkner: You! And me!\nLet's make some sparks fly!\c
Volkner: Well, yeah, an ELECTIVIRE is\nintimidating. I hear you...
Volkner: Hm? What's up?\nYou're willing to face my ELECTIVIRE?\rAnd help toughen up my Pokémon?
Volkner: Some Trainers have Pokémon\nthey just have to have in their party.\cFor me, ELECTIVIRE is that Pokémon...

Cheryl: I should warn you, my Pokémon\ncan be quite rambunctious.\c
Cheryl: Giggle...\cPokémon would get worn out if we\nbattled all the time, wouldn't they?
Cheryl: ...Yes?\nWould you like to battle after all?
Cheryl: Being a Trainer isn't easy.\cThe more you battle, the more you\ndiscover.\cBut, you know?\nI love Pokémon for that, too!

Riley: Battling is our way of greeting!\c
Riley: All right, then.\nSo, what've you got to tell me?
Riley: See? It just doesn't feel right\nif we don't battle, does it?
Riley: Know your enemy.\cIf you know your opponent's Pokémon\nand what moves they use...\cIf you have intelligence like that, your\nchances of winning are much improved.
Riley: Hi. Long time, no see.\cIf it's all right with you, I'd like to\nchallenge you to a battle right now.
Riley: We're pulling out all the stops\nto put your Pokémon down.\c

The original owner's furniture is gone,\nand I didn't buy any.\cSo, yeah, I know, it's barren.\nStill, not bad, eh?\cBut anyway, I feel kind of bad just\nimposing the place on you for nothing.\cI'll tell you what, order a Table from\nthis order form.\cThat'll do as my thanks to you!
Go ahead, order a Table from this\norder form!
Whoa, whoa!\nDon't go yet!\cNot until you order a Table from this\norder form!\c
Thank you for waiting!\nI'm delivering your order!\cWe hope you'll keep ordering quality\nfurnishings from us!\c
The furniture place's service is great.\nThey're real eager for business.\cLook, they left another order form on\nthe Table they delivered.\cAnyway, I'm finally rid of this Villa\nthanks to you.\cNow I can go back to traveling\nlike I always wanted.\c
                         
                                                                                                        
Thank you for waiting!\nI'm delivering your order!\c
Thank you for waiting!\nI'm delivering your order!\cAlso, and I hate to say this, but...\nWell, the truth of the matter is...\cWe're completely out of furniture that\nwe could sell you...\cThank you so very, very much for your\nlong-standing patronage and support!\c
[VAR 0103(0000,0000)]: Hey, [VAR 0103(0001,0000)]!\nYou got yourself a Villa now?\cWoohoo, that's wicked awesome!\nYou must be rich! Gimme something!\cOK, this is what I'm gonna do.\nI'll tell everybody you got a Villa!\c
Dawn: Wow, [VAR 0103(0001,0000)], this sofa is\nso sumptuous!\cYou know, I think we have similar\ntastes, [VAR 0103(0001,0000)].\c
Lucas: Is this sofa to your taste,\n[VAR 0103(0001,0000)]?\cI can't get comfortable sitting on\nsomething this expensive looking.\c
Rowan: Hm, that's rather a good\nBookshelf.\cThe curved surfaces describe sublime\nlines of an indefinable charm.\cHere, allow me to give you this book\nI've been reading as a gift.\c
Gardenia: Oh, hey! A Houseplant!\cIt's really nice!\nMaybe I'll get some for my Gym...\cThe green coloring and the aroma...\nIt's very nice.\c
Cynthia: Oh...?\nThis is a good piano.\cI love the sound a piano makes.\nI savor every note with my entire being.\cIt's not only my ears; my spirit hears\nthe music it makes...\cEhehe, I made myself cringe saying\nthat.\c
[VAR 0103(0000,0000)]: Too slooooow!\cYou keep me waiting all the time!\nI'm fining you...$1 billion!
[VAR 0103(0000,0000)]: So, anyway, how are\nthings at the Battle Frontier?\cMe? You know I'm on top of it.\nI lose at the Tower sometimes, but...
[VAR 0103(0000,0000)]: Oh, yeah, the other day\nat the Battle Tower...\cAww, never mind!\nI'm not telling you I battled my daddy!
[VAR 0103(0000,0000)]: This is a cool place you\nhave here.\cI've kind of got to like it, so I'll drop\nin for no reason at all from now on!
[VAR 0103(0000,0000)]: You know, I've been\nthinking lately...\cIf we didn't meet Prof. Rowan then,\nwhat would we be doing now?
Dawn: [VAR 0103(0001,0000)], are you going to\ncollect furniture now?\cAre you maybe the type who can't bear\nto use Technical Machines?\cThe sort of person who ends up making\na collection of them?
Dawn: I had no idea that you can get\na Villa as a gift.\cWho knows what can happen in life?
Dawn: I'm envious of you having your\nown place.\cI have to share a bedroom with my\nlittle sister!
Dawn: Sigh...\cTo be with that special someone in a\nwonderful Villa like this...\cI think it's a nice dream to have.
Dawn: You run into so many Pokémon in\nthe Battle Zone. It's a bit much.\cSo, [VAR 0103(0001,0000)], please let me catch\na little rest.
Lucas: [VAR 0103(0001,0000)], are you collecting\nfurniture, too, now?\cAre you one of those people who can't\nstand to use Technical Machines?\cOne of those types that end up with\na TM collection out of hoarding?
Lucas: You could get a Villa as a\ngift? I did not know that.\cI wish someone'd give me a Villa.\cThat way, I'd be able to assist the\nprofessor even more!
Lucas: The Battle Zone's intense and\nfun, huh?\cSo many different kinds of Pokémon,\nand Trainers of every variety...\cI'd like to go to even more places.
Lucas: Having this Villa must be\nconvenient.\cIt must be useful for checking up on\nthe Pokémon in the Battle Zone.
Lucas: You can find so many different\nkinds of Pokémon in the Battle Zone.\c[VAR 0103(0001,0000)], you don't mind if I rest\nfor a bit, do you?
Rowan: Hm!\nHow are things going for you lately?\cEven if you manage to see every kind\nof Pokémon, that's not the end.\cIt would be impossible to know all about\nthem based on sightings alone.\cThere's much to be learned from\ntraveling with Pokémon.
Rowan: Hm!\nYou seem well.\cIncidentally, did you know there are\nsome Pokémon that evolve only at\rspecific locations?\cFor example, several Pokémon evolve by\nleveling up in Mt. Coronet.\cThe variations of evolution...\nHow many could there be?
Rowan: Hm!\nYou seem well.\cIncidentally, did you know there are\nsome Pokémon that require the use of\rspecific items to evolve?\cMAGMAR and ELECTABUZZ are examples\nof such Pokémon.\cI never imagined that there would be\nnew patterns of evolution.\cThe variations of evolution...\nHow many could there be?
Rowan: Hm!\nYou look well.\cIt's commonly accepted that Pokémon\nevolve to grow more powerful.\cThere must be other reasons than that.\nI would like to know during my lifetime.
Rowan: Hmm...\cThis place feels like the home I shared\nwith a friend long ago.\cIt has the same sort of atmosphere.
Mom: Oh, [VAR 0103(0001,0000)]!\nI'd heard from [VAR 0103(0000,0000)], but...\cThis is quite grand for a Villa.\nThis makes me happy, dear!\rI'll have a fun place to visit!
Mom: [VAR 0103(0001,0000)], this Villa, if I\nwere to give it a grade...\cIt would earn a perfect score!\nIt makes me happy just being here.
Mom: If it were me, I would put that\npiece of furniture over there...\cOops, sorry.\nThis is your place, [VAR 0103(0001,0000)].
Mom: It must make you happy collecting\nthe furniture.\cBut I'm wondering: do you collect\nAccessories?\cEven if you don't enter Contests, it's\nfun to dress up Pokémon.
Mom: I think Contests and home designs\nsay a lot about the person.\cIf the person's character shines\nthrough, I think people respond to it.
Roark: The Underground extends\neven underneath the Resort Area.\cI wonder... If I really tried, would\nI be able to extend it to even places\rlike Kanto and Johto?
Roark: If it were me, I would display\nthe things I dig up.\cYou know, from places like the mine and\nthe Underground.\cI would turn the place into my personal\nmuseum.
Roark: If it were me, I'd like to put\na Fossil over there.\cYou don't think so? No?\nI think a Fossil would match this decor.
Roark: This place feels different from\nan underground Secret Base.\cThat reminds me: what color is your\nunderground Flag now?
Roark: What I think about while digging\nunderground...\cWhat did the Pokémon see before they\nbecame Fossils?\cI'd love to go back and see them as\nthey were back then.
Gardenia: Sigh... This is so dreamy...\nThe Resort Area's a nice place.\cOf course, Eterna is a good place, too.\nWe have the huge forest, first of all.
Gardenia: I know it's a little abrupt,\nbut don't you think Grass-type Pokémon\rsmell nice?\cIt makes me happy just being around\nthem.
Gardenia: I could tell you ten good\nthings about Grass-type Pokémon.\cWhich kind of Pokémon can you say\ngood things about?\cOoh, maybe ten won't be enough.
Gardenia: Do you remember those rumors\nabout the Old Chateau?\cThey say there really were ghost\nPokémon there in the old days.\c...That's so scary.\nWhat if they suddenly came back?
Gardenia: ...I'm in a dilemma now.\cYou see, I don't like ghost Pokémon\nvery much.\cBut, what if...\cWhat if there was a Grass-type ghost\nPokémon? What then?
Fantina: Oh, c'est fantastique!\nThis is where you practice dancing, non?
Fantina: Whenever and wherever, dance,\ndance, dance!\cIf you dance all the time, the dancing\nat the Contests, they become\rchallenges no longer.
Fantina: Ooh la la!\nThis is very nice!\cIt is often that I come to the Resort\nArea also.\cIt is because the Ribbon Syndicate, it\nis here.\cTherefore, I will visit your Villa\noften also!
Fantina: Ooh la la!\nI have an inspiration!\cThe combination of moves for a Contest,\nit has come to me in a flash!\cVery well! We shall meet at the Contest\nHall, yes?
Fantina: You!\cHave you met Dahlia?\nShe of the Battle Arcade?\cThat woman! The way she dances!\nEspecially the way she wiggles!\rOoh la la! I love her style!
Maylene: [VAR 0103(0001,0000)], please hear how\nmy training is going.\cThanks to my training, it doesn't feel\nso cold to be in deep snow!\cWell, just a little...
Maylene: [VAR 0103(0001,0000)], please hear how\nmy training is going.\cThanks to my training, my handwriting\nhas improved tenfold!\c...Yes. It has absolutely nothing to do\nwith how strong I am as a Gym Leader.
Maylene: [VAR 0103(0001,0000)], please hear how\nmy training is going.\cThanks to my training, I can tell how\nstrong my opponent is beforehand.\cOh, yes, [VAR 0103(0001,0000)], you're\nridiculously tough.
Maylene: [VAR 0103(0001,0000)], please hear how\nmy training is going.\cThanks to my training, I'm beginning to\nunderstand the feelings of Pokémon.\cIt lets me choose moves with much more\nconfidence!
Maylene: [VAR 0103(0001,0000)], please hear how\nmy training is going.\cLately, my father has been overseeing\nmy training!\cWell, only when he wins at the Game\nCorner, but...\cI'm still delighted he does this with me!
Wake: Hey!\n[VAR 0103(0000,0000)] told me to come.\cThis is some spread you've got here!\nIt's spectacular, yeah!\cHow would I put it now...?\cIt's, uh, spectacular!\nIt is what it is!
Wake: Mmmmm...!\nListen, you!\cHow would you like to decorate these\npremises with my trophies?\cNo, scrap that thought!\nHow about a wrestling ring?
Wake: I've been thinking, though.\cThat pal of yours, [VAR 0103(0000,0000)], and\nPalmer are father and son all right.\cI mean, just seeing them, they're\nhilariously alike.\cTheir overall atmosphere and their\nmannerisms and such...\cSeeing them cracks me up.
Wake: ...This place here...\nYou don't have a microphone handy?\cHow am I supposed to perform my\nsignature song, I'd like to know?\cAh, ah, ah.\nThe ring is my roiling sea. ♪
Wake: I was meaning to ask you, by the\nway...\cYou're tuning in to my wrestling\nmatches on TV, aren't you?\cIn wrestling, you always have to be\naware of what the other guy's doing.\cThat's the same as Pokémon battling,\nwouldn't you say?\cSo, what I'm saying is, watch me wrestle\nif you want to get better at battling!
Byron: Gwahahahaha!\cI spent a long time living on Iron\nIsland.\cA place this fancy, I feel a little out\nof place.\cDon't get me wrong, it's a great place.\nIt's nothing like my son's!
Byron: Well...\cI have to admit I'm not very interested\nin furniture and the like.\cMy interests run more to things like\ndigging tools, obviously.\cThe shapes of Pokémon fangs and claws\nare interesting, too.
Byron: Digging underneath Iron Island\nwas a good time in my life.\cWorking alongside Pokémon constantly\nfor iron ore...\cBut that's all in the past.\cThe young people today should find\ntheir own paths to happiness.
Byron: Roark is still a boy, but at the\nsame time, he's a man in his own right.\cThat's why our opinions clash at times,\nand why we break out in battle.\cGwahahaha!\nYou weren't supposed to hear that!\rForget I said it!
Byron: You're acquainted with a fellow\nnamed Riley, aren't you?\cHe's a mystifying sort, that one.\cI have no idea how old he is, to tell you\nthe truth.
Candice: Giving you an Icicle Badge made\nme think.\cIt made me realize this one thing.\cI don't have to act cool out of\ncharacter. I just have to be me!
Candice: In a battle, when both sides\nare down to their last Pokémon...\cWhat do you think about then?\cI put all my trust in that Pokémon\nand cheer it on.\cThat's all you can do!
Candice: Whew...\nThe Resort Area is pretty warm.\rMaybe Candice is overdressed?
Candice: This furniture...\nOh, I get it... It's like this...\cOh, please don't mind me.
Candice: Why does the Snowpoint Gym\nLeader have to guard that icy temple\ranyway?
Volkner: I was told by Flint that we're\nmeeting here.\c...That's funny.\nYou haven't heard anything about it?
Volkner: Every one of my Pokémon are\ntop class in potential.\cThey're all potential game breakers!
Volkner: Oh, yeah.\nI decided not to join the Elite Four.\cI got an earful about not renovating\nthe Pokémon League building.\cWell, no. I'd rather be a Gym Leader\nwhere I could meet ordinary folks.
Volkner: My ELECTIVIRE is a force of\nnature to be reckoned with.\cNo, don't get me started.\nI'll tell you another time.
Volkner: Hmm...\cThis place gives me ideas about how\nI can renovate my Gym.
Cynthia: I think I could get to like\nthis atmosphere.\cIt gives me an idea about the kind of\nperson that lives here.\cYes... An honest person who loves\nPokémon...
Cynthia: It's so relaxing here...\cSigh...\nI don't want to go home.\cIt's a complete mess with all my\nresearch papers strewn about.\cMy house?\cEven the region is a secret!
Cynthia: What's necessary to become\nstronger?\cI think it's important to never lose\nyour love of Pokémon.\cThat's all I can say because that's\nhow it was for me...
Cynthia: The Spear Pillar...\nThe Distortion World...\cDid the people in the distant past see\nthe same things as us?\cCould that be what led them to leave\nthe cave painting of Celestic Town?
Cynthia: When you are facing a Trainer\nin a battle, you can learn everything\rabout them.\cWhat Pokémon they have.\nWhat moves they've taught.\rWhat items they make Pokémon hold.\cThere's no need for words then.\cThat's why I'd like you to come see me\nagain at the Pokémon League.
Flint: Hey, you!\cYou used my prize money to buy this\nfurniture, didn't you?\cSo, I've got a right to lounge here,\nam I right?
Volkner: My relationship to Flint?\nThere's no love lost, that's for sure.
Flint: Hey, listen, you!\cIf that Volkner tries to sell you on\nElectric-type Pokémon, ignore him!\cYou have to go with Fire-type Pokémon.\nIt's the way of the future!
Volkner: When I got my first Gym Badge,\nI used the move Thunderbolt.\cEver since, I've stuck with the Electric\ntype even as I got better.\cI do it because I don't want to ever\nforget how happy I was when I won.\cIncidentally, Flint's fascination with\nthe Fire type is only from his name.\cSomeone told him that a flint is what's\nused to spark a fire, and that was it.
Flint: ...Volkner.\cVolkner: What?\cFlint: Let's say I'm in a battle, OK?\nWhat if I didn't use my Poké Balls?\cInstead, I can have my guys come in\nand out of my Afro to battle.\cThat'd bewilder the other guy, huh?\nWouldn't that be hilarious?\cVolkner: ...Maybe.\nDon't ruin things for others, though.
Flint: Hmm...\cVolkner: What's wrong?\nYou're looking serious for a change.\cFlint: It's this place.\nYou know how drab the League is?\cDon't you think the place should be\nmore, you know, festive?\cWith more decorations, awards, and\nthings like that?\cVolkner: Don't start! That will make\nmy Gym stand out less.
Flint: Say, hey, Volkner.\nWhat do you say we battle here?\cVolkner: ...Are you kidding?\cThat's why you Elite Four are called\nirresponsible.\cFlint: What, we are?\cVolkner: Well, at least you are.\nI tell everyone you're irresponsible.
Maylene: What makes a Gym Leader a\ngood one?\cCandice: Gee, I wouldn't know.\nThat's a tough question.\c...Maybe we should ask Gardenia\nsometime.
Maylene: ...You know those Accessories\nfor Pokémon?\cWould it be funny if someone were to\nwear those?\cCandice: What is it, Maylene?\nDid you want some Accessories?\rI'll give you some of my favorites.\cMaylene: ...!\nTh-thank you so much!
Maylene: ...Candice?\cCandice: Yes?\cMaylene: Oh, sorry, it's nothing!\nI didn't say anything!\cCandice: Giggle...\nI like lounging here.\c
Maylene: Candice, what does it mean to\nbe strong?\cCandice: I can't answer that!\cLet's go look for that answer\ntogether.\cWe've got Pokémon and [VAR 0103(0001,0000)] on\nour side, after all.\cMaylene: Yes, please!
Maylene: ...This is delicious!\cCandice: Then have some more.\cMaylene: Yes, please.\cCandice: There's plenty to drink.\nYou're a growing girl!

All I need to be happy is my TV.\nThat's all I need.\cI learn so much just sitting here.\nI absorb knowledge!\cI learned about the Pokétch app\nMarking Map, for instance.\cThey say the Marking Map can track\nPokémon that travel around.\c...I've never met any traveling\nPokémon, but I've heard about them.
There's big trouble!\nThey're saying the volcano'll erupt!\cI might even have to leave here!
The best Trainers from all over\ncongregate at the Battle Frontier.\cIt's not limited to Sinnoh, no.\cIt must be a happy achievement to\nbe able to win there with your favorite\rPokémon you've caught yourself.
You've seen every Pokémon in Sinnoh!\nThat is so cool!\cI'm going to travel with Pokémon when\nI get bigger!

Here I come!
Yeah!\c
Bleah!\c
Hey, rookie!\nBring it on!
Yeah, I knew it.\nYou're a rookie after all.\c
Bleah!\nYou're just a rookie!\c
I gotta say it, shorts are the best!\nThey remain comfy and easy to wear!
Shorts are the greatest!\c
I'll never stop wearing shorts.\nNot for anybody!\c
I make it a policy to wear\nminiskirts!
Miniskirts are the ultimate!\c
What's your policy?\c
I love my miniskirt!
Caught you snoozing!\c
Miniskirts make legs look longer!\nIs that a good thing?\c
I'm on the lookout for adorable\naccessories.
Let me know if you find any nice\naccessories!\c
I wish I could dress up!\c
I want to test out something I\nlearned at private school.
Yes!\nIt worked perfectly!\c
Hmm...\nSomething's wrong here.\c
Uh... Wroar!
A battle is about momentum and\nwillpower.\c
OK, so willpower doesn't cut it on\nits own.\c
I study every day because I want to\nwork all over the world.
My dream is worldwide!\c
I need to study up on Pokémon\nbattles.\c
When I grow up, I'm going to be a\nPokémon professor!
Er-hem! Er-hem!\nYou've much to learn, youngster!\c
Er-hem! Er-hem!\nSeems I've much to learn still!\c
When the subject is Pokémon, I simply\ndon't lose!
It's a victory of knowledge!\c
I'm going to review the subject!\nAnd I'll subject you to my revenge!\c
Oh, now you look wimpy.\nI might win this.
I so did it!\c
Ouch, that hurt.\c
It's fine, fine.\nNo need to say a word.
It's fine, fine.\nYou tried your best, I know.\c
It's fine, fine...\nNo need to say a word...\c
I'm rich!
Well, of course.\nI'm rich.\c
What happened?\nI'm rich, aren't I?\c
Hmm. So, you're good, huh?
Hmm. You're no big deal.\nHmm?\c
Hmm. So, you are good.\nHmm.\c
Oh, yes.\nI shall attack now.
I've done it!\c
Oh, how disappointing.\c
Over it is, your adventure.\nCome hither and get whupped!
A done deal, it was.\c
Oh, how vexing this so is.\nVerily, I thank you.\c
How boring...
So truly boring...\c
That was a good way to waste some\ntime.\c
Hunh?\nWhere is everyone?
Hey, guys!\nWhere are you?!\c
I came to camp, but I think I got\nseparated from my friends...\c
Oh!\nYou have a Pokétch too?
I was fooling around with my\nPokétch, but I still won!\c
I was fooling around with my\nPokétch, and I lost...\c
My Pokémon trained in forests.
It's the power of the forests.\c
I'm going back to the forest.\c
I'll battle you like I'm on a picnic!
Lalala!\c
Pretending this is a picnic won't let\nme win.\c
Ooh-la-la!\nHere we come!
Ooh-la-la!\nSo happy I won!\c
Ooh-la-la!\nEven losing can't dampen my spirits!\c
I'll teach you what's fun about\nbattling.
Battling me was fun, wasn't it?\c
Oh, my, that was inspiring!\nYou're the greatest!\c
I... I can swim, really!\nI don't need my inflatable tube!
It... It's true!\c
I... I'm not lying!\c
I like rivers more than the sea.\nWhich do you prefer?
Water in rivers is cold, but it feels\njust super.\c
I don't like the sea because the\nsalty water burns my eyes!\c
Go, go, go!\nGo, my Pokémon!
That's the way!\nWay to go, my Pokémon!\c
Good effort!\nWay to go, my Pokémon!\c
The beach sand is so hot! It makes\nme go, “Ouch, ouch, ouch!”
I love the sea!\c
Ouch, ouch, ouch!\c
Splish, splash!
Ker-splash!\nKer-splash!\c
Flip, flop!\c
I'm a girl in love with her inflatable\ntube! Nice to meet you!
Thank you! I'm a girl in love with\nher inflatable tube!\c
Good-bye! I'm a girl in love with her\ninflatable tube!\c
Oh, yeah! I'm feeling it!\nI'm tuned in to your wavelength!
Tadaaaah!\c
Tch!\nLosing threw off my rhythm!\c
Rock? Jazz? Techno?\nAnything'll do for my sound track!
Squeeeeeal!\c
So, yeah... You've got me in the\nmood for singing the blues...\c
Let's get this session on!
You're obviously short on practice.\c
My dream of a world tour...\nIt seems so far away...\c
Oh, hello...\nWell, isn't that a chic scarf!
Where did you buy that scarf?\c
Oh, you! You're not just fashionable,\nyou're good with Pokémon! How unfair!\c
Thanks for supporting me!
Oh?\nYou're not my fan?\c
What a horrible way to treat\nan Idol...\c
La, lala, lah.
La lalala.\nLalalah lah.\c
Bye-bye, lalah!\c
Let's see who loves Pokémon more,\nyou or me.
Fuhaha! Looks like my love for\nPokémon trumped yours!\c
Grr... Your love of Pokémon is\nstronger than mine?\c
I tell ya, my Pokémon are some kind\nof tough.
You don't want to underestimate me.\c
You're some kind of mighty.\c
OK, show me your favorite Pokémon.\nDon't be shy now, come on.
I see...\nCute, but on the weak side.\c
I see!\nCute, and yet tough.\c
My Pokémon are cute, but they're\nnot very tough!
Oh?\nWe won? Seriously?\c
It's OK. I like my Pokémon.\nThat's all that matters.\c
I've been pampering my gang too\nmuch lately. Can they do it?
Ooh, they did it!\nI knew I could count on my gang!\c
Pampering Pokémon too much is\nno good...\c
Won't you join our Pokémon Fan\nClub?
There's all sorts of fun things to\ndo if you join!\c
Join us!\nBecome a Pokéfan like me!\c
May I take your order, please?
Ah, a fine choice.\nOne loss served fresh.\c
Ah, an excellent choice.\nA win served fresh.\c
What I really hoped to become\nwas a cook.
I don't mind this job now, mind you.\c
I just find it hard talking to\nstrangers.\c
For battles and order taking, speed\nis essential!
Like, chop-chop!\nYou got served.\c
Food is like battling.\nServe it while it's hot!\c
My job is about serving others.\nBut don't expect me to serve here.
Mufufu.\c
Why couldn't you serve me?\nYou won't make friends that way!\c
Isn't this cute?\nMy uniform.
It's my favorite!\c
You messed up my uniform!\c
You're good, aren't you?
Oops.\nI'm a little disappointed.\c
I knew you were a tough Trainer.\c
I catch and raise all sorts of\nPokémon.
See?\nI've raised them pretty good.\c
I need to raise my Pokémon some\nmore!\c
I'll snag you with my net!
It's in the bag!\c
Hey!\nDon't run away!\c
Where can I find a giant HERACROSS?
I want a huge HERACROSS.\nLike, king size!\c
If only I had a giant HERACROSS...\c
Prepare to lose!
The enemy is mine!\c
I lie shattered...\c
Behold my fearsome ninja technique!
Hahah!\nYou saw it!\c
You didn't fall for my fake ninja\nboasting!\c
I shall become a real ninja when\nI grow up!
Excellent! Excellent!\c
So, what's a real ninja supposed to\ndo?\c
Should I torment you?
Yay! Yay!\c
No!\nNo tormenting me!\c
My mommy made this outfit for me.
Isn't it cute?\c
My mommy is really good at sewing.\c
Let's do our best, everyone!
Thanks, everyone!\c
Waaaaah!\c
Sure, we're going to battle, but\ndon't be over the top about it.
Hey, relax, relax.\nIt's best to be natural, dig?\c
You have to loosen up some more.\c
Fish, fish, fish, that's what I do!\nI'm gonna fish it all up!
Kahahah!\nI am at the top of my game!\c
Oh, waah!\nI let that get away!\c
Exploring relics isn't all fun and\ngames!
Your skill level says you probably\nwon't make a good Ruin Maniac.\c
Danger lurks everywhere in ruins!\c
These mates of mine traveled the\nworld with me!
What do you say?\nPretty tough, right?\c
Maybe it's time we hit the road\nagain...\c
Hey, there! Check this out!\nMy rare Pokémon!
Not just rare, either.\nMy Pokémon are tough, too!\c
Aiyah! Hey! Wait!\nNo! Stop! Don't touch!\c
Now just be patient.\nI'll show you my private collection!
See, see? Weren't they awesome?\nThey're the most super of the uber!\c
Awawawah... My...\nMy Pokémon...\c
Look! This is my favorite parasol!\nOh, and my fabulous Pokémon!
Aren't they both cute?\c
I'm only showing you!\nYou can't have any!\c
Have you ever seen a rainbow?
Have you wondered what lies beyond\na rainbow?\c
Seeing a rainbow makes me think good\nthings are in store.\c
If you were the weather, what\nwould you be now?
Right now, I'm feeling sunny\nwithout a cloud in the sky!\c
I'm feeling fogbound...\c
I really don't like weak Trainers!
You don't inspire much trust...\c
A Pokémon Trainer should be tough\nand bursting with life!\c
Lately, I've had a lot to worry\nabout...
Winning makes all my worries seem\ntrivial!\c
You just added to my worries...\c
This may hurt a little bit, but we'll\nbe done quick. Hold still!
There! Done!\c
Ooh, no!\nThat hurts!\c
Sniff... Sniffle...
Sniffle... Snuffle...\nI think I have a cold...\c
Sniff... Sniffle...\nMy nose is clogging up...\c
Sniff...
Now what could this aroma be?\c
Do you have some cologne on?\nYou smell sort of nice!\c
You're going to lose, but you'll get\nto enjoy a nice aroma!
Kyahaha! That's what you get for\nswooning to my aroma!\c
Kiiiih!\nI am so angry!\c
Let my guitar howl!\nHear me scream!
Yeahey!\c
Giyaaaah!\c
You should channel your feelings into\nsongs with sincerity, man.
The way I feel now?\nIt's rock!\c
The way I feel now is kind of folksy.\c
Now hear me!\nThe Bird Keeper's credo number one!
Soar high on a win!\c
Rest your wings on a loss!\c
Let's both do our best!
Yup, we both did the best we could!\c
Good going!\c
Fly, fly, fly!\nWe're going to rule this battle!
Zoom!\c
We're gonna crash!\c
I'm the Sailor among Sailors!\nI was born on the high seas!
The waves rocked me to sleep!\nThe sea was my mother!\c
Urp... Gweh... So, when I get up on\nland, I get no-motion sickness...\c
The sea, my beautiful sea!
Oh... I hear them...\nI hear the sound of waves...\c
I want to become a big man.\nBig like the sea big.\c
Yahoo!
Come on!\nYou holler too!\c
Gweff! Hack! Hack!\nHollering choked me up!\c
You should aspire to the Hiker's\nway of life!
You see?\nYou love my lifestyle, don't you?\c
Now, come on now!\nYou should look up to the way I live!\c
My Pokémon and I are Idols!
Say what you will!\nWe're Idols!\c
We have you beat when it comes down\nto popularity...\c
Watch me!\nAll eyes on me!
Ooh...\nThis is what I live for...\c
I became an Idol because I wanted\neveryone to see me!\c
I'm too into battling...\nThey might fire me as an Idol...
Battling is too much fun!\c
I can't help myself.\nNo one can keep me from battling.\c
I run a marathon every morning!\nIt's great!
My buff physique makes for easy\nwins!\c
So I lost!\nI can still run great marathons!\c
I'll run on the spot while battling\nfor the good of my health.
Let's hear it for good health!\c
Gasp!\nMy ankle! I rolled my ankle!\c
Out of the way!\nI've got deliveries to make!
What? You want me to deliver you\nsomewhere, too?\c
All the delivering I do every day...\nI've got deep muscle pain!\c
It was me who put up the buildings\naround these parts.
So, what do you think?\nCool stuff, huh?\c
My dream is to make a building taller\nthan a mountain!\c
Smell that? That's the smell of hay\nclinging to my body.
Whoa!\c
This smell I have is the sweet scent\nof hay that Pokémon surely love.\c
All right, take a run at me!\nMy barrel chest can take it!
What? That's all you've got?\nYou can take a harder run at me!\c
Ooh... Ow... That hurt... It's like\nyou broke my barrel chest...\c
I'm not getting any younger.\nI can't overexert myself.
What I lack in youth, I make up for\nin experience.\c
Oh, you're good and young.\nThere's a sparkle about you.\c
Hey! You there, Trainer!\nYou and me, we're battling!
Owned!\c
Unbelievable!\c
These here are my Pokémon.\nI raised them with my ma and pa.
Sure right kind of tough, aren't\nthey?\c
Well, I'll be!\nWe lost that one!\c
I'm going to do my level best.\nYou'd better keep up!
Whew! We sure did our best!\c
Yup! We tried hard, y'all!\c
OK, everyone!\nBig smiles!
Big smiles!\nCome on!\c
That's a great smile! Your victory\npose is picture perfect, too!\c
Zoom in on you!
Spot-on focus!\c
Zoom out, fade...\c
This camera is pretty hefty, actually.
My shoulder is always rock stiff...\nMy camera's toughened me up.\c
Oof...\nI'm feeling groggy...\c
Hello there, Trainer!\nPlease battle with me!
Thanks for your help!\c
I appreciate the lesson!\c
I'll do anything for a good news\nstory!
I'm relentless about battling, too!\c
Stop! Please, stop!\nYou'll break my mic!\c
So, the question is, what is your\nopinion of me?
“What a tough Trainer!” Is that\nwhat you're thinking?\c
I'm doing a live report on the topic\nof myself!\c
Come on!\nWe'll run! Together!
Gooooooooaaaaal!\c
Wait!\nDon't leave me behind!\c
Gear change!\nWe're attacking at top speed!
Vrooooom!\c
Kaboom!\c
Can you keep up with my Pokémon at\na full run?
Too slow!\c
I'm taking it to a zone beyond\nspeed!\c
I'd rather cycle casually than go\nfull speed.
Let's take it easy.\c
You ought to take things more\ncasually...\c
I only know how to go at full power,\neven against a younger opponent!
Full power is how I win!\c
Please! Let me call you Master\nTrainer from now on!\c
My spirit burns, my fists are steel,\nand my sweat cascades!
Hrrumph!\c
I sweated more. That makes\nme the victor!\c
En garde!
I'm still ready for more.\c
Urgh... Don't you forget this!\c
Hey! Come on!
Nice fight!\c
You're not bad, you.\c
The ultimate of my technique!\nExperience it in its entirety!
I am the greatest!\nGwahahaha!\c
I've fallen in defeat?\nGw-gwaaah!\c
Hi! Little kid!\nA battle, please!
Little kid!\nThank you very kindly!\c
Little kid!\nI'm really upset over this!\c
I, um... I've never actually learned\nhow to do karate.
You're kidding?!\nI'm naturally talented?!\c
A Black Belt is cool, huh?\nSo I just dress up like one.\c
It's been five years since I took to\nthe mountains. My hair's grown wild!
I bathe every day!\nHow dare you?\c
Another five years...?\c
Did I catch you smirking at my\neight-pack abs?
You don't appreciate the beauty of\npure muscles!\c
Musculature is the ultimate beauty!\c
In love and in battles, I've never\ntasted defeat!
See? We won again!\c
So, I lost. I don't care!\nI have a date soon, so I don't care!\c
This is it! Over the top!\nEveryone charge!
The enemy Trainer has fallen!\nVictory is ours!\c
Retreat!\nSound the retreat!\c
My career as a Trainer dates back\n75 years. You think you can win?
Here's a toast to my history!\c
My history of glory...\c
Are you prepared?
Ah, a superb battle that was.\c
I tip my hat to you.\c
Oh, my...\nSuch an adorable Trainer...
Are we disappointed?\nHow adorable...\c
I see...\nYou're more than simply adorable.\c
Eee-yeah!
A stirring shout, wouldn't you say?\nI find it quite bracing.
Gasp... Gasp...\nOh, dear... I'm worn out.\c
Being rich doesn't shield me from\nhaving worries...
Of course, being well off is much\npreferable to poverty, but...\c
Lavish parties day after day...\nIt gets rather tiresome, I must say.\c
Come to know defeat...\nLearn what it means to battle...
I see you becoming ever more\npowerful...\c
The defeated merely slink away...\c
Look into my eyes!
You fell under my spell!\c
My power of suggestion failed to\ncharm you!\c
...
...Did it.\c
I focused my mind in silence...\c
My powers!\nThere's no trickery about them!
This is psychic power!\c
There really is no trickery...\c
Take it all!
Ahaha!\c
Gah!\c
Close your eyes and count...\nSlow... Slower...
That was the countdown to my\nvictory!\c
Tch...\nI thought I could lull you to sleep.\c
I live among Pokémon.
I've never been much of a battler,\nbut...\c
I'm just not much of a battler.\c
...They're Pokémon I've raised with\nmy father...
...Dad, are you seeing this?\nI did it...\c
Dad, I can't...\nI need to raise them some more...\c
Raising Pokémon takes a lot of\nhonest effort!
Yahaha! I've had a hands-on time\nraising those Pokémon!\c
Urgwah!\nLook what you've done to my Pokémon!\c
Will you have a look at the Pokémon\nI've raised?
Well?\nCute, aren't they?\c
Cut a girl some slack!\c
I specialize in raising cute Pokémon!
Cute, yet strong! Right?\c
Oh, but they're so cute!\c
Nice to meet you!\nUnderestimate me at your peril!
Told you!\c
I guess I underestimated you...\c
Hmhm... I must say I like the look\nin your eyes.
Your eyes remain unclouded in defeat.\nLike jewels they are!\c
Your eyes shine brighter than any\nbig gemstone I keep at home!\c
When I was your age, I was quite\nthe daredevil, I must say.
Seeing you reminds me of my own wild\nyouth.\c
I daresay, you're quite the daredevil\nyourself!\c
If you want to run home to mommy,\nhere's you chance, punk!
Geheheh!\c
Waah!\nI want my mommy!\c
Battles achieve nothing!\nTake my hand! It's about love!
I didn't mean to battle--but take my\nhand! It's about love!\c
Battling is futile!\nTake my hand! It's about love!\c
I dropped my glasses.\nI can't see straight.
I guess I won.\nI can't see enough to tell.\c
I guess I lost.\nI can't see enough to tell.\c
Steadily and surely.\nYou build from the little things up.
Steadily and surely is how I won!\c
But I did things steadily and\nsurely...\c
Hehehehe...
Gehahahaha!\c
Sob, sob, sob...\c
Everybody gather around for my\nstupendicular Pokémon show!
Wasn't that amusing?\c
Nrrgh...\nI am not amused.\c
I shall train with you.
Show some spine!\nOn your feet!\c
Fine!\nThat will do!\c
Why get all intellectual about things?\nIf it's fun, why question it?
See, I can still win.\nI don't see a problem!\c
So I lost!\nIf it's fun, it's cool!\c
I expect you to be good...\nDon't you disappoint me!
My hope was misplaced...\c
You've got good things.\c
My papa and mama are high-skill\nTrainers, too.
It's in my lineage!\c
Papa, Mama!\nI'm so sorry!\c
I go all out in battle, no matter\nwhat.
The inevitable conclusion!\c
I concede!\c
This is it! The biggest battle in my\nlife! I cannot afford to lose!
Woot, yeah!\c
This sets me back to being a Lass...\c
My love of nature and Pokémon made\na Ranger out of me!
I love to battle, too!\c
Ooh...\nI still love to battle, too.\c
Hi! Have you ever considered a\ncareer as a Ranger?
Well, you might not make it at your\nskill level.\c
Yes, you've got the mettle.\nBeing a Ranger is a lot of fun!\c
Win or lose, a battle happens only\nonce!
Do you have any regrets?\c
I have no regrets!\c
It's my sworn duty to protect nature\nand the Pokémon in it.
It's a challenging life, but there's\na lot to enjoy every day.\c
It's a rewarding career.\nHow does it sound to you?\c
My darling Pokémon will lay a licking\non you!
Well? Satisfied?\c
Well, aren't you tough?\nI'm a little stunned!\c
I didn't sleep while trying to come\nup with this new strategy!
My strategy worked!\c
Oh, but...\nI really needed to sleep tonight...\c
The credo of the Dragon Tamer!\nNumber one!
In victory, roar!\nRoar with your dragon!\c
Even in defeat, roar!\nRoar with your dragon!\c
Mighty! Like a dragon!
Strong, I am!\c
...Urf...\nI wanted to be strong...\c
See it! Feel it!\nThe ultimate power... Probably!
There is no defeat for me, the\nultimate... Probably!\c
The title of the ultimate probably!\nI confer it on you!\c
Oh, wow!\nRare Pokémon!
Hihihi... That's what you get for\nletting down your guard.\c
Tch.\nCouldn't fool you.\c
I can't stand getting cold, but I'm\nquite good.
Ch-chatter...\nWa-wahaha. I won, I won!\c
Ch-chatter... Urr...\nI'm getting sleepy...\c
My ace Pokémon are on the go!
You surprise me!\nNot too shabby!\c
I like the sense you show!\c
Snow is wonderful!\nEverything becomes white.
Snow is so romantic!\c
I'm whiting out...\c
Don't you think this coat is cute?\nIt limits my movements, though.
It's toasty warm.\c
I feel snowed under...\c
I'm the one! Number one out of all\nthe kids in shorts!
See? That's what being number one\nis about!\c
Darn...\nI'm number one...\c
I'm the one! The only one true one\namong shorts-wearing kids!
See? That's what being the only one\nis about!\c
Darn...\nI'm the only one...\c
Um...\nI'm pleased to meet you.
Awawa... We won?\nUm? S-sorry.\c
Er, um...\nTh-thank you...\c
Here goes!
Bravo!\c
Yelp!\c
You learn too!
The harsh realities of battling!\c
The joy of victory!\c
Allow me to study you.
You offered me nothing new to learn.\c
I get it now. In that situation,\nI should have used that move.\c
My teacher gave me advice on\nbattling.
My teacher was right!\nThat was just so easy!\c
Aww, my teacher was wrong!\nNone of it worked!\c
Why are we battling?\nI don't get it.
Why? I don't understand.\c
Why did you win?\nWhat happens now?\c
Ultimately, Pokémon is just another\nbrand. You know who'll win, right?
I'm not interested in what was an\ninevitable result.\c
But how... My...\nThe Pokémon I've raised...\c
There isn't anything that I can't\nbuy. Money can buy battles!
There's nothing that money can't\nbuy.\c
I'll give you my allowance if you'll\nlet me win.\c
You know, I'm really not cut out for\ndoing this socialite-lady thing...
Gahahahah!\c
You swine! Now I'm steamed!\c
I'll be done with you lickety-split!
Lickety-split is how you were done!\c
Lickety-split is how I'll excuse\nmyself!\c
Crunch-crunch...\nCrunch-crunch...
I love these crunchy Lava Cookies...\c
What am I standing on?\nBusted Poké Balls?\c
The way of the Bug Catcher!\nBear witness to it!
This is the way of the Bug Catcher!\c
All hail Bug Catchers!\c
Feast your eyes on secret techniques\nof the ancients!
See? What did you think?\nAre you awestruck?\c
That's my cue to disappear in a puff\nof smoke.\c
I see it!
Think not ill of me...\c
Gyoeeeh!\c
Pikaaa!
Pikapikaaah!\c
Pi pika...\c
A battle, you say?\nI'm never losing to you!
Yeehah! Yippee!\nI won, I won!\c
Urk...\nWe lost...\c
It's my job to be cute!
Just being cute is money in the bank!\c
Ugagaah!\nYou rotten thief!\c
You can shake hands with me!\nIt would be quite the honor for you!
If you'd won, I would have even\ngiven you my autograph!\c
My management team will have\nsomething to say about this!\c
Run!\nDon't think! Run!
Faster!\nMore! More! Faster!\c
Run!\nKeep running for me!\c
Hiya.\nNice to meet ya.
All right.\nNice seeing ya.\c
All right.\nThanks for coming by.\c
My cohorts call me the emperor of\nfishing!
I landed another big one today!\c
Why the emperor of fishing?\nIt's an ancient Chinese legend...\c
When you get as good as me, you can\nwin easily, even if asleep.
Zzz... Zzz...\c
Sssnore...\c
My mom and I travel around in search\nof lost treasures.
The rest of the time, we fish and\ntend to crops every single day.\c
You sure seem to be hectic.\c
Win! That's what I'll do again today!\nI'll win tomorrow, too!
Nahaha! Nahaha!\nI'm not gonna lose my whole life!\c
Nooooo! No way!\nI didn't lose!\c
Allow me to examine your prowess as\na collector.
You're still wanting.\nI urge you to keep at it.\c
That's quite the collection.\nI'm willing to relieve you of the lot.\c
There! There! And there!
Yes, sir!\c
Owowowoooh!\c
I want you to hear it!\nA shout from the heart!
I love music!\c
Let's hear it for an encore!\c
Battle?\nI'm up for that.
Wow.\nGood stuff.\c
Thanks much.\c
Fwoom!
Flap! Flap!\c
I'm gonna pluck you for that!\c
Sure, let's duke it out!
Let's battle again!\c
You're not half bad!\c
Looking out over the sea's breaking\nwaves... It revives memories.
Wroaaaaaar!\nDaddy!\c
Wroaaaar!\nMommy!\c
Come on! Take a run at me!\nI can take it!
So, what'd you think?\nI was too burly for you to handle?\c
Good job!\nWay to overcome my size!\c
Waah! Wait! Wait a second!\nMy mind's not into this yet!
Hunh? It's over already?\nWhat? I won, you say?\c
Huh? Hah? It's over already?\nWhat? I lost, you say?\c
My favorite drink is Moomoo Milk.\nGot some?
Wahaha! I get the win!\nLet's celebrate over some Moomoo Milk!\c
Gwaah! Moomoo Milk!\nBring me some Moomoo Milk!\c
You're under arrest!\nYou're under arrest!
Takedown!\c
Officer down!\c
I'm not a real Policeman.\nI'm a uniform collector.
You look like a uniform will suit you.\nYou should try to find one you like.\c
I must say, battling is a wonderful\nthing.\c
Who knows what happens tomorrow?
You can lose one day, and win the\nnext. That's how it goes.\c
I might win tomorrow.\nThat's what I believe.\c
I'm throwing my all into this match!
Yeah! Yahoo!\c
It's over!\c
The indefatigable Camper makes his\nstand!
You can become a devotee if you'd\nlike.\c
I wish I could become your devotee.\c
I don't think I have any chance of\nwinning, but sure, I'll battle.
Wow, I wasn't expecting to win.\c
I knew I'd lose.\nI'm so sorry for this.\c
I think you're awfully interested in\nme, aren't you?
You lost because you were paying too\nmuch attention to me.\c
Why did you win?\nI thought you liked me.\c
Win or lose, let's not bear any\ngrudges.
Yay, yay, yay!\nWe did it!\c
Oh, you!\nDon't ever forget this!\c
Pokémon are for adults, too...\nLet me show you...
What do you think?\nAm I deep like an old blues man?\c
Though it cuts me deep, it's a man's\nlot in life to endure the pain...\c
What I have here isn't really a\nguitar.
Beep, boop, bzzt...\c
This here is a keyboard synth.\c
For work, I sometimes get to be a\nSwimmer or a Beauty.
An Idol can become anybody!\c
But the real me...\nI'm still a Lass in a miniskirt!\c
Let's enjoy ourselves.\nI hate anything to do with pain!
Ooh! That was fun!\c
Yowch! Watch it!\nYou play too rough!\c
I'll put an end to this!\nWith my favorite Pokémon!
The love I have for my Pokémon is\ncomplete and perfectly strong...\c
Why? Why?!\nWhy did I lose?!\c
Living with Pokémon...\nEvery day is the greatest.
Ehehe...\nPokémon are the best...\c
It's not a problem if I lose.\nI still have my Pokémon...\c
I have my Pokémon.\nI don't need anything else.
With my Pokémon, I can be happy\nevery day.\c
Isn't that the same for you?\nIsn't it?\c
You won't guess it now, but I was\nquite the party girl in my day.
Well, I still have it now, you know.\c
I feel nostalgic for those days...\c
Do your best!\nMy beloved children!
Wahaha! Well done!\nMama's proud of you!\c
My Pokémon are my beloved family.\c
Little boy? Little girl? Doesn't\nmatter which. Let's do this!
Little boy? Little girl?\nDoesn't matter which, but sorry.\c
Little boy? Little girl? Doesn't\nmatter which, but you're sure tough!\c
Your ride ends here.
Told ya it's over.\c
Too much for me to handle!\c
We're going for the win!\nHey-ho, let's go!
Yay! Vavavoom!\c
Aww, we lost...\nSniffle...\c
Let me introduce to you\nmy cherished partners!
How did you find them?\nMy cherished partners.\c
Awawa...\nMy partners...\c
Winning and losing isn't all there is\nto battling.
Well, sure, it makes me happy when\nI win.\c
The effort you put in is what's\nimportant.\c
It's no good to be too harsh...\nBut pampering is also out...
Being a Pokémon Breeder is a deep\nand complex challenge.\c
Balance is key for raising good\nPokémon.\c
I'll check how your Pokémon have\ngrown for you.
Not good enough!\nYour training style's not up to par.\c
This is impressive! You've raised your\nPokémon really thoroughly.\c
I'll win.\nNo lie.
See?\c
Huh!\c
Fwaah! Fwaah!\nYou think you can beat me?
Fwaah! Fwaah!\nI win!\c
Fwaah!\c
I've caught you now.\nGive up.
You weren't bad.\nLet's meet again.\c
How could this be...?\c
Yo, yo!\nLet's have a fun time!
Thank you!\nLet's play again!\c
Thanks!\nPlay with me again!\c
You're no good at all.\nI'd better teach you.
No, no, this won't do at all.\nUp on your feet. Never give up!\c
You've got good skills.\nYou tried hard, too. Excellent!\c
I'm jacking up the power to max!\nAll the way to eleven!
Ooh, yeah! I'm feeling electric!\c
Eeyow! I got zapped!\c
OK, bring it!
Hah! Too weak!\nKeep trying!\c
Hoh! You are tough!\nGive me a rematch!\c
You need to be serious with me!
Oh? That's it?\c
OK...\nQuite remarkable...\c
Ahaha! Too bad for you!\nI'm your opponent!
Ahaha!\c
Aha...\nAhaha...\c
Are you nervous?\nLeave it to the dude!
That was a good battle.\nI hope we can meet again.\c
Whew...\nThe dude wasn't expecting to lose.\c
The power of nature!\nLet me show you!
This is the power of nature!\c
Protect the natural environment...
A battle with me? I don't know what\nyou're talking about.
See?\nI thought this would happen.\c
Boo! Boo!\nThis is not right!\c
Fuhahaha!\nYour next challenge is me!
Fuhahaha! You seriously believed you\ncould defeat me?\c
Fuhahaha!\nLet us meet again!\c
Off you go! Face my team of totally\ntrained Pokémon!
Bravo!\nI knew my Pokémon would do it!\c
Oh, no! That's awful!\nWhat have you done to my Pokémon?!\c
A battle is deadly earnest!\nNot a moment of inattention!
Never let down your guard!\c
I seemed to have let my mind\nwander...\c
Hey!
Heeey!\c
Hey...\c
I'm tough, that's all.
I won, that's all.\c
I lost, that's all.\c
Shaah!
Hwooh!\c
Hawah!\c
I've been here for years, but I never\nget tired of this.
You might not think so, but I'm still\na kid. I'm in the same grade as you.\c
I'd like to keep battling Pokémon\neven when my hair is gray.\c
Let me make one thing clear...\nYou aren't capable of beating me.
Did I not say? There is no possible\nchance of you beating me.\c
How could this be...? Only that girl with\nthe inflatable tube has beaten me...\c
Oh, my, a mere child.
Children these days...\nSo careless.\c
Children these days...\nQuite exuberant, methinks.\c
I would like my children to become\nstrong and distinguished Trainers.
It wouldn't do if my children were\nonly as good as you...\c
It would be nice if they were as\nskilled as you...\c
Behold you shall!\nPsychic-mystifying power!
You see?\nPsychic-mystifying power!\c
No, but...\nPsychic-mystifying power...\c
My family will show you a good time!
Hold up, my family!\nThat'll be enough already!\c
My beloved family...\c
Twirl, twirl, twirl...
Are you feeling dizzy?\c
Ooorgh...\nMy head's spinning...\c
My big brother told me!\nEyes! Aim for the eyes!
Yay! I did it!\nMy big brother's plan worked!
My big brother told me to lower\nthe foe's accuracy!
Hoy! You look pretty tough.\nThis is gonna be fun!
I thought so!\nYou are tough!\c
Yup, you sure are tough.\nKeep it up!\c
Ah, welcome!\nI'm your server today!
Would you care to settle your bill?\c
Thank you so much!\c
Hello.\nWhatcha having?
Thanks a million!\c
Be seeing ya!\c
I love cute customers like you!\nI'll serve you right!
Well, were you happy with the way\nI served you?\c
Oh, but...\nI'm not done serving you.\c
Stare...
You've got something on your nose.\c
You're cool, all right.\nI had to stare.\c
I've waited a long time for a Trainer\nlike you to come along.
Yup, you're as tough as I thought.\nYou even had me in trouble!\c
I knew it!\nYou are a tough Trainer!\c
Now how should I conduct this\noffensive?
Oh, now I need a better effort out\nof you than that.\c
Oh, you're finished and content?\nOK, another time, then.\c
My Pokémon have a different taste\nfrom the usual bunch.
Did you notice the difference?\nMy party has rich depth.\c
Did you notice the difference?\nMy party is refreshingly dry.\c
Hiya!\nTough-looking Trainer, aren't you!
This feeling of elation is bubbling\nup in me!\c
Ooch...\nYou're too much to handle.\c
Varrroooom!\nWatch me go full throttle!
Vavavaroooom!\nI'm not close to redlining!\c
Vrrr... Vrruuu...\nI'm flat out of gas...\c
Jingle, jingle!
Skreeeech!\c
Thud!\c
It's my dream to cycle with my\nboyfriend.
No riding double, though!\c
I wish I had a boyfriend!\c
What's your motive?\nWhat brought you here?
You lose.\nNow what will you do?\c
Play it again.\c
We'll keep this match dry.
I admire your technique.\c
I remain humbled...\c
You're serious? A battle?\nAnd that's against me?
Cackle!\nYou shouldn't have tried!\c
Double wow!\c
I'll dance and sing and rivet your\nattention!
Ooh, baby!\c
So much for riveting your attention.\nYou nailed my Pokémon!\c
Ready, start!
First across the finish line!\c
Waah! Wait for me!\c
Can you explain why I'm here?
I mean, who are you?\c
Why am I battling here?\c
My fishing-rod-handling technique is\nthe best in all Sinnoh. Check it out!
See it?\nSurprised, I bet!\c
How I handle my fishing rod has\nnothing to do with battling...\c
The two loves of my life are fishing\nand battling.
I feel fantastic when I land a big\nfish or win a big battle.\c
I was born to fish and battle!\c
I come here on a ship.\nBig ship it was.
Sinnoh, I like.\nVery nice place.\c
You want go to sea? My ship, we will\nsee wonderful things.\c
Huh? You're my opponent?\nThis is kind of unnerving...
I'm surprised...\nI didn't think I'd win.\c
See, I told you...\nI thought you were tough.\c
Hahah! Howdy!
Hahah! Keep it coming!\c
Thanks for your time!\c
Let's be good sports about this!\nBig smile!
Ahaha! Ahaha!\nCome on, you laugh too!\c
I'm cheerful even in defeat!\nAhaha! Ahaha!\c
Buck up.
Not bad.\c
You're good.\c
The sweetest thing about battling?\nThe finishing blow!
Take that!\nThat's my finishing move!\c
Oof...\nI feel your final shots...\c
Hey, you're looking nifty!
Hey, you tried, right?\c
Hey, you're kind of tough.\c
Listen! This is my chorus group.\nMe and my Pokémon!
Shooby-dooby doowop!\c
Oh, wait!\nWe're not done singing!\c
I got tips from my online friends on\nhow to best raise my gang.
I must thank my online friends.\nI don't know who they are, though.\c
Well, this blows!\nMy online buddies let me down!\c
Can I have a moment?\nI'm trying to write some email.
I need to get home quick and check\non my email.\c
What do you think you're doing?\nI want to go already.\c
Father... Mother...\nPlease watch over me...
Father... Mother...\nWere you watching...?\c
Father... Mother...\nPlease forgive me...\c
Can't rightly say I much like\nbattling, I tell you.
I won, but...\nI'm still shaking...\c
Grr...\nI'm so angry I could cry...\c
It's the power of science!
Did you see? Were you amazed?\nThat's the power of science!\c
It's inconceivable... How could the\npower of science be defeated?\c
Charge, my Pokémon! Demonstrate the\nfruits of our experimentation!
Yes, my Pokémon proved my theory!\nI'll get my professorship now!\c
What kind of experiments?\nThat's classified.
I shall regress to my childhood for\nthis battle.
Googoo gagga.\c
Gagga...\c
Fwahahaha!\nYou've come a long way!
Fwahahahaha!\c
Fwahahaha!\nYou're blessed to have your friends!\c
I'll scrap you.
I'll recycle you.\c
Think ecology. Think green.\c
Why, sure! Sounds great!\nWe have to do this!
Bam! All done!\c
A battle while working...\nIt's a good way to take a break.\c
I'll try to do my best!\nPlease give me this chance!
I've done it!\nI've achieved my goal!\c
I tried the best I could!\nThank you for your encouragement!\c
A battle is... It is a love letter\nwritten in sand.
Did you understand what I'm trying\nto say? I guess you wouldn't.\c
Did you understand what I'm trying\nto say? I guess you wouldn't.\c
Hello, you there! Yes, you!\nHold up. Hold it, I say!
OK, kids shouldn't be out now.\nGo home, and be quick about it.\c
You shouldn't mess with a police\nofficer like that.\c
Sssnork... Zzz...
CLEFAIRY... Mumble...\nWait for me... Sssnork...\c
Mutter...\nEhehe... Ssssnore...\c
Let's keep this elegant!
Mmm, yes!\c
You're quite the Trainer yourself!\c
A battle isn't something you can\ncalculate.
What'd I tell you?\nYou win when you win.\c
What'd I say, huh?\nYou lose when you lose.\c
There's lots in life that doesn't\ngo the way you want.
Yippee!\nThings went my way!\c
See...?\c
There's nowhere to run or hide!
This was a foregone conclusion!\c
Farewell!\c
I wait for tough Trainers here,\ncome rain or shine.
Because of that, I've grown so very\nstrong...\c
Won't a tough... No, forget that.\nI need a cool Trainer to come...\c
This is for keeping the sun off.
I'm strong at battling, but I can't\ntake sunlight...\c
I don't want to roast my skin.\c
Well...\nThose are rare Pokémon...
I've never caught those...\nYour Pokémon are different, all right.\c
Oh, you're a Trainer?\nYou're not a Pokémon?\c
Ready?
Cool.\c
Bye.\c
Beat me?\nTry again in another ten years!
No spine!\c
You're tough!\nYou inspire me!\c
Smelling sweet scents makes me so\ndrowsy...
...Yawn...\nOh? Are we finished so soon?\c
...Yawn...\nOh, really? I lost?\c
You're sure you can handle me?\nI'm an ultrastellar talent.
Don't feel bad!\nI'm an ultrastellar talent!\c
You're in the miracle-star class!\c
I live only for battles.\nOnly victories give me hope.
...Naturally.\c
Who are you...?\c
   
    
    
   
    
    
   
    
    
   
    
    
   
    
    
Now come! Show me, the Tower Tycoon,\nwhat you're really made of!
A magnificent bout that was!\nDo come visit again!\c
Losing to an outstanding Trainer like\nyou... I can live with that.\c
Now come! Show me, the Tower Tycoon,\nwhat you're really made of!
A magnificent bout that was!\nDo come visit again!\c
Losing to an outstanding Trainer like\nyou... I can live with that.\c

And we're off!
We did it, yeah!\c
Uncle!\c
My Pokémon are a cut apart from the\nusual. Maybe even two cuts!
Their cutting intensity and solid\nattack... Top class, yeah?\c
Grr...\nRendered harmless...\c
The prince among shorts-wearing\nYoungsters, that is me!
I hope I lived up to my title of the\nprince among the shorts wearers.\c
I can't lose here! Not as the prince\namong the wearers of shorts!\c
I can't bear this tension.\nWould they be mad if I went home?
I did it!\nI won somehow!\c
That's gone past my limit!\nI need to be excused!\c
I'm not very good at this, but please\ndon't hold back.
Oh, didn't I say?\nYou shouldn't have held back.\c
Fweh! I wish you would have held back a\nlittle bit!\c
In romance, fashion, and Pokémon!\nToday's girls want it all!
The greed of today's girls knows no\nbounds!\c
Did being greedy end up costing me\neverything?\c
I'm thinking hard about why everyone\nlikes battling so much.
Why does winning a battle make people\nhappy?\c
Why is losing a battle so downright\ninfuriating?\c
I'm trying to keep up with my Pokémon\ntraining and my own schooling.
I'd like to think I've struck the right\nbalance of fun and education.\c
This isn't going to work?\nMy grades are the best in class, but...\c
I crammed hard for this.\nI can't possibly fail!
Yes! I get the win!\nI'm glad I kept with this!\c
It means I need to study at home some\nmore.\c
My Pokémon are my treasures.\nI'll let you see them. Just you.
See? Cute and strong!\nEheheheh.\c
See? They're cute even when losing.\nEheheheh.\c
I won't lose ever!\nPlease abide by my rule!
Thank you so much!\nI owe this win to you!\c
I so did not want to lose...\c
I can do this...\nI can shine here, too!
Yes! I won!\nI'm going to be a star!\c
One day, I'm going to shine as the\nbrightest star in the world!\c
Don't be shy.\nYou can bring it any which way.
Yeah, I figured you'd be like this.\nHeh.\c
W-well, sometimes I have to lose, just\nso I don't crush everyone. Ahaha...\c
My father's wealthy.\nThere's nothing he can't afford.
My father's money bought my Pokémon.\c
There are things that money can't buy.\nI know that...\c
Well, shall we?\nTime is money, and the meter is running.
Well, I'll take my leave. Yet another\nfancy dinner date, you know. Adieu!\c
It's my loss, is it? So be it.\nI had to leave for a date anyway.\c
Uphold the rules of etiquette and\ncourtesy... That's what a lady does.
If I couldn't unwind this way, I would\nlose my ladylike composure.\c
I wish I could be free like the bird\nPokémon in the skies...\c
If I were Honey, then you would be\nGooey Mulch, I would think.
Do you see now?\nHow different we are in level and class?\c
How dare you!\nI won't forget this humiliation ever!\c
Partying, shopping, dining...\nDarling, I've grown bored of it all.
Excitement is so lacking in my life.\nWhat will send my heart racing?\c
Only battling lifts me from this idle\nexistence of boredom and apathy...\c
I'm glad to make your acquaintance!\nMay this friendship be fruitful!
Thank you very much!\nThank you so very much!\c
Thank you very much...\n...Pah.\c
The most natural Trainer is...\nOh, why hide it? None other than me!
This is the natural outcome.\nIt was inevitable!\c
I was battling naturally, and ended up\nwith the loss.\c
Yes! Not a grown-up!\nLucky me! I stand a chance!
Yup, battling another kid is a lot less\nscary.\c
I get really nervous in front of\ngrown-ups.\c
It's hard to keep the streak alive,\nbut the battles are fun.
It's more fun to win, of course!\c
Even losing is fun.\nIt's the wonder of Pokémon!\c
My daddy is a real mountain man. Does\nthat make my mom a mountain woman?
Mountain woman sounds icky.\nNot for me, thank you!\c
I'm their daughter. Is a mountain\nwoman my destiny?\c
I have a pack lunch all ready, and of\ncourse I have some snacks.
My favorite Pokémon make winning so\neasy!\c
Oh, no, no! I forgot to bring my\nfavorite Pokémon!\c
I frolic with my water Pokémon in a pool\nall the time.
It sure makes me happy winning with my\nPokémon favorites.\c
I'd love to swim in a pool full of water\nPokémon.\c
I promised Mommy I'll practice swimming\nif I lose.
Yay! I won't have to go to the pool\nwith Mommy today!\c
Aww, I lost. Now I'll have to go to\nswimming practice today.\c
I went and caught my Pokémon with my\ndaddy.
I won, Daddy!\nDaddy, thank you!\c
I wonder if Daddy will show me how to\ntrain my Pokémon next?\c
I'm on the way home from the pool, but\nOK, I can battle.
I hope I can go home soon.\nI need some dry clothes!\c
Ah-ah-atchoo! Aww...\nAtchoo! We lost...\c
I'm the captain of a heroic vessel\namong the crashing waves of a storm!
Made it to shore with the ease of a\nreal swashbuckler!\c
That was a bigger crash than I wanted!\c
I just now got back from my vacation.
The beach is a good place to show off.\c
Ooh, my sunburn is itching.\c
Hunh? A battle, is that it?\nSure thing, sure thing.
Hey, you're something special, huh?\c
Yeah, thanks for your time.\c
This is going out to all the ladies.\nBabes, I sing and battle for you!
My ladies, my babes, I won for you.\nYour love is my power, right?\c
I lost, but my love for the babes can't\nbe beat, maybe.\c
This is no guitar I have here.\nIt's traditional and Japanese.
It has only three strings.\nCan you tell what this is?\c
My instrument, it's called a shamisen.\c
We teen Idols have a secret code\nof conduct that's strictly enforced.
For example, if an Idol wins, she has\nto squeal and jump around.\c
If an Idol loses, she must never act\nangry. That's a big no-no.\c
Do the monster Meteor Mash!\nIt's my catchphrase!
My Meteor Mash goes to your heart!\c
All Idols need a catchphrase,\nespecially right after their debut.\c
You're ever so lucky to get the chance\nto battle with me.
You're super lucky to even battle\nan Idol like me. Don't you get it?\c
Huh? Huh? Now, why did you win?\nYou know I'm supposed to win?\c
Krink... Krak... Heheheh.\nLet me limber up for this.
Hah!\nWeak, even for a joke!\c
Gnnrrr...\nI have only myself to blame...\c
Aren't they pretty? Adorable?\nThey're my beloved Pokémon.
You worked so hard! I'll give you a nice\nmassage at home.\c
What are you doing to my Pokémon?!\nWhat if you hurt them?!\c
I come before you as a member of the\nPokémon Fan Club! En garde!
Long live the Pokémon Fan Club!\nMay it always be glorious!\c
This is hardly a taste of what the\nPokémon Fan Club can bring down...\c
Fan Club Department Manager...\nI hereby accept your challenge.
Heheh... Honestly, you thought you\nstood a chance against the Fan Club?\c
Gwah! I will be avenged...\nB-by the Division Manager...\c
Raising Pokémon with love isn't the same\nas coddling them. Don't you see?
Ooh, you did it! Oh, I love you so!\nMy luvly, wuvly Pokémon!\c
How could you?!\nWhat if my Pokémon are injured?!\c
On behalf of my village, I take on this\nchallenge!
Thank you, everyone!\nThank you for your vocal support!\c
Fellow villagers, I'm sorry!\nMy best wasn't enough!\c
Thank you for your patience.\nHere is the battle you'd ordered.
I trust you were satisfied?\nI feel shortchanged somewhat.\c
I trust you were satisfied?\nI've had my fill.\c
Work is fun, and Pokémon also.\nI am happy I come to this country.
Having fun I am!\nI hoping to live here forever.\c
Oh, why you beat me? So mean!\nI want go home to my country.\c
I'm cool, right? So, everywhere I work,\nthey make me the maitre d'...
I'm a good battler, too. I can't help it\nthat the ladies fall for me.\c
I dream of evolving from a maitre d' to\na celebrity chef.\c
There are no free deals on a battle.\nYou'll get the full course, though.
Where's the fun if you don't battle\nlike you mean it?\c
I take work and play seriously.\nThat's what sparks my passion!\c
Hi, may I interest you in a meal combo?\n...I'm so used to saying that at work!
Thank you, and have a great day!\n...What am I saying?\c
We look forward to your next visit!\n...What am I thinking?\c
Your team looks impressive.\nWill I be OK...?
Oh, what?\nAre those Pokémon only for Contests?\c
Ouch! I said ouch!\nIt was too much! Way, way too much!\c
I love bug Pokémon!\nI love my bug net even more!
I caught my Pokémon using my trusty\nbug net.\c
It'd be cool if there was a bug net\nPokémon.\c
The bugs are my minions, and I'm the\nboss. Are you prepared to lose?
Wahaha!\nWell done, my minions!\c
We were mowed down...\nMy minions have learned the hard way!\c
I'm breaking out of my shell!\nI'm taking it to the next level!
It's like I've sprouted wings!\nViva to the new me!\c
Is it not my time yet?\nDo I need to stay in my shell longer?\c
You transgressor!\nHold still, I say!
I willed myself to victory!\c
C-curses...\nI've brought dishonor on us...\c
Hey, hey, what's that over there?\nIt's... It's a legendary Pokémon!
Kekeke... Ninjutsu misdirection!\nIt worked to perfection!\c
Ninjutsu misdirection was a failure!\nI'll disappear in a puff of smoke!\c
You'll be befuddled by my dazzling\nspeed!
Your movements...\nIt's as if you're moving in molasses.\c
I didn't need to do all that dashing\naround, did I?\c
I've been wearing these clothes for a\nlong time. Bathing is for the birds!
Changing clothes takes too much effort.\nTaking a bath is even worse!\c
No, no, no!\nI won't take a bath!\c
I like my mommy, PIKACHU, and my daddy,\ntoo.
A weak Trainer isn't cool.\nI don't like you.\c
A not-wimpy Trainer is cool.\nI like you.\c
Pikapika pikaah!\nPikka! Pikachuuuh!
Piika pikapikka!\nPikka pikkachuuh!\c
Pikka ppi pi piii...\c
When I enter battle, I picture the vast\nsea in my mind.
When I can envision the sea, I feel as if\nI could never lose.\c
When I envision the sea, I don't feel\nthe sting of defeat.\c
In battle and in love, one needs to\nknow when it is best to back off.
After all, both battle and romance can\nbecome quagmires of despair.\c
I may have lost, but I said something\ndeep, in an endless bog kind of way.\c
I'm afraid I got cursed on our last\nexploration of ancient ruins. Ehehe.
Even just now, I have no idea how I won.\nHeeheehee.\c
I may be cursed, but this is fun.\nIt is all so very good. Heeheehee.\c
Seeing buildings and towns from the old\nages sends my pulse racing.
People interested in old architecture\nare potential Ruin Maniacs.
Open your eyes in towns. There will be\nexciting new discoveries. I mean it.
I put this team together with my\nInternet buddies. It took us all day!
We won! I need to thank my Internet\nbuddies for their advice!\c
Aww, darn it! We lost?!\nI'll report it to my Internet buddies!\c
I'm the main character of this story.\nIt's impossible for me to lose.
You're good! Though, as a supporting\ncharacter, you're a bit too strong.\c
...The hero has to suffer a bit so the\naudience feels more empathy.\c
I'm very fickle. I can't stick with any\none thing for very long.
I won, and it's enough for me.\nI'm going to check out the Wi-Fi Plaza.\c
I lost, so that's enough. I'll go dig\nSpheres in the Underground.\c
I have a ton more experience than you.\nWhat will you do about it?
Not bad, but you need more maturing.\c
Experience alone doesn't ensure any\nwins, I'm learning.\c
Don't you think Pokémon battles are a\nlot like the weather?
Winning makes me feel warm and cheerful\nlike a sunny day.\c
Losing makes me sad like a dreary,\ncloudy day.\c
I was out all night at a party again.\nI'm feeling dizzy from playing games!
I'm so bored of fancy parties and silly\ngames, too.\c
Urp...!\c
Ooh, aren't you the most darling thing!\nCan you win a smile from me?
Ooh, sweetie, I win, so no smile!\nBe sure to win next time!\c
I don't feel like smiling now...but\nI'll be happy to wave good-bye!\c
...Oh, wait one second.\nI have to take this call.
Hi, yup... Yah, battling... Uh-huh...\nYup, I won... Well, duh... LOL...\c
Hi, yup... Yes, just battled... Nope...\nKid beat me... Uh-huh...\c
Snivel! Hnurrff! Snort!\nThis hay fever is a wicked misery...
Hnurrff! Snivel! Snivel! Snivel!\nI won, but the misery continues!\c
Sniffle. Snivel. Snort.\nI'm not crying. My nose is running.\c
My acute sense of smell tells me how\ntough a Trainer is.
Keep trying. My nose tells me\nyou have great potential.\c
Sniff, sniff... Snort! My nose tells me\nyou've been working hard!\c
Kyahaha! I smell a powerful battle\nin the making!
The sweet smell of success!\c
Defeat smells like a SKUNTANK!\c
I like hard, fast beats in my battling\nand my rock 'n' roll! Let's wail!
And, bam! That rhythm pattern ruled,\nif I may say so myself!\c
Ouch! That's an insult to the ears!\nThose beats were offensive, man!\c
To show you how much this means to me,\nI'll use sound effects from now on.
Raaaah! Dun dun! Dun dun!\nOompa-oompa-oompapa!\c
Blip-bip, blip-bip... Blip... Bweeee...\c
Wait, please wait...\nThe winds... I hear them...
I can hear them...\nThe winds are laughing...\c
I can hear them...\nThe winds... They are in tears...\c
I can't fly...\nBut these babies can soar...
My spirit has been uplifted to the\nskies... Thank you, everyone...\c
You broke my wings...\nI won't ever forget you...\c
Every day, I'm like a migratory bird,\nbut I go in all cardinal directions.
I gained experience while traveling to\nall sorts of places.\c
I'd love to live somewhere where I can\nfind other Trainers like you.\c
I was born unto rolling waves that\nwashed me, with the beach, my cradle.
I was born and grew up on the seas.\nThat's what made me the big man I am.\c
I lost, did I? Time to go to the sea\nand stare inscrutably at it.
Youths of today aim for the world!\nHow's that for deep!
There'd be some mighty cool Trainers\naround the world. I'm sure of that.\c
Go on, kid! Take on the world!\nI'll look forward to your return!\c
What's that? I smell dusty?\nDon't you know the aroma of soil?
See, that's what you get!\nYour team had to eat dirt, get it?\c
Dropped in the dirt by some kid who\ndoesn't know the smell of soil!\c
Sorry for looking so scruffy and dirty.\nI've been holed up in the mountains.
I wasn't really holed up, at least not\non purpose. I was lost out there.\c
It's better to be holed up in the\nmountains than in your room, I say.\c
I'm not supposed to be here.\nCan we do this on the sly?
Even battling can draw attention.\nIt's not easy being a pop star.\c
Pop stars are ordinary girls at heart.\nWe want to enjoy our Pokémon, too!\c
I'm a self-made celebrity.\nDo you have a problem with that?
A celebrity is a celebrity, even if it's\nin my own mind.\c
I want to be the center of attention,\njust me and only me.\c
I'm facing retirement soon...\nI was never admired as an Idol.
I'm going to shine as a star battler of\nPokémon!\c
I would have liked to end my career\nwith a win in this match...
I think training Pokémon shares a lot of\nsimilarities with a marathon. You?
There's meaning in sticking with your\ntraining regimen every day.\c
If you don't pace yourself, you can't\nwin.\c
Howdy! Let's keep it clean, fair,\nrefreshing, and pleasant!
Whew, I feel invigorated!\nPokémon are the greatest!\c
Uh, haha...ha... It actually feels kinda\ncleansing to be thrashed this badly.\c
It's the Workers of the world like us\nwho keep the world going.
There are times we would like to lay\ndown our tools and rest.\c
Don't forget how Workers like us work\nfor you.\c
My wife and boy are waiting on me back\nhome. I can't afford to lose!
I'm sorry, but I had to do this. You'll\nget tougher with a family behind you.\c
Oh, no! How am I supposed to show my\nface around my dear wife and boy now?\c
Pokémon are like family to me.\n...Nah, they are family.
Yes! My family, you did it!\nWe knocked off that mean Trainer!\c
Fwaaaah! That's cruel!\nMy family's hurting!\c
I was too lenient with my Pokémon.\nThey grew up all selfish on me.
Hey, now, enough. Stop attacking!\nThe battle's long over already.\c
Hey, now, the battle's over and done.\nNo attacking the Trainer.\c
You, there. Don't look around now.\nPay attention to me. Focus.
Kid, you're grossly underpowered.\nYou ought to train with me.\c
Oh, yeah. You're better than you look.\nI was wrong about you, kid.\c
Go, my Pokémon.\nBut don't strain yourselves.
Oh, wow, I like how tough everyone was.\nOur Pokémon and you, yup.\c
OK, nice try, gang.\nThanks much for trying.\c
My papa's dream...\nI'm going to make it real.
Papa, did you see?\nWe did it all for you...\c
We lost...\nPapa, I am so sorry...\c
I'd like to take a break.\n...No? We have to begin right away?
Aww, see? You should have taken a\nbreak with me before.\c
Ooh, aren't you a tough one?\nYou should take breaks, though.\c
Yes, yes, looking good!\nI need a smile now. Can you do that?
No, no, no. I need a smile from you.\nLet's see those teeth sparkle!\c
Yes, that's a good smile!\nNow tilt your head toward me.\c
You probably can't tell, but I can see\nright down to your pores.
Yes, I see it, indeed.\nI can see you clearly.\c
I zoomed in on you too much.\nI couldn't see your Pokémon.\c
While battling, I'll keep looking for the\nbest shot of you.
There! And there again!\nDecisive moments in time!\c
Shots of me losing?\nThose get deleted immediately.\c
I'll be bringing you live coverage from\nmy imminent battle!
Our intrepid and beautiful Reporter has\ncarried the day! Go, me!\c
Our intrepid and beautiful Reporter has\ngone down in defeat. Take pity on me!\c
I hate admitting it, but I wanted to be\nan Idol, too.
I didn't want to lose to any Idol.\nThat motivated me to train.\c
This is crushing... I work so much\nharder than any silly Idol...\c
This microphone is what made me a star.\nIt's my all and everything.
Even for a battle, I don't let this\nmicrophone leave my hand.\c
...Thud. Bzzzzt...\c
Hey, 'sup. I should warn you, I'm right\nfast, Trainer. Hold on to your hat.
Trainer, from now on, you can start\nadding Mister to my name.\c
Trainer, that was a real learning\nexperience. Thank you, seriously.\c
This bike has become an extension of\nmy very being.
Any damage to my bike, I feel the pain\nas if it were mine to bear.\c
Please! I'll ask you to keep your filthy\nhands off my bike.\c
When I was little, I hated cycling.\nI couldn't get the hang of it.
I love cycling now.\nI've made many friends riding.\c
Can you ride a bike?\nIt's healthy and a lot of fun.\c
I'll ride toward the breaking dawn with\nyou on my mind.
I will shift my gears higher and higher\nuntil I catch up to you...\c
My tires have deflated, and\nso has my heart...\c
Let the curtains rise on the festivities\nof muscles and Pokémon!
Did you enjoy our demonstration of\nmuscle and Pokémon?\c
Though I've lost, my muscles and\nPokémon are seared into your mind.\c
They say I have fists of steel and the\nheart of a child.
Oh, yay! Yippee!\nI won, I won!\c
Oh, boo! Boo! This stinks!\nI'm not talking to you!\c
Hwoaaah...\nHwoaaah...
Howatchah!\nHowaaatchaah!\c
Fweeeh...\nFweeehhh...\c
In my dictionary, there is no entry\nfor “restraint.”
The greatest show of respect among\nTrainers is to battle all out.\c
I went all out and still lost.\nOf course it stings.\c
A professional martial artist is in\nperpetual control of his body.
A martial artist must be more than\nstrong. He must also be wise.\c
Gah! I overdid my training and ran out\nof stamina early...\c
When I close my eyes, I can picture you\nbeing defeated. Come on.
Why be sad?\nYou knew this was coming.\c
I berate myself for my own lack of\ncare...\c
I don't like to move much.\nI trained using the Net and TV.
Uhihi! I'm a naturally talented pro at\nboth karate and Pokémon, I am.\c
Oh, man, this is rotten! I'm tired and\nhungry and want to go home!\c
...To get this far, I had to make\nsacrifices. Many, many sacrifices.
It's for this one moment that I live.\c
What else do I have to give up so I can\nbeat you?\c
First, let's battle.\nTalking can wait.
That wasn't bad at all, yup.\nThat goes for you and your Pokémon.\c
You're a tough one, yup.\nWhere do you do your training?\c
Cute little Trainer!\nWe'll squash you flat.
Eheh! You're so cute when you look\nangry and frustrated!\c
What do you think you're doing?\nI hate to lose, I'll have you know!\c
My precious Pokémon will set you right!
My Pokémon have no flaws that you can\nexploit!\c
I apologize, my dear Pokémon...\nI was caught unprepared...\c
Fwo-fwo-fwo. Youngster, what's most\nimportant is to never give up.
If you give up, that's it.\nThe game's over.\c
Fwo-fwo-fwo.\nYou're an admirable Trainer already.\c
I can tell by the way you look, you're\nquite taken with my dandy style!
You shouldn't be so mesmerized by me.\nLike a MOTHIM drawn to a flame!\c
Oh, you're not interested in me?\nYou're just SHELLOS, if I say so myself.\c
Oh, hello, aren't you a sweetie!\nAre you sure you're up to this?
Oh, now, please don't cry.\nYou should be proud of yourself, dear.\c
Oh, my... You're quite the capable\npractitioner of the art.\c
You and your Pokémon could use an\nobedience lesson from me.
This isn't over until I say.\nOnce more.\c
You defy me?\nHow very amusing.\c
Over the years, I've crossed paths\nwith many a Trainer.
They were all wonderful Trainers in\ntheir own ways. All fond memories now...\c
You're one among those many Trainers.\nI'm sorry I wasn't younger.\c
I am a Psychic, though I may not look\nlike one. I'll do something psychic.
I didn't use any psychic power to win.\nNo, really.\c
Did you notice? I was levitating while I\nwas in battle with you.\c
Fwazzam!\nSo! You are my next victim!
Fwazzam!\nHave you no spine?!\c
Fwizzle...\nDon't think there will be a next time!
I can use psychic power, but I prefer\nordinary sleight-of-hand magic tricks.
It's my opinion that psychic power\nshould be left to the Pokémon.\c
I'm a Psychic, but I'm also a student\nof a magician's school.\c
In the next few minutes, you will learn\ntrue terror at my hands!
Hah! Too weak! Too weak!\nWhat pitiful resistance!\c
Noooo!\nI cannot lose!
I see what I have no right seeing...\nLike there. Behind you.
Oh? You can't see it?\nThen, you're fortunate. Giggle...\c
I wouldn't ask about what I see.\nIt's better not to know. Really.\c
The great unseeable power...\nI beseech you for help...
Oh, great unseeable power...\nI thank you for coming to my aid...\c
Oh... Great unseeable power...\nWhy have you forsaken me...\c
Why do I raise Pokémon?\nBecause they are there!
I think I said something deep and cool!\nDidn't I?\c
That's no reason at all?\nThat's the reason in itself!\c
My team has been raised with care.\nI have absolute confidence in them.
You should pay closer attention to the\nunique aspects of your Pokémon.\c
How did you find my Pokémon?\nDid you notice their significance?\c
Everyone, it's showtime!\nGet out and do some clobbering!
Oh, bravo!\nNicely won!\c
Arrgh! How humiliating!\nQuick! Out of the spotlight!\c
I love raising Pokémon.\nIt's what I live for!
Seeing them try so hard to please...\nIt's so unbearably adorable.\c
Don't you dare do that again!\c
I've been devising ways of raising tough\nPokémon from the genetic level.
You can't overlook the role of\nknowledge in raising tough Pokémon.\c
I need to study and understand what\ngenetics is about first.\c
Raise them with love, and Pokémon will\nanswer in kind. Probably.
They responded to my love.\nProbably.\c
You're raising your Pokémon with a lot\nof love. I think.\c
I believe I will approach this battle\nfrom the perspective of a newborn.
Abuboo dah.\c
Ababaa.\nManmaa.\c
If you prevail, I'll recount to you a\ntale from my youth.
Seeing you brings back a flood of\nmemories. Ah, yes, indeed...\c
...Hm?\nI seem to have forgotten...\c
There's no end to adolescence or\nPokémon.
See ya! That was fun!\nEnjoy your youth!\c
I'm still a dreamer.\nA precious, unspoiled snowflake...\c
Daddy... Mommy... Can you hear me?\nPlease watch over me...
Daddy... Mommy... Did you see?\nI won, and it's all for you...\c
Oh... Daddy... Mommy...\nI couldn't win...\c
Finally... The time has come to put the\nfruits of my research to the test...
Success...\nSacrificing my youth was worthwhile.\c
No! Nooooooo!\nGive me back my youth!\c
I developed a special Pokémon drink.\nHave some! Bottoms up!
Glug, glug... Belch!\nIt'll make you strong! Don't waste it!\c
My Pokémon drink contains no actual\nPokémon or their byproducts.\c
An analogy for battling is...\nI'd say a bachelor guy.
Heheh, do you get it?\nI doubt you'd get it. No one does.\c
Do you get what I'm saying?\nI doubt you'd get it. No one ever does.\c
Myself, I have been born, raised, and\nspent my life under a circus tent.
My Pokémon, too. They were born and\nraised under a circus tent.\c
The outside world is so very cruel...\nWe shall return to our circus tent.
Oi, you! Yeah, you! Snap to it!\nI'll be training you!
What?! You're down and out already?!\nThis is no bed! Get up!\c
Good! Enough!\nThat will do for today!\c
Fwah? You mean to challenge me?
Fwahaha! I win!\nBetter luck next time, punk!\c
Fwaah?! You defeated me?\nWho are you to do that?!\c
Ooh, it gives me shivers...\nI live for this moment.
Oh, yeah... That's it...\nPerfection doesn't come better...\c
It's gotten so I can't live without\nbattling anymore.\c
OK! I'm going to do it!\nI'm going to show you my best!
Gasp, gasp...\c
Never again!\nYou can forget about a next time!\c
Um... I'm honestly quite tough.\nPlease keep up.
I'm sorry.\nI don't think you measure up after all.\c
I'm amazed.\nI didn't think you'd win...\c
Let's go, me! Go, me, go!\nDon't lose, don't lose, rah, rah, rah!
Way to go, me! I'm so wonderful!\nRah, rah, rah! Gooooooo, me!\c
It's OK, me! Don't cry! Don't cry!\nGo home, go home, goooooo!\c
Woohoo! Here comes a cool Trainer!\nLet's see what you can bring!
Yes! Bravo!\nYou have some good attacks, Trainer!\c
Whaaaaat?! Nooooo!\nI can't get over how tough you are!\c
To serve and protect Pokémon and\nnature. That's my mission!
My skills I developed in the embrace of\nMother Nature!\c
My mission needs me!\nThis is where we bid good-bye!\c
Never fear, this Pokémon Ranger is\nhere to protect my own personal peace!
My personal peace has been protected!\c
You vile Trainer, you!\nYou've shattered my peace!\c
Any bad kids littering the fields?\nAny bad kids fouling the sea?
Be sure to sort your recyclables from\nthe trash when you're throwing it out!
Trash is like a battle.\nDon't be too quick to throw it!
Watch me, darling!\nI'm putting my best into this!
See, darling? Did you see?\nI put in my best effort for you.\c
I can't have my darling see me like this.\nHow pathetic I must look...\c
So, I lead with this... Then, counter...\nUgh, I can't get our strategy right!
To overanalyze can be a bad thing,\nI guess.\c
Waaah! Couldn't you have waited?\nUntil I'm ready at least?\c
How do you like my cape?\nI had it specially made!
What is my cape made of?\nI'm afraid I can't tell you.\c
Rip... Riiiiiiiiiiiipppppp!\n...What?! My cape! Waaaaah!\c
Do you know what real terror is?\nI am familiar with it. Intimately so...
You learned something today, yes?\nThe true meaning of terror.\c
Aiyeeh! What's with you?\nI'm pleading for mercy here!\c
See it! Hear it! Smell it!\nMarvel at my power!
That's right! Use all your senses and\nrealize what you were up against!\c
I didn't see anything! I'm not\nlistening! And I don't smell a thing!\c
Unluckily for you, your winning streak\nends with me.
You lost to me, but you're still on\nyour feet. Kudos to you!\c
This can't be. I won't accept it.\nThere has to be a mistake somewhere.\c
I c-c-can't stop shivering.\nB-but this is a b-battle. I have to.
Urrff... Ch-chatter...\nI won, I won...\c
Sh-shiver... Urf...\nMy eyelids are getting droopy...\c
I'll say good-bye to you now.\nBattles always end in tears.
Fweeeeh!\nMy tears of joy flow freely!\c
Fweeeeh!\nMy tears of anguish flow freely!\c
How amusing! You came here knowing of\nyour certain defeat?
Ahahahah! Very entertaining!\nI shall be happy to see you again!\c
Wh-what is happening...?\nM-my vision is turning milky white...\c
A Trainer am I, a new ray of hope from\nthe land of the midnight sun.
In the frigid falls of the north, I honed\nmy skills. With them, I made you fall.\c
Your foul trickery deserves contempt.\nBut effective it was, too.\c
I've been pondering lately...how much\nlonger will I be wearing shorts?
Will I still be in shorts as a grown-up?\c
If I grow old like this, will they call me\nsomething silly like “Shorts Man”?\c
That's right, I'm the legendary kid in\nshorts who's the talk of the town.
Even a Youngster in shorts like me can\nbe the stuff of legend or two.\c
My legend is over...\c
Uh... Um... H-hello.\nP-pleased to meet you.
S-s-sorry.\nI'm r-really n-nervous.\c
Uh... Th-thank you.\nThat was f-fun.\c
Oh, this place is so passé now.\nI'm missing out on shopping.
You're kind of stylish, actually.\nOh, I wish I had new clothes.\c
Maybe I'll collect accessories for some\nContests...\c
Exam season's coming up, but I'm\nneck-deep in battling...
Mom's going to cut me off.\nI just know it...\c
I have to keep up on both my studying\nand Pokémon...\c
Hiya, you Trainer there! Slip on some\nglasses. They'll make you look better.
Nothing's the matter with my eyes.\nI wear glasses for the looks I get.\c
Whoops!\nMy glasses, my glasses.\c
I've been taught every opponent has\na weakness. If I can find yours...
Eheheh.\nI figured out your weakness.\c
Did you figure out my weakness?\c
It's been so long since I had my last\nbattle.
You know, battling is fun after all.\c
Battling is so much fun, but...\c
The age of money has come to Pokémon\nbattling. I'll teach you who is right.
You understand, don't you?\nWhat is right, and who is stronger?\c
M-my Pokémon! What have you done?\nWhat am I to do?!\c
You're my opponent? Oh, all right...\nTry not to disappoint me too badly.
My Pokémon are all tops in luxury.\nDo you see? This is what power is about.\c
Nyah! I don't care! I've got enough \nmoney to fill a swimming pool!\c
You there. Yes, you.\nI'm feeling rather bored.
I suppose that was enjoyable for what\nit was. I'll thank you for it.\c
You are rather good.\nQuite remarkable, even.\c
I can sink your sort with minimal effort.
It took the barest of effort to win this\nmatch.\c
You swamped us with no effort at all...\c
My room is always full of bugs.\nThat drives my mom just wild.
I want to collect more bug Pokémon for\nmy bug appreciation station.\c
Bugs are loose under my shirt.\nI'm starting to itch...\c
People claim I'm like an adult. Whatever\ncould they mean, do you suppose?
Ah, yes, quite enjoyable!\nWe must do this again, surely.\c
Oh, yes! Smashing!\nThat chilled me to my toes, it did!\c
I have made my choice.\nWhen I fall, it shall be forward!
You lack conviction.\c
...Thud.\c
So, what exactly is a ninja,\nyou may ask.
A ninja is powerful.\nThat will do as a start.\c
Maybe some ninjas are weak?\c
I once saw a lady wearing the same\noutfit as me.
She said, “You're showing serious\nfashion chops.”\c
She said, “You're kidding me, am I\nright?”\c
Will you believe that inside this\ncostume is a grown-up Beauty?
My dream is to live as a Pokémon\none day. To become a Pokémon!\c
I'm an adult, but I want to be a\nPokémon. Does that make me weird?\c
My profile's riding high now, so my\nschedule's filled solid!
Oh, no! It's this late already?\nI'd better check my timetable!\c
Talent manager!\nDo I have time for a rematch?\c
Are you another of my fans? I can give\nyou an autograph if you'd lose?
Here's your autograph! Cherish it!\nOh, sorry! I don't do handshakes.\c
I'm sorry, I was acting GASTLY!\nIt was very DELCATTY of me!\c
I need to diet.\nI have to get out jogging.
Well, I guess I'll go for a quick trot\naround here...\c
Your Pokémon know how to punch hard.\nYou see, I'm really a boxer.\c
I look to bug Pokémon for hints on\nrunning all the time.
I admire the light and agile footwork of\nbug Pokémon.\c
Skitter...\c
Listen, I'm feeling bushed today.\nCan we do this tomorrow first thing?
Oh, all right. You're impatient.\nCouldn't wait till tomorrow, oh no.\c
That's why I said tomorrow.\nI can barely stay awake now.\c
Feed the Pokémon you catch, or they\nwill flee. Do you see?
Once a Pokémon has fled, it will never\nreturn. Do you see?\c
What I said about Pokémon, it is a\nparable. Do you see?\c
When I was younger, I went out on digs\nchasing rumors of hidden treasures.
Of course, there are no such things.\nBut it's about chasing a dream.\c
Well, it sure left huge holes...\nIn the ground and in my bank account.\c
I'll launch an avalanche of moves!\nI'll test your limits of endurance!
Well, Trainer?\nShould I try out some more moves?\c
That's it! I'm all out of stock!\nI'd like you to leave so I can close up!\c
I collect and battle Pokémon so I can\nbrag to my peers.
I'm not all that interested in winning\nor losing to begin with.\c
You've won the battle. But, in terms of\nthe Pokémon involved, I clearly win.
Did you want to see my Pokémon?\nOK, sure. Just a peek, though.
How's that for classy? My Pokémon are\ntops in both moves and character.\c
Hold it right there!\nYou can look, but don't touch!\c
Rock? Samba? Traditional folk?\nI can play in any style. It's all good!
Music and Pokémon uplift me!\nI'm carried up among the stars!\c
Sigh... I'm seeing stars...\nYou've got me singing the blues...\c
Let my exquisite melody ring out!\nHear my Pokémon shout out!
The melody from my Pokémon and me...\nDid it reach out and touch your heart?\c
I've been known to throw matches, but\nI'll never throw a guitar on stage!\c
I'm free like a bird!\nI feel like I could fly!
That's how I ended up becoming a Bird\nKeeper.\c
Like most birds, I can't see very well\nat night.\c
As a Trainer, I'm as fragile as an egg.\nPlease be gentle on me.
Do you think I'm getting ready to take\nflight?\c
One of these days, I'll break out of my\nshell and defeat you.\c
Bear witness to my display of machismo\nand masculinity!
There!\nThat's how a real man lives and battles!\c
Waaaah! Waaaah!\nMommy!\c
I've got a showdown coming up with a\nHiker. Let me see if I'm ready!
Yep, I'd say my team's about ready.\nThat Hiker won't know what hit him!\c
Aww, blast it, no!\nI can't beat that Hiker like this!\c
My showdown against a man of the sea\ndraws near! Let me test my team!
Everything went as calculated...\nBe ready for me, man of the sea!\c
Beating the man of the sea is impossible\nwith an outcome this lame...\c
Uhho uho-uho uhho hohoi!\nThis dance I use to psych myself up.
Uhho uho-uho uhho hohoi!\nSo much fun, I cannot stop.\c
Uhho uho-uho uhho hohoi!\nI dance to stem my tears from losing...\c
I'm not really with the police.\nI'm a collector of uniforms.
Battling as a Policeman made for a very\nfun battle, it did.\c
That's it for me.\nI bid you a fond farewell.\c
I'm a Policeman. But on holidays, I'm\nan entirely different kind of guy.
Usually, I chase after bad guys as a\nPoliceman.\c
On my days off, I chase after the waves\nand the ladies as a Swimmer.\c
Perseverance pays off.\nA case can turn on that.
It makes for more excitement when you\ncome from behind to take the win.\c
That was more thrilling than any\nstakeout! Thanks for that!\c
My present case can go either way.\nIt's a coin toss.
So, I won this time...\nAll decided by a fickle coin...\c
Best two out of three?\c
I live in the woods.\nYou know, I'm a Camper.
I'm working on making camp life more\ncomfortable.\c
I am sick and tired of camping out in the\nwoods...\c
No, no, I can't do this!\nI'm not cut out for battling!
Oh, wow! I won! What'll I do?\nYou're not mad at me, are you?\c
See! I told you before we started!\nBattling just isn't for me.\c
Trainer spotted!\nIt's time to get cooking!
A battle should be enjoyed like a tasty\nmeal!\c
I ended up getting cooked!\c
Fweeoo-fwee-fwee-fyoo...\nI saunter into battle, whistling...
Too easy! I was whistling all the way\nthrough that.\c
Fwee-ooo fwee-ooo fwee-ooo...\nI switched to an ambulance siren...\c
I can hear it... The screaming adulation\nof 100,000 fans rising in unison...
Right on, everyone! You saw that!\nI dedicate my win to you!\c
You're scorching...\nYou've made a fan out of me.\c
Number one worldwide, that's my dream.\nWell, to start, anyway.
“Number one worldwide,” now doesn't\nthat have a good ring to it?\c
I can't quite decide what I should be\nnumber one worldwide at.\c
I'm not some cheap Idol!\nI'm an actress! Please remember that!
My career isn't anything like your\ntypical Idol's career!\c
I'm an actress...\nIt sounds so deliciously right...\c
We're not here for a long time, so let's\nmake it a good time!
Thank you! That was soooo fun!\nI really hope we can battle again!\c
It makes me sad having to say\ngood-bye... Please come see me again!\c
I am the Fan Club Division Manager...\nBring your best to bear...
Kneel before the might of the Fan Club!\c
Gweh! But I did my best!\nRegrets, I have none!\c
I welcome you, young Trainer.\nAllow me to demonstrate my power.
Young Trainer, do you have any idea\nwhat my power signifies?\c
You've surpassed me in your love of\nPokémon. You're the truest of fans.\c
I think I'll try out the TM the woman\nnext door gave me.
I am impressed. That woman actually\ngave me something useful.\c
Oh, that nasty woman!\nThis TM is worthless!\c
I heard that! I may be old enough to be\nyour mom, but I'm still young!
Look at my skin tone and Pokémon!\nBoth firm, but supple!\c
Please don't make that mistake again!\nI'm young, I tell you!\c
Whether it be work or play, I'm with my\nPokémon all day.
Life without Pokémon?\nI can't picture that.\c
It's like I'm married to my Pokémon.\nI'm not married, though.\c
You get to be the best by working\nharder than everyone else.
I reckon I've been a hard worker.\c
Work at battling over and over.\nYour star will shine one day.\c
I'm going to become famous here so I\ncan rebuild the ranch.
I can't lose.\nIt's for my pa and ma.\c
If I can get famous, folks'll pay to\nvisit my ranch...\c
From sundown, I live by candlelight\nuntil I go to sleep.
That's not to say I don't have electric\npower on the homestead.\c
Candlelight can be very romantic.\c
I'd like to introduce you to my\ncherished partners.
Good, good. Good going, gang.\nYou guys all did great.\c
Wheeze... Wheeze...\nI'm feeling faint...\c
I'm no green thumb at growing Berries.\nRaising Pokémon is where I shine.
I can give you tips on raising Pokémon\nso they'll grow tough.\c
Raising a living thing is never an easy\njob...\c
Pokémon are Pokémon, no matter how\ntough, weak, cute, or scary.
Raise Pokémon with love, and they'll\nreturn it.\c
I think it's the Trainer who needs to\npick up the pace here.\c
Raising a Pokémon right takes money and\ntime.
But it's all worthwhile when the\nPokémon grows up.\c
To raise the ideal Pokémon,\nI'm willing to work hard.\c
That's right, I'm tough. I won't lose.\nI don't think losing's possible.
Yup, I'm so tough...\nEhehe... Heeheehee...\c
I lost? But, how...?\nWhat now? What do I do?\c
I'm an Ace Trainer, so this is for\nbragging rights.
Yup, you did good.\nNo, seriously.\c
Heh...\nI've got a long ways to go...\c
I was looking forward to a battle with\nyou!
I was right! You are pretty decent.\nWhy not become an Ace Trainer?\c
You're as good as the rumors say...\nMay I have a rematch one day?\c
Look at me.\nI'm what you should be aspiring to be.
You expected anything else?\c
You've already surpassed me.\nBut you can aim so much higher.\c
My whole life hinges on this one battle!\n...Lose for me, pretty please?
Yeah! I won!\nIt's all smooth sailing for me now!\c
I wasn't supposed to lose...\nThat's my life derailed...\c
I'm running a fever here.\nJust so's you know.
Oogh, my head's burning up.\nIt makes me feel more inspired.\c
Like I said, I have a cold.\nI'm not on top of my game.\c
When we battle, I want you to be very\ncareful. My coat's very expensive.
Yikes! Eek! Watch out! You almost got\nPokémon sweat on my coat!\c
I was worried about getting my coat\ndirty. Who cares about your battle?\c
I wish you'd leave.\nI don't want to see you lose.
I told you so...\nCan you leave, please?\c
Listen...is being tough not always a\ngood thing?\c
Whoa-whoa-whoa... Careful now!\nMaintaining balance is the key!
Whoops...! Almost went over!\nHave to be careful here...\c
...Waaaaaah...\nThud!\c
Now don't you worry about a thing.\nYou leave everything to me, OK?
What do you say? Fun, hey?\nIt'd be nice if we could meet again.\c
Well, I'll be!\nYou sure got the best of me!\c
I will battle. It's not likely I will lose.\nI'm tough.
I win.\nI could do a dance right now.\c
What is the matter?\nWhy couldn't I win?\c
Mother Nature, I beseech you!\nPlease, lend me strength!
Oh, Mother Nature, I thank you!\nTo you, I dedicate this victory!\c
I'm sorry, Mother Nature!\nI'm sorry to disappoint you!\c
A good Trainer takes on all challenges\nregardless of the foe or the rules.
No Trainer can be considered bad if\nthey battle the best they can.\c
A good Trainer doesn't gloat over a win.\nThey just prepare for the next battle.\c
Come hither, my Pokémon!\nPlease get rid of this mean Trainer!
Ooh, yes, I love you, my sweeties!\cCome here and give me a kiss!
How could you?!\nYou hurt my sweet little ones!\c
I'm fine with practice and training, but\nI wilt when the chips are down.
I feel sick from tension!\nI'd rather be at home practicing!\c
If it's about practice, I'd be the\nchamp without a doubt.\c
Hi-yah! Hah! Hah!\nOne more! Hah! Hah!
Boo-yah!\c
Hi-yah! ...No, wait!\nNo!\c
Wanna?
Heh...\c
You beat me?\nWhere's your dojo?\c
Come oooon! C'mon, c'mon!\nHey! Hey! C'mon, hey!
Oh, yesssss!\c
Oh, noooooo!\c
Your eyes are unclouded by doubt.\nThis match will be entertaining...
From my heart, I look forward to your\nreturn.\c
Whew... A most entertaining match.\nI hope you'll grant me a rematch.\c
You need to be taught what wisdom of\nage means in battle!
I'll have you know that no child can\nhope to defeat me!\c
That did not happen! Unfair!\nI demand a rematch right now!\c
I'm feeling cranky today!\nHelp me get my mind off it!
Whew... A battle is the perfect\nstress reliever!\c
Eeeeeeeeh!\nYou've pushed me over to furious!\c
Cue battle music, please!\nI want to trumpet my victory!
I love the battle music.\nIt sets my heart racing.\c
Fine, that will do.\nBack to the regular theme music.\c
When you've been a Trainer as long as\nI have, let's just say you'll see a lot.
Things like this happen.\nDon't let it get you down.\c
People and Pokémon are all different.\nIsn't that what makes it beautiful?
My big brother told me to go for the\neyes! Aim for the eyes!
I did it, big brother!\c
My big brother told me to wreck the\nother Trainer's accuracy!\c
I hear my Pokémon calling out...\nThey clamor to battle...
I hear my Pokémon calling out...\nThey call for your return...\c
I hear my Pokémon calling out...\nThey tell me of the fun they had...\c
Behind you, I see light.\nWhat is its significance?
I thought I saw an aura of invincibility.\nI must have been mistaken.\c
Now I see...\nYou glow with the light of victory...\c
I'll deliver defeat to you elegantly\nand speedily.
Thank you for your patience!\c
I'm so terribly sorry.\nI ended up with your intended defeat.\c
Great, another tough-looking Trainer.\nThe fun never ends for me.
Bleah, that was too close for comfort.\nNothing ever comes easy for me.\c
Yeah, see? I knew I'd lose.\nIf only that move landed...\c
Everyone has too much to say about\nPokémon! If it's fun, that's enough!
Excuse me, but are you all right?\nMaybe you're a little too tired?\c
If you get too caught up in winning and\nlosing, you'll burn yourself out.\c
Aren't you the cutest guest! You can\nexpect the best service from me!
Well, were you impressed by the level\nof service I provided?\c
Oh, wait, please!\nI'm not done serving you!\c
I keep a journal about the lives of the\nTrainers who arrive here.
In our vast world, I wonder how many\nTrainers will cross my path?\c
Every encounter ends in parting.\nThat's why I keep a journal.\c
I've waited all my life for someone like\nyou. I'm never letting you go.
It was a ploy to confuse you with\nwords out of some romance movie.\c
Now, go on, don't let me hold you back.\nSeize your chance at happiness!\c
Will you give me an interview if you win?
You made my job too easy.\nYou need to buckle down.\c
Your feelings now, in a word!\nShout it into the mike, please!\c
I'm on a diet...\nI'm so famished...
I'm happy, but if I get excited, I'll get\nhungry. No thanks...\c
Oh...\nYour Pokémon look delicious...\c
Let me make it clear right now, I'm\ntougher than you can stand!
See?\nI wasn't exaggerating!\c
Who are you exactly?!\c
Clear the way! Out of the way!\nWait! Don't go! We have to battle!
Come on, take it up a gear!\nKeep up with me!\c
OK, out of the way! Clear the way!\nLet this loser run away!\c
Safe driving and safer battling.\nThat's my motto.
You can be patient in a battle.\nVictory will come eventually.\c
I'll keep to my own pace.\nI'll catch up to you one day.\c
I only have this bike to look good for\nthe ladies. I can't actually ride.
It was a pain getting this bike here.\nI had to push it all the way!\c
I'm only concerned about looking good.\nI don't practice enough.\c
I'm not looking for any excitement.\nI don't need any drama.
A battle is all the excitement I need.\c
I recently realized that I'm not cut\nout for this scary job.\c
I'll battle my way.\nYou battle yours.
People are people.\nI'll go my own way.\c
People are people.\nYou go your own way.\c
Today, I have a special treat for all\nmy fans!
Thank you!\nI love your support!\c
Are you really one of my fans?\c
I'm burnt out on being an Idol.\nI want to go home to the country...
I can't quit now!\nKids dream of being me!\c
I miss hearing my mother's voice...\c
I'm one of a kind.\nThat's what I'm saying.
I keep it real.\nThat's what makes me tough.\c
I kept it real, but you won anyway.\nYour reality was more real.\c
Hi! Are you my next opponent?\nLet's keep it clean and fair!
It feels great going all out with no\ndirty tricks.\c
That was an awesome workout!\nWe have to do this again sometime!\c
My needs are simple.\nFishing and Moomoo Milk are all I need.
Winning or losing isn't something I pay\nheed to.\c
I could use some Moomoo Milk right\nabout now.\c
You there! Take a look at the Pokémon\nI fished up the other day.
I can tell you're impressed. This guy,\nI don't know how long it took to land.\c
A word of advice: when an older person\nis bragging, pretend to be interested.\c
You're a Trainer.\nLet your Pokémon do the talking.
Where's your spirit?\nThat didn't speak to me at all.\c
Great! Great!\nYour feelings came across!\c
Here comes your prey!\nGet 'em! Chaaaarge!
Gaahahaha!\nThat's it! Good job!\c
We're outmatched!\nPull back, guys! Run away!\c
Bring it on!\nOoooh! Haaah!
Thank you kindly!\c
Thanks for having me!\c
I am captivated by the mountains.\nThey're the main thing in my life!
The mountains mean more to me\nthan any battle, no matter how fun!\c
Your battle skills are impressive, but I\ncan't wait to return to the mountains.\c
We're going to hammer you, kid.\nDon't freeze up and close your eyes.
I like how you stay defiant even after\nlosing. Good attitude, kid.\c
Honest, I didn't let up one bit or let\ndown my guard because you're a kid.\c
I battle around the globe.\nI'm a worldwide bad boy!
I don't lose at battling.\nI can't get over how cool I am!\c
I'm hitting the road over that loss.\nIt's good-bye to the old me!\c
Battles, I'm good at.\nBut musical aptitude? Forget it.
This whole battling thing is good, but\nI wish I could play music as well.\c
Music or Pokémon...\nIt's a tough choice.\c
I wrote a song using the cries of\nPokémon. I'd like you to hear it.
Graaah wagyaaah! Wagyaaaah!\nChu! Chu! Gyaroooh-gah!\c
Giiyaaaah! Drundundun!\nGaroo-gah! Wawawaaah!\c
I'm bored of collecting and hoarding.\nI'm getting rid of everything now.
There's nothing that I really want now.\nMaybe I'll become a clown...
I threw the match for a start.\nIt's nice to be unburdened of things.
Oh! Hold on a second!\nIncoming text message!
Ticka-ticka-ticka... Ticka-tick...\nHuh? Is it over already?\c
Hey, stop that!\nNo peeking at my text messages!\c
There's no meaning to this battle!\nPokémon should be about love!
Battling leaves me empty.\nHug your Pokémon and show your love!\c
Battling creates nothing.\nHug your Pokémon and show your love!\c
Are you challenging me? ...You are.\nKids these days...
Now run along home, and go help your\nmommy with her chores!\c
Hey, you... If you think playtime will\nlast forever, you'll end up like me.\c
How will you counter my implacable logic?
Everything according to calculation...\nThis victory is a complete one.\c
You outcalculated me.\nI'm incredulous.\c
I've been ensconced in the lab.\nMy shoulders are all knotted up.
What a refreshing break!\nI'm feeling loose and relaxed now.\c
My Pokémon and I, we all need to get\noutside and exercise more.\c
Hmmm... So young...\nI may have to go easy...
You're so depressingly young...\nIt's fine. You may go.\c
Consider the loser's feelings.\nThat's where you young people fail...\c
You see an old man, yes?\nDon't be fooled by the way I look.
I find it abhorrent to lose to any young\nTrainer.\c
I was fooled by your youth.\nFoolish, foolish me...\c
As a Worker, it's my job to both build\nand demolish.
Why don't you become a Worker, too?\nI find it fun and rewarding.\c
Making things is harder than\ndemolishing, but it's more satisfying.\c
You and your Pokémon, I'll clean up on\nyou easily.
Well, well, how pathetic was that.\nTake your passengers and go home.\c
Gwaah... So heavy...\nMy guys buckled under the load.\c
Outstanding athleticism and a great\nsense of humor; that's a clown!
A clown is a job of greatness.\nOnly the chosen can become one!\c
The ability to laugh off disappointment\nis another requirement for a clown!\c
Laugh with the face and cry with the\nheart; that's how a clown lives.
Ahahahahaha!\c
Gah! ...Ahahahaha!\c
Oi, listen! I'm a Policeman, sure, but a\nTrainer before that!
What?\nA Policeman can't lose his temper?\c
Yes, I'm a Policeman, but I have dreams\nand aspirations, and, and... Snivel...\c
Hands up! Put 'em where I can see 'em!\nYou're all under arrest!
Case closed!\c
This is a gross miscarriage of justice!\c
I'll have you know that I'm an Internet\ndetective.
My powers of observation and logic\nprevailed!\c
Think you've outsmarted me?\nMaybe this was just a sting operation!\c
Wherever, whenever, and with whomever.\nThat's my motto!
When, where, or whom...\nIt doesn't matter at all to me.\c
Hahaha! This is great!\nI want to keep this going!\c
The loser has to pretend to be a\nSTUNKY, OK?
Giggle, you lose.\nI want to see your STUNKY impression!\c
OK, here's my STUNKY impression!\nThree, two, one...\c
A good breeze has sprung up...\nThis is good! I can win this!
The tailwind put us over the top!\n...As they say!\c
The headwind worked against us!\n...As they say!\c
Even though I always have my parasol\nup, I actually like sunny days.
I hope it will be sunny tomorrow...\c
The heavy downpour in my heart...\nWhen will it ever stop...?\c
My, you're very eager to go. I'd better\ntake the tension up a notch, too!
I had a lot of fun with that match!\nWouldn't it be nice to see you again!\c
You're so full of energy!\nWhy, I feel energized, too!\c
How much longer do I have to wait for a\nTrainer that's any good?
I'm so bored by the weak competition.\nMaybe I'll just retire.\c
Oh, hello, there.\nNow, you're a little special.\c
My ladylike charms don't mean a thing\nto a little kid...
That was too close for comfort!\nIt doesn't pay to underestimate foes.\c
Battling fair and square doesn't appeal\nto me. I'd rather win.\c
Like everything else, people have likes\nand dislikes when it comes to scents.
I love how Pokémon smell after a battle.\c
I feel a little thrill if I catch a whiff\nof intense effort postbattle.\c
Sniff, sniff... Yes! Here it comes!\nAroma power!
With aroma power, I'm invincible!\c
Fizzle...\nI'm out of aroma power...\c
Turn, step, turn, turn... I'll practice\nmy dance steps while battling!
I dance with passion and precision.\nHow can there be a weakness?\c
You're throwing off my rhythm!\nMy dance routine is ruined!\c
I'm always ready for the public eye.\nYou can come at me at your own pace.
That's why people consider me the\nperfect Idol.\c
I didn't know how bad it feels to lose.\nThis is a first for me.\c
   
    
    
   
    
    
   
    
    
   
    
    
   
    
    
   
Ah, wonderful! That was fantastic!\nDo come again!\c
I have no problem with losing to a\nspectacular Trainer like you!\c
   
Ah, wonderful! That was fantastic!\nDo come again!\c
I have no problem with losing to a\nspectacular Trainer like you!\c
What Pokémon do you want up on stage?\nI can't wait!
That was a most enjoyable time!\nThank you! Come again, please.\c
Oh... I detest how fun times seem to\nend so quickly.\c
What Pokémon do you want to show off\nthis time?\rI can't wait!
How wonderful that was!\nThank you! Come again, please.\c
It's so sad how the truly fun times\nseem to last only a moment.\c
It doesn't matter what you throw at\nme. I'll always win.\cMy investigative and analytical system\nis truly amazing.
See?\nJust as analyzed.\c
Whoa!\nYou sure showed me!\c
It doesn't matter what you throw at\nme. I'll always win.\cI'll stake my investigative and\nanalytical system on it!
See?\nJust as analyzed.\c
Whoa!\nYou sure showed me!\c
Always be smiling!\nLuck comes to those who are happy!\cThat's why I always keep a big smile and\nbelieve in my Pokémon when I battle.
You're very good!\nI had a lot of fun!\c
You're so very, very good!\nMy Pokémon had a good time, too!\c
Whenever I battle someone tough,\nI smile. I cannot help it!\cHow about you? What do you do?\nDo you laugh? Cry? Get angry?
Win or lose, whenever I battle someone\nwonderful, I am happy!\c
Battling a wonderful Trainer is always\na happy occasion!\c
Very well...\nShall we begin?
Ah, a most valiant effort.\cThough I was lucky enough to win this\ntime, the next time...\c
My Pokémon could not be faulted in any\nway or form.\cMy hat's off to you.\c
This is for Lady Caitlin's sake.\nI'm afraid I must go all out.
Ah, a most valiant effort.\cThough I was lucky enough to win this\ntime, the next time...\c
Your skills are superlative as ever!\nMy admiration knows no bounds.\c

Forget it!\nThis isn't over yet!\n
My Pokémon's getting low on HP...\nThings could be tight here.\n
What's going on here?\nWhat, I lost?!\n
Think you can take down the \nnext Pokémon like you did earlier?\n
No way! Not yet!\nNot giving up!\n
W-what? That can't be!\nMy buffed-up Pokémon!\n
You avoided the long way around?\nLet's see why you'd do that!\c
Now I understand why you decided to\nbattle with me.\n
You should go whichever way you\nwant, shortcut or the long way!\n
Only those who want to win can\nchallenge a Pokémon Gym!\c
Gggh...\nThis is humiliating!\n
One day, I'm going to become a tough\nTrainer like you.\n
You're a Pokémon Trainer, and so am I!\nOur eyes met, so battle we must!\c
Too strong!\nToo strong!
Don't be shy about talking to\nTrainers you'd like to battle.\cPokémon grow stronger and stronger\nfrom battling.
Did you get better since we met?\nI... Well, here, just look!\c
Let's have a Pokémon battle!\nHumph! But I'm gonna win!\c
You beat me?!\nYou've got talent!
It was fun battling!\nYup! I'm going to battle everyone!
Let's have another Pokémon battle!\nThis time, I'm gonna win!\c
I spy, with my little eye...\nA Trainer!\cA battle, please!\c
Oh, boo!\nI can't win!
My Pokémon are all tuckered out!\nI need to go to a Pokémon Center!
Oh, hi!\nI remember you, Trainer!\cA battle, please!\c
I get my get-up-and-go from my\nPokémon!\cHere we go!\nKRICKETOT! ZUBAT!\c
Ack! My Pokémon...
Keep out of the grass or dodge the\neyes of Trainers...?\cI always have a tough time choosing.\n
Hey, I remember your face, Trainer.\nYou'll battle me again, won't you?\c
I'm never apart from my SHINX.\nOur bond is strong!\c
So sad...\nAnd so crushed...\n
I don't bear grudges over losing.\nBut I promise I'll get tougher!\n
I'm always with my Pokémon.\cActually, you're always with your\nPokémon too, aren't you?\c
Before I challenge the Pokémon Gym\nLeader, I'll test my strength on you!\c
I guess it means I'm not ready for\nthe Gym challenge yet...\n
I guess if you don't have a single\nGym Badge, you're a total nobody...\n
I'm about ready to challenge the\nPokémon Gym Leader.\cBut before I do, let me test my\nstrength on you again!\c
I got a nifty-keen Gym Badge from\nthe Gym Leader in Oreburgh City!\c
Oh, I lost! Lalala!\n
I'm collecting lots of Gym Badges.\nThey're so sparkly and pretty!\n
I got a nifty-keen Gym Badge from\nthe Gym Leader in Oreburgh City!\c...Did I show you already?\c
I found a Trainer while looking for\nsome Pokémon!\c
Hunh? You're finished so soon?\n
I walk through tall grass until I\nfind the Pokémon I want.\n
I found a familiar-looking Trainer!\c
Oh, a weak-looking Trainer...\nDo you want to have a go?\c
Aww...\nI should have said no.\n
Oh, you're so mean!\nI just started training Pokémon!\n
Hi, pretty-tough Trainer!\nWill you give me a rematch?\c
I'll beat you with the MAGIKARP my dad\ngave me!\c
But they're Pokémon I got from my\ndad...\n
Who gave you your first Pokémon?\cYour first Pokémon is the one with\nthe most fond memories, I think.\n
This time, I'll beat you with the\nPokémon my dad gave me!\c
May I please trouble you for a\nbattle?\c
Oh...\nYou're so strong...\n
Maybe I could have won if my Pokémon\nwas holding a Berry...\n
Excuse me, may I please trouble you to\nhave one more battle?\c
Hey, hey, let me show off my bug\nPokémon!\c
I'm not going to be able to explain\nthe charms of bug Pokémon this way!\n
Bug Pokémon grow quickly, and they do\nstuff like poison and paralyze, and\rthey're cute and yet cool.\cYou gotta believe me. They're good!\n
So, listen. Tell me you've grown to\nlike bug Pokémon since we last met?\c
What kind of person are you, to be\ndrawn here by the scent of flowers?\c
It was a strong Trainer who was drawn\nhere by the scent of flowers!\n
By the way, have you collected new\napps from the Pokétch Company?\n
You came back to me because you\ncouldn't forget the smell of flowers!\c
Liv: We can one-shot this Trainer,\ncan't we, Liz?\c
Liv: Oh, oh, oh?\n
Liv: This Trainer...will brag about\nbeating us, Liz.\n
Liv: You only have one Pokémon?\nThat's so boring!
Liv: Oh! You're that Trainer!\nLet's get payback, Liz!\c
Liz: We're the strongest in our\nclass!\c
Liz: Oh, but, wait!\n
Liz: This Trainer...is really happy about\nbeating us, Liv.\n
Liz: Um, will you battle with us?\nMe and Liv?\n
Liz: We're the best in our class.\nWe can't be losers all the time!\c
Hey, how about you and me battle before\nI go into Eterna Forest?\c
That really dampened my spirits.\n
I heard that really tough Pokémon\nappear in Eterna Forest.\cI need to be more prepared than this!\n
You've been to Eterna Forest\nalready, right? How was it?\c
It's a long way between Floaroma\nand Eterna City. So, let's battle!\c
Wawawaah!\nI'm out of Pokémon that can go!\n
Camping with Pokémon!\nDo you have any idea how fun that is?\n
While I was enjoying camping, my\nPokémon got all buffed up!\c
What kinds of Pokémon live around\nhere, I wonder?\c
I'm shocked!\nHow did I lose?\n
I know all sorts of things about\nPokémon!\cLet's see... There are males and\nfemales, and some aren't either!\n
Oh, hi! We meet again!\nHave you seen any rare Pokémon?\c
Oh, I don't know.\nShould I play a little?\c
Oh, boo!\nHow insulting!\n
Listen very closely...\nCan you hear the cries of Pokémon?\n
Oh, I don't know.\nShould I play a little again?\c
There's no mountain here, but I'm\ndressed to hike! Gahaha! Here goes!\c
Oh, yeah!\nA refreshing battle that was!\n
You can find the same kinds of\nPokémon in all sorts of places.\cThere's no law saying a Hiker can't\ngo searching off in the mountains!\n
If you meet someone in the mountains,\nthey're no longer strangers.\cMeet them twice, and they're your\nfriend!\c
I've lost my way...\nHere of all places...\c
Having lost his way, the Trainer lost\nthe battle too...\n
From being lost in the mountains so\nlong, I became a Hiker...\n
I've lost my way again...\cYes, it's me again with no sense of\ndirection...\c
Hiyah!\nThere's no holding anything back!\c
I... I concede!\nI think you're on a different level...\n
Hiyah! You put me in my place!\nI appreciate it!\n
Hiyah! This time, there really is no\nholding anything back!\c
I love Pokémon that smell sweet.\nLike this one--get a whiff of this!\c
Did you understand what I meant?\nDidn't my Pokémon smell nice?\n
If you plant lots of Berries, you\ncan be surrounded by sweet scents.\n
Sniff... Oh?\nYour Pokémon smells nice!\c
Nothing's biting...\nI could use a break, I suppose.\c
Well, that didn't do anything for me...\n
!\cYank your fishing rod when that\nappears. That's how you fish.\n
All right! I caught some tough\nPokémon. I'm ready for battle!\c
How about that!\nI've netted me a feisty Trainer!\c
I let a big win slip away...\n
Do you have a fishing rod?\nCatch some big ones!\n
Hey, you feisty tyke! I caught a big\none! Let's battle again!\c
I fished up some tough Pokémon!\nLet's have ourselves a battle!\c
Losing to a kid has me gasping like\na MAGIKARP...\n
My feet are tangled, too!\nOuch! Ouch!\n
I'm going to win this time!\nI said I'll win, and I mean it!\c
Yo! Cycling and Pokémon!\nWhich do you prefer?\c
Hey, not bad, you!\n
This Cycling Road is one fine place--\ngreat bikes, superb Pokémon,\rand awesome Trainers all around!\n
I'm sure I've seen your face before.\nDid we maybe battle?\c
Ding-ding! Watch out, you!\nOr, did you want to battle?\c
Despite all the effort, I'm just spinning\nmy wheels...\cIt's always that way with me!\n
I might try racing through Cycling\nRoad in one long shot.\n
There you are!\cI've been riding in this spot so I'd\nget a rematch with you!\c
That Bike you've got there...it's the\ntype that can change gears!\cYou gotta love that!\nSure, I'll give you a battle!\c
Crash! Tinkle...\n
The 3-speed makes for easy turning,\nand the 4-speed's for going fast.\cI love them both!\n
Is your bicycle geared to 3-speed now?\nOr do you have it set to 4-speed?\c
A bike will carry you a long way.\cThe only thing that limits you is your\nown endurance!\c
Gasp... Gasp... Gasp...\n
My Pokémon and I are plumb worn out.\nWe should be getting home to rest...\n
We took a recuperative rest.\nWe're not losing this time!\c
Cycling feels great!\cIt will feel even better when I beat\nyou in a battle!\c
Whew!\nYou worked us over.\n
I like spinning the pedals backward\nwhile sailing downhill.\n
It feels great on my Bike!\cI'm already sweaty, so let's have a\nrematch!\c
The both of us are on Bikes, and we\nboth have Pokémon!\cI can't let you get the better of me!\c
Oh, geez...\nI seem to have fallen off my Bike.
I should have challenged you to a race,\nnot a battle!\n
I hate knowing you've beaten me.\nThis time, I'm going to win!\c
If you beat me, you can count on\nsomething rotten coming your way!\c
Kerrrash!
Aww!\nWhy did you beat me?!\cI hope you get so lost in Wayward Cave\nyou cry! Boo-hoo-hoo!\n
I had to get my revenge on you.\cI trained my Pokémon while wandering\rlost in Wayward Cave!\c
Some people compete over speed, and\nsome compete over technique.\cWhich kind are you?\c
You're a speedy technician!\n
I enjoy the scenery.\cDon't you think the area below\nCycling Road looks nice?\n
I polished up both my speed and\ntechniques. Can you beat me now?\c
Whoa! You startled me!\nWell, we may as well battle!\c
Your power startles me!\n
We Hikers are bighearted guys!\nLosing doesn't bother us!\n
Whoa! You startled me!\nWe may as well have a rematch!\c
I wear shorts the whole year!\nI've got energy to burn!\c
I couldn't win with just energy...\nNothing's really that easy!\n
Pokémon don't wear clothes.\nI worry about them getting cold.\n
I wear shorts! I have lots of\nenergy! I'm not losing to you!\c
Go for it, my Pokémon!\nI'll do my best, too!\c
Oh...\nWe lost...\n
Dig for Fossils in the Underground.\cThe mining museum might be able to\nbring back the ancient Pokémon!\n
Go for it, my Pokémon!\nI'll do more than my best this time!\c
Go do it, my Pokémon!\nI'll work hard, too!\c
Oh...\nWe lost...
I think we'll visit the TV station in\nJubilife City next.\cOr maybe we should go to the Global\nTerminal?\n
Umm, aren't you that Trainer who beat\nus before?\cWe feel good today, so we'll be happy\nto face you again!\c
Wahaha!\nLaughter brings good fortune!\c
Wahahaha! There's nothing that\nI can do but laugh!\n
Wahahahaha!\n...Go ahead, laugh at me--the loser!\n
Wahaha!\cLaughter brings good fortune!\nForgetting your gloves brings a cold!\c
I just got through Mt. Coronet, but\nI've still got energy to burn!\c
Whoops!\nTaken down easily!\n
We need to rest up in Oreburgh City\nbefore heading to Mt. Coronet again.\n
I just got through Mt. Coronet,\nand who do I see?\cA Trainer who we've battled before!\c
OK, OK!\nLet's be quick about this!\c
Oh, yeah? Let's do this again!\n...Oops. I'm out of Pokémon!\n
Yup! Good going!\nI like the way you battle!\n
What took you so long?\cWe've waited here a long time for\na rematch with you!\c
Gahahaha! You're just a little kid!\cHow're you supposed to beat a big\nman like me?\c
Oh my, a big man like me got schooled\nby a little kid like you!\n
Wow, you're sure impressive!\cI guess it makes no difference if\nyou're young or old in battles.\n
Hey, you, tough little kid!\nThrow us a rematch, will you?\c
They call me the Echo Man!\nBattle with me! Yahoo!\c
Ohh... Yo...\nYodelay...\n
Here's good advice from the Echo Man!\cIf you're at a loss as to where you\nshould be going, check the Town Map!\n
Oh, hi there! Remember us?\nI'm the Echo Man!\cLet's have another battle!\nYahoo!\c
If I beat you, will you share some\nfood with me?\c
We were starved for food, and now\nwe're starved for a win...\n
Sigh... I feel even hungrier...\nMaybe I'll chow down some Berries...\cBut that's kind of gross.\nWhat am I, a Pokémon?\n
I, uh, chowed down my packed lunch\nbefore we started climbing.\cIf I beat you this time, share some\nfood with me!\c
This karate man's going to pulverize\nyou!\c
We got pulverized...\n
It's obvious I need to train myself\nand my Pokémon harder.\cHey, if you've got a Vs. Seeker, you'd\nbetter put it to good use.\cNothing beats some repeated battling\nfor toughening up your Pokémon.\n
This karate man hasn't forgotten\nbeing pulverized by you!\c
Muhihi...\nI'll haul you up and out!\c
Restraint is my favorite word.\nLike...from crushing my opponents.\n
You need a Good Rod if you want to\ncatch good Pokémon.\n
Muhihi... There won't be any\nrestraint this time, OK?\c
Oh, you want to have a battle?\cI was meaning to enter a Contest,\nbut beating you won't take long...\c
Oh, you have us beaten.\n
You and your Pokémon have so much\nenergy.\cI think you would do well in\nContests, too.\n
Oh, didn't we meet before?\cI was meaning to enter a Contest,\nbut let's have a quick battle first.\c
You and I!\cLet us create a scene!\nA fantastic tableau of battle!\c
Magnificent!\nI am aglow with inspiration!\n
That battle will surely become a\nstupendous masterpiece painting!\cI shall title it...\c“My Pokémon Is Fight”!\n
The key to becoming a good painter\nis to be observant.\cThat is the same for battling.\nOne must be observant!\c
Let me see how much you've raised\nyour Pokémon.\c
Good stuff! Your Pokémon are in\nimpeccable condition.\n
It's obvious you raise your Pokémon\nwith a lot of love.\n
I've raised my Pokémon since we met.\nHow much have you raised yours?\c
Please, let me battle the Pokémon\nyou've raised!\c
Giggle...\nThey're raised with a lot of care!\n
Raise your Pokémon with lots of love,\nand they'll bond closely with you.\n
You're that Trainer who treats Pokémon\nwith a lot of love!\cPlease, let me battle the Pokémon\nyou've raised again!\c
Say, honey, where'd you come from?\nWhat kinds of Pokémon are you with?\c
Fancy folks like you have fancy\nPokémon too, it looks like.\n
While working the ranch, I get to raise\nmy Pokémon, too.\cI'd say it's the best of both worlds!\n
Oh, howdy! Come visiting again?\nWhat kinds of Pokémon'd you bring?\c
I jog every morning to keep my\nPokémon fit.\c
Oops!\nYou threw off my running rhythm.\n
Nothing beats being fit and healthy!\cCome on, won't you run with me?\nTo a better tomorrow!\n
Do you jog every morning, too?\n
When I go on my jogs, I pass by lots\nof people.\cI have trouble remembering faces,\nbut we did meet before, right?\c
                      
                            
                           
                   
                         
                                      
               
              
                        
Hi, hi!\nI'm a Pokémon!\c
So sad...\nSo bitter...\n
I don't want to be a Trainer.\nI want to be a Pokémon!\n
Hi, hi!\nI'm a Pokémon!\c...You knew that, didn't you?\c
                       
           
                        
Ty: You're not supposed to intrude\non my time with Sue!\c
Ty: I only have eyes for Sue.\nMaybe that's why we lost?\n
Ty: Sue, even in defeat, you're\nso beautiful...!\n
Ty: I don't want to do anything\nwithout Sue...\cBring two Pokémon at least, OK?\n
Ty: Did you come back to intrude\non my time with Sue?\c
Sue: Huh?\nYou want to battle with me?\cI will if I can team with Ty!\c
Sue: I'm sorry, Ty!\n
Sue: We lost... Ty, I need a hug\nto make it all better!\n
Sue: I only want to battle next to my\nsweet Ty.\cDon't you have two Pokémon?\n
Sue: Oh, it's you again!\nI'll battle if I can team with Ty!\c
                      
                   
                                 
                                               
                                
                       
                                               
                                                      
Jogging is about rhythm.\nBattling is about rhythm, too!\c
It's a goal of sorts, I'd say!\n
If I get out of rhythm, I can't get my\nact together.\n
When I was jogging the other day,\na wild Pokémon came after me.\cI ran so fast, I was on top of the\nwaves, I swear!
Jogging is about rhythm.\nBattling is about rhythm, too.\rOur rematch is also about rhythm!\c
Emma: We're tough because we battle\ntogether!\c
Emma: Waaah!\n
Emma: That was awesome!\nAre you maybe a Pokémon genius?\rYou're well deserving of respect!\n
We won't talk to people who have only\none Pokémon!\n
Emma: When I battle with Lil,\nwe shouldn't lose!\c
Lil: We're gonna crunch and\nmunch you all up!\c
Lil: Hwaaah!\n
Lil: We're going to be super-strong\nTrainers like you!\cI just decided now!\nPlease cheer for us!\n
We don't talk to people who have only\none Pokémon!\n
Lil: You munched us all up last\ntime, but it's our turn now!\c
Hey, check this out! Look at the\nluster of my Pokémon's fur!\c
Hey, hey, did you take a good look?\n
The Veilstone Department Store is\npretty impressive!\cDid you know they even sell Poffins?\n
I brushed my party a lot.\nSo we'd be ready for a rematch!\c
I'm a rookie breeder, but I'll do\nmy very best!\c
It's all right!\nI'm still a rookie!\n
The best way to raise Pokémon?\c...Hmm, when it comes right down to it,\nisn't it all about love?\n
I can't be a rookie forever.\nI've learned a lot since we last met.\c
                             
           
                                                       
                      
                
                         
                                               
                           
                                
                               
                              
                          
                            
                           
          
                               
                           
        
                                
                                
                
                              
Teri: Yay! We're gonna battle with\nlots of Pokémon!\c
Teri: We tried really hard together,\nbut we lost anyway.\n
Teri: Our mommy is a twin, too.\n
Teri: We want to battle with lots\nof Pokémon.\n
Teri: Yay! We're gonna battle with\nlots of Pokémon again!\c
Tia: Yay!\nWe're all going to battle!\c
Tia: We tried really hard together,\nbut we couldn't win anyway.\n
Tia: When Mommy and Aunty and me\nand Teri get together, it's really\rconfusing and fun!\n
Tia: Um, no.\nWe all want to battle together.\n
Tia: Yay!\nWe're all going to battle again!\c
My Pokémon toughened up while working\non the ranch.\cI'm right proud of them!\c
Hahahah! Your Pokémon sure can be\ncounted on!\n
When I cuddle with my Pokémon, I can\nfeel not just their bodies' warmth, but\rtheir compassion.\n
Whoa! You're that real-tough\nTrainer from before!\cHere are my ranch-toughened Pokémon!\nI'm right proud of them!\c
I'm warmed up and limber.\nI'm OK to battle!\c
...Oh, serious woe.\nI wasn't prepared emotionally for this.\n
I wish I could just run from all this...\nJust joking.\n
I'm going to keep running.\nJust as long as there's a road...\n
I've been training so I can have\na rematch with you.\cI'm OK to battle!\c
Matt: Uhohoho! I'll show y'all how\ntightly I've bonded with my daughter!\c
Matt: Parent-and-child power couldn't\nget the job done.\n
Matt: I reckon the bonds between you\nand your Pokémon are like the bonds\rparents share with their kids.\n
Matt: Oh, there's no way you could\nbeat us both with one Pokémon.\n
Matt: Ayuh? You're here to check the\nbond I have with my daughter again?\c
Ava: I can get away with slacking\noff if I have my Pokémon out!\c
Ava: Oh, sheesh!\n
Ava: Papa, I'm so sorry!\nI'll work harder from tomorrow on!\c...Yup, tomorrow's when I'm going to\nstart working.\n
Ava: You're battling me and my pa.\nOne Pokémon won't cut it, dear!\n
Ava: Oh, hi! It's good y'all came\ncalling on us again!\cI can take a break from work if I'm\nbattling Pokémon. Lucky for me!\c
I am one of the Ninja Trio!\nBeing discovered means I must battle!\c
I concede defeat...\n
My cover is blown, so what should\nI do?\cMaybe I'll go catch some Contests in\nHearthome City. Maybe I'll do that.\n
Do you remember me?\nI am one of the Ninja Trio!\rBeing discovered means I must battle!\c
I am one of the Ninja Trio!\nBeing discovered means I must battle!\c
I concede defeat...\n
While I hid in the tall grass, I\nsensed Pokémon all around me!\cFurtive sounds of movement...\nStifled cries... I heard them!\n
You don't remember me?\nI am one of the Ninja Trio!\rBeing discovered means I must battle!\c
I am one of the Ninja Trio!\nBeing discovered means I must battle!\cBut how did you discover me?\nDon't tell me you're a ninja, too!\c
I concede defeat...\n
A Pokémon Trainer's good at finding\nstuff, I guess.\n
You should join us so we can form\nthe Ninja Quartet!\cAnyway, let's battle!\c
You seem to have a lot of confidence.\nLet's see if it's justified!\c
Haha!\nA total loss for me!\n
You seem to have an abundance of\ntalent. It's pretty amazing.\n
When I lost to you last time, I was\njust unlucky.\c
As an Ace Trainer, I have to take\nbattles in stride.\cI need to stay cool and calm whether\nI win or lose.\c
Aiyeeeeh!\nWe lost!\n
How dare you beat us!\nGo away! Go!\n
Last time, I got a little emotional\nover losing...\cI'll stay cool and calm today!\c
Very well. I've decided.\cI'll battle one last time, with you,\nthen I'm retiring as a Trainer.\c
I've lost, but...\nWhat is this rush I feel?!\n
Yes! This is fun!\nPokémon are fun!\rRetire? Perish that thought!\cI'll become a lot tougher.\nNext time, victory is mine!\n
Your young power against my veteran\ntechnique...\cLet us battle again to see who wins\nthis time!\c
This buff physique isn't just for\nshow!\c
B-but!\nMy buff physique!
Why? Is it because my training isn't\nenough?!\n
My buff physique!\nFeast your eyes on it again!\c
I just startled you!\cWhile you're still struggling to\nrecover, I'll already be the winner!\c
Oh, what's that?\nYou're supposed to be fumbling more.\n
I wanted a better reaction from you.\nNow I feel silly for hiding!\n
You just saw me, and I bet you\nthought, “Long time no see.”\cWhile you're still thinking that, I'll\nalready be the winner!\c
We ninjas appear where you least\nexpect us!\c
I didn't expect to lose...\n
While hiding, I think about what Pokémon\nmust be thinking inside their Poké Balls.\n
Wah! Another chance encounter with\na foe who defeated me before!\c
A ninja can use all kinds of skills.\nLike this and like that!\c
Hmm...\nMy ninja techniques failed to work...\n
There's a ninja Gym Leader somewhere\nfar away.\cI should become a devotee of theirs.\n
What's with you?\nYou're not a ninja yet?\c
Try not to be shocked when you lay your\neyes on my Pokémon!\c
Oh, my...\nGood golly 'n' gosh...\n
A dragon Pokémon's real power is\nnothing like mine!\n
You again?\cYou must really like that dragon\nPokémon I use.\c
I'll teach you about the charms of\nbird Pokémon!\c
Well, that was surprising!\n
The sight of you battling...\nIt was simply a wonder to watch!\n
Are you finally noticing the great\nqualities of bird Pokémon?\c
Zac: Jen, watch this! I'm going to\nuse everything you've taught me!\c
Zac: Wow. Someone that's even\nbetter than Jen...\n
Zac: I don't care if I get to meet\nthe greatest Trainer in the region...\rI'd still rather learn from Jen.\n
Zac: Would you be interested in battling\nthe two of us at the same time?\cWhat I mean is, do you have two or more\nPokémon with you?\n
Zac: This time, I'm not gonna let you\ndown, Jen! I promise!\c
Jen: Here comes a Trainer.\nZac, you ready? Let's do this!\c
Jen: I just got embarrassed in front\nof my little buddy here...\n
Jen: Zac, I'm so sorry.\nI'm a failure as your instructor.\n
Jen: Would you like to have a\ntwo-on-two Pokémon battle with us?\n
Jen: Here comes our Trainer!\nAre you ready this time?\c
Look at these beautiful wings!\c
Oh, you!\nI'm going to peck you for that!\n
There's a bird Pokémon that can learn\nhuman speech! Did you know that?\n
My bird Pokémon has such gorgeous\nwings.\cIt must have been some sort of a\nmistake that we lost last time!\c
                 
                  
              
ZUBAT! Doesn't that sound like a\nninja bursting from cover?\c
Oh!\nMy ZUBAT tristars...\n
Sowing confusion among the foe is\none way a ninja battles.\cA Pokémon can't overcome its\nconfusion unless it switches out.\n
The shinobi live by speed!\nI'll get in my attacks before you do!\c
See how Mt. Coronet towers above us.\nI want to be big like that one day!\c
You loom before me as a giant presence!\n
Mt. Coronet has long been known as\nan ancient and mysterious mountain.\n
Hmm?! \nYou loom before me again?!\cYou're like Mt. Coronet that way!\c
Hah! Hah!\nI'm psyched for this! Here goes!\c
I don't get why we can't win.\n
I don't reminisce over yesterday.\nI don't think about tomorrow.\rI only live today to the fullest.\rThat's my policy!\n
Hiyah! Hiyah! Hiyah! Hiyah!\nThis time, I'm properly psyched!\c
Speed is a ninja's best weapon!\nCan you keep up?\c
I did a lot to conceal myself, too...\n
I'll wait here for a weaker-looking\nTrainer and then ambush them!\n
I became even faster!\nHow can you hope to keep up?\c
I go everywhere with my NOCTOWL.\nWe're gonna show you owl best! Ha!\c
We did our best. That's what\nmatters. Right?\n
Even on cold days, just being with\nmy NOCTOWL keeps me warm!\n
I curled up inside my NOCTOWL's wings\nand waited for you to return!\c
Whilst exploring the ruins, I spotted\na Trainer! I must investigate!\c
My investigation has revealed the\nTrainer to be tough! Ouch...\n
Celestic Town is an old town.\nI'm sure to find something cool.\n
Whilst exploring the ruins, I spotted\nyou again! I will now investigate!\c
My Pokémon sleeps in a bed I got from\noverseas.\cI'm very well off, if you haven't\nnoticed!\c
What? Over already?\nWell, that's fine.\rRich people like me don't fight.\n
Oh, no.\nMy Pokémon is worn out.\cI'd better let it sleep it off in the\nbed I had sent from overseas.\n
I do this only because I love my\nPokémon. Winning isn't that important.\c
I'd like to begin now.\nAre you quite prepared?\c
Oh!\nHow terrible of you...\n
You... You must have one fantastic\nteacher to be so good.\n
We meet again.\nAre you quite prepared?\c
If it pleases you, may I challenge you\nto a battle?\c
Bravo! Your technique is impeccable\nfor someone so young.\n
Hahaha! I was invited by the master of\nthe Pokémon Mansion.\cHe's promised to show me through\nhis prized garden of Pokémon.\n
If it pleases you, would you care for\na rematch with me?\c
I've never battled a young Trainer like\nyourself. It's quite nerve wracking.\c
Oh, dear... That wasn't anything like\nbattling with my friends.\n
Usually, I'll have matches with\nmembers of my social club.\n
Oh, it's you again, dear?\cIt makes me a little nervous to ask,\nbut may I have a rematch?\c
                          
                 
                                                      
Hold it right there, citizen!\nWalking around at night is unsafe!\c
You've got tough partners with you.\nCarry on, citizen. Carry on.\n
Out so late? Does your mother\nknow you're out so late?\n
Well, hello there!\cThat's very civil minded of you to\nsay hello to your local Policeman!\n
Didn't I already give you a warning?\nIt's unsafe to walk around at night!\c
I'm keeping my eyes open for crime.\nAnyone arousing suspicion here?\c
Now, just hold on. I didn't say that\nyou were shady looking!\n
Don't go hanging out with any\nshady-looking characters! You hear?\n
Patrolling night and day sure is\nexhausting... Yawn...\n
Any shady-looking characters around?\nI'm always on the lookout for punks.\cExpecting some shady dude to actually\npop up... Does that make me weird?\c
Let's enjoy a fierce battle in the\nchilly night winds! Brrrr! Refreshing!\c
I need to explain, all right?\nIt was too dark and hard to see.\n
Oops, I'd better get back to my\nbeat before the boss radios me...\n
Yo! Hanging tough, Trainer? Word!\nI'm trying to make my lingo more hip!\n
Still training this late?\cThat makes you either a bad kid or\na good Trainer. Which one is it?\c
Whether there are problems or not, or\nif crimes have been committed or not,\rI still go out on patrol.\c
Big trouble! Officer in need\nof assistance!\n
Your toughness is too much!\nI'm in serious trouble!\n
I don't know how to say this, but\nmaybe we patrol too much.\n
Let me ask you a question!\nAre you tough enough to take me?\c
Can't you see I'm fishing?\nDon't talk! You'll spook the fish!\c
How do you like that?\nBoth my catch and the win got away!\n
Fishing and battling are delicate\nthings--as am I. Is that wrong?\n
You can see I'm fishing, can't you?\nThen don't talk to me! Geez!\c
I wish some fishing-loving lady'd come\nalong. But no, it's all just Trainers.\c
Sure, so I lost.\nBut I'll keep on fishing.\n
If you know of any ladies that like\nfishing, help me reel 'em in!\n
Umm... Yeah. Weren't you that person\nwho preferred Pokémon over fishing?\c
Water Pokémon sure get happy when\nit rains. So do I!\c
Oof. Just got trampled right under\nyour feet that time!\n
Yup, a kid like you should be running\naround outside, rain or shine.\n
I've been fishing here ever since\nI lost to you.\c
Hi, Trainer!\nCan you keep up with me?\c
You've got energy to burn!\n
Even if a battle gets heated, don't\nbreak branches off trees or anything.\n
You're that energetic Trainer!\nI bet you can't keep up this time!\c
Heya, Trainer!\nAre you being good to Mother Nature?\c
Good. You seem to be a kindhearted\nTrainer.\n
Listen, people and Pokémon, we're all a\npart of Mother Nature.\n
Heya, long time!\cAre you enjoying your nature-filled\nadventure with Pokémon?\c
Protect the natural environment.\nThat's what we Rangers do!\c
We've got to get tougher than this...
I love how natural it is here.\nI wish I could live out here.\n
What do you think? The environment\nis unharmed in this area.\c
                   
                             
                                          
                               
                             
       
                                                           
                                          
I find it reassuring to be on this\ndamp soil...\c
Ufufufufu...\nYou had to beat me...\n
It feels good to mope here after a\nloss... Ufufufufu...\n
Is Damp my favorite Pokémon ability?\nFufufu... Anything will do...\c
                             
                
                                   
                            
       
                                 
                  
                           
                             
                           
I'm proud of my Pokémon!\nHere, I'll show you why!\c
Youch! You sure showed me how tough\nyou were.\n
Oh, what have we here?\nThat's a Pokédex!\cIt records Pokémon data upon\nsight? I've never seen one before!\cI heard you can move the sun or\nmoon icon to check the Pokémon\rhabitat map by time of day!\n
I take down details in my notebook\nabout Pokémon I've battled.\cI'll write more data down about your\nPokémon!\c
Oh? Here comes a nice-looking\nTrainer. This is worth evaluation.\c
Our research has arrived at this one\nconclusion: you're a tough one!\n
A huge variety of Pokémon live in the\nGreat Marsh.\cYou see, countless years ago,\nthis whole area was under the sea.\n
Oh, how do you do? May I investigate\nhow much tougher you've become since\rour last encounter?\c
There are Pokémon that grow stronger\nwhen it's raining.\c
Like rain, my tears flow from losing...\nThey call me the Rain Woman...\n
I want to show off my pretty parasol,\nbut it will get dirty in the rain.\cOh, such a big dilemma!\n
On rainy days, I get more energetic!\c
When it rains, I get more tense!\c
It's not very easy trying to battle\nwhile holding an umbrella.\n
If it rained every day, I could have\nmy umbrella open all the time.\n
It's not because it's raining.\nI just love umbrellas!\c
Your whole atmosphere is shady.\nCooperate in this investigation!\c
Defeated by sneakiness...\n
I mistook your toughness as shadiness!\nIt's an honest mistake!\n
We're constantly on patrol.\nThat way, it's safe even at night.\n
Whoa! Hold it right there!\nI've spotted a sneaky Trainer!\c
I swim the whole year round.\nI'm not losing a battle at sea!\c
I lost at sea! But I swim here the\nwhole year round!\n
When you're out at sea, Water-type\nPokémon look more lively.\n
I love the sea. It was only by fluke\nthat I lost last time.\c
Brr... I'm starting to get chilly.\nI could use a win to get warmed up.\c
The chill of the sea, and the\ncoldness of defeat...\cIt's a double whammy.\n
Look at my lips...\nThey're the color of prunes!\n
Brr... I'm starting to feel chilly.\nHow about a hot Pokémon battle?\c
Hi, wave-riding Trainer!\nHow about a battle on the sea?\c
You sure schooled me there.\n
Maybe I should switch to surfing,\ntoo...\n
Hi, we meet again!\nWave-riding Trainer!\c
Hello, there!\nAren't you going to swim?\c
What's saltier?\nMy tears or the sea...\n
There aren't many sea routes that\nyou can swim in Sinnoh.\cIt makes me want to take a vacation\nin the Hoenn region.\n
When I see people surfing, I don't\nfeel jealous or anything.\cI just simply love to swim!\c
Isn't this nice?\nI love my inflatable tube!\c
It's not easy trying to move holding\non to this inflatable tube.\n
Mom blew up my inflatable tube for me.\nI ran out of breath just opening it!\n
You can come back all you like, but\nyou can't have my inflatable tube!\c
Ehehe...\nI can battle, too!\c
Losing made me all hungry now.\n
That cloud looks like giant ice cream!\nI bet it tastes yummy!\n
I've been dawdling here all this\ntime!\c
                
         
                               
Traveling alone, are you? That's\nimpressive! How about we battle?\c
You're good, pip-squeak!\n
Maybe I'll go work out down at the\nrestaurant again.\cThat place gets different people in\nevery day, and they all like battles.\n
Hey, lonesome traveler! Let's break\nthe monotony with another battle!\c
Waah! Now! Just now!\nI was just about to reel it in!\c
You need to have more respect for\na grown-up...\n
Go on. Don't be shy about going up to\npeople to hear what they have to say...\cJust don't you talk to me.\n
Waah! Now! Just now!\nI was just about to reel it in!\c...Right. You again!\c
                             
                       
                                    
                       
                             
                              
                          
                                  
Let me demonstrate my technique.\nIt's how this grown-up battles.\c
Oh, my gosh!\nYou attack that savagely?\n
You're so much more of a Trainer\nthan you look!\n
OK, this time I'll really show you how a\ngrown-up battles!\c
Ah-ha! I found me a Trainer!\cI challenge you to battle with\nthe Pokémon I've found!\c
It's a challenge trying to win with\nPokémon one isn't familiar with...\n
Discovery is the treasure I seek.\nCollecting a lot is my life!\n
Ah-ha! I found me a Trainer!\cI challenge you to battle with\nthe Pokémon I've found!\c
I travel all over the world in search of\nmysteries.\c
Gasp... One more... Gasp...\nIt's like I went on a diet...\n
There are mysteries waiting for me\nto investigate around the world.\cThis is no time to be feeling sorry\nfor myself.\n
There's an endless supply of\nmysteries around the world.\cRunning into you here just happens\nto be one such mystery!\c
                                                       
                
                           
                 
                
                            
                          
                
                        
                     
                        
                               
I'd sensed the presence of a\nTrainer for a while. It was you!\c
Defeating you will be no easy matter.\n
Is it possible to become more\npowerful by understanding Pokémon?\n
I was certain that you'd return.\nI sensed your presence, you see.\c
There!\nBehind you!\c
My plan to spook you didn't go over\nwell at all.\n
You might be tough, but let down\nyour guard at your own risk!\n
Wah!\nThat thing curled around your neck!\c...Nice scarf, kid!\c
When I toss this coin, you call it.\nHeads, we battle.\cTails, we battle!\cNow, how will this play out, my friend?\c
The coin came up tails, and like it, my\nPokémon is facedown...\n
I flipped a coin when I was ten.\nI decided to live in Sinnoh then.\n
Luck wasn't with me last time, but I'm\nfeeling good about this.\rMy lucky coin tells me so!\c
For the sake of my collection, I\ntake on people I know I can't beat.\rThat's what a Collector does.\c
That attack right then was remarkable!\nYou ought to be proud of it!\n
I take pride in having Pokémon that\nothers don't.\cOh, I'm also proud about winning second\nprize in one of Jubilife TV's drawings.\n
For the sake of my collection, I\nkeep battling people I can't beat.\cThat's what a Collector does.\c
What's that?!\cYou say you have a Pokédex?\nAn authentic one!\c
Your Pokédex fills me with such envy,\nenvy, envy...\n
There's all kinds of Trainers with all\nsorts of Pokémon with them.\cThe more you battle, the more your\nPokédex is filled!\n
Ooh, thank you!\cYou came back to show me your Pokédex\nbecause I don't have one!\c
To find my favorite Pokémon, I'll go\neast, west, or any which way!\c
But they're rare Pokémon!\n
If you're trying to find the Pokémon\nyou want, you need to go everywhere!\cNot just east and west, either.\nSouth and north are important, too!
For my favorite Pokémon, I'll go\neast, west, or any which way!\c...Saying that, I've been wandering\naround here all this time.\c
Oh? A little kid like you is going to\nteach me about Pokémon?\c
Wow, is that right?\n
There are so many kinds of Pokémon.\nI can't decide which one to pamper.\n
Yoohoo, little kid! Can you teach me\nsome more about Pokémon?\c
                          
                 
                         
                        
               
                               
                         
                   
                    
                               
                       
                      
                               
                              
                            
                                                      
You come along with your heart\npounding!\cYou think you can win like that?!\nHiyah!\c
Gurgle...\n
If I lose here, I wouldn't stand a\nchance at the Battle Frontier.\cNot against those hard-core pros,\nI wouldn't!\n
Am I lost, you ask?\nI merely feigned it! Hiyah!\c
Check the sharpness of my fighting\nPokémon's moves.\c
You've dulled its sharpness...\n
Back to training for us!\n
I sharpened my Pokémon's moves more\nfor when I saw you again!\c
Every drop of sweat I shed makes\nme that much stronger!\c
I should be lighter by the amount of\nsweat I just shed!\c
It's time for another workout.\nThe more I sweat, the tougher I get!\n
We're going to win this time!\cDon't believe me?\nThen you test it out!\c
Hufff-huff, huff-huff.\nWant-huff a battle-huff?\c
Huff-huff, we-huff lose-huff.\n
Bye-huff now-huff.\nHuff-huff, huff-huff.\n
Running-huff is-huff good-huff.\nOver-huff doing-huff it isn't-huff!\rHuff-huff, huff-huff.\n
Huff-huff, huff-huff.\nWe-huff meet-huff again-huff?\c
I'll take on anyone!\nIt can only make me stronger!\c
You won and I lost, but the both of\nus gained something from this.\n
In a Pokémon battle, it doesn't\nmatter how old or young you are.\cYour gender doesn't matter, either.\nNothing like that means anything!\n
I'll battle against people who've\nbeaten me again and again.\cBy doing that, we both grow a little\nas Trainers.\c
I'm taking the Veilstone Gym\nchallenge. But first...\c
...My confidence is crushed.\n
I think about Pokémon all day long.\nI was confident, you know.\n
Oh, it's you again!\cI've regained my confidence.\nLet's have another battle!\c
I'm a treasure hunter.\cToday, the loot is a victory from\nyou!\c
I can't win.\nYou're too strong for me to win.\n
If one's after treasures, maybe the\nUnderground is the better choice.\n
I'm a treasure hunter.\cThis time for sure, the loot is\nvictory over you!\c
If I battle now, won't it mess up my\nusual pace?\c
My pace is completely off...\n
Sticking to one's own goal is more\nimportant than it seems.\cIf you match your goal with someone\nelse, you'll lose your identity.\n
Well, yes, sometimes I do walk.\nI even stop on occasion.\cI am human, after all.\n
Up till now, I'd maintained my pace.\nBut seeing you threw me off!\c
                        
                              
                       
I'm an elite battler, but cold is\nmy nemesis!\c
But, how...?\nAm I weak at battling, too?\n
I'd rather be asleep in the lodge's\nbed...\cI can't take this cold...\n
I'm an elite at battling, but cold is\nmy nemesis!\c
I always play for keeps!\nThis isn't practice!\c
Good job!\nThat was an excellent battle.\n
If you don't play for keeps, you'll\nlose battles you should be dominating.\n
When I lost to you last time, I was\nbattling for keeps.\cBut this time, I really mean it.\nThis is seriously for keeps!\c
I'm fully kitted up and equipped!\nAnytime will be fine!\c
Hunh?!\n
Perhaps I should maybe change into\na more comfy outfit...\n
I'm fully equipped again today!\nAnytime you're ready will be fine!\c
To be ready to answer any call!\nTo be ready to accept any challenge!\cThat is the way of a Trainer!\c
Oh, yeah?\nEat snowball, punk!\n
You can make all the preparations in\nthe world, but if it doesn't work, it\rdoesn't work.\n
I got everything ready so we could\nhave a rematch whenever you come.\c
I'm skiing right now, but OK.\nAs we Skiers say, “Spur thing!”\c
...I've hit an ice patch!\n
I quite enjoyed that battle!\nLet us meet again. Slalom!\n
We might get snowbound, but why not?\nIt's on the “spur” of the moment!\c
Are you a novice?\nOr around midlevel?\c
I never expected you to be an\nexpert...\n
You know how to play your Pokémon\nwith an edge!\n
Knowing you to be an expert,\nI challenge you to a rematch!\c
The fun things about winter!\nOne, skiing! Two, Pokémon!\c
Snivel...
If it was skiing, I wouldn't lose.\nI should go ski with my Pokémon...\n
You're a better Trainer than a skier.\nBut I'll challenge you again anyway!\c
How do you expect to battle in this\nheavy snow?\c
The winds of victory shifted...\n
It's so cold here, but here you are,\nso full of energy.\cI guess you kids are made tougher\nthan people my age.\n
Why would you wander around here?\nYou must really like this area.\c
I can withstand this cold. That means\nI can take any kind of attack!\c
Huh? It's over, you say?\n
Oh, gosh, this is bad! I think I'm\nlosing feeling all over my body!\n
Oh? I've seen your face before.\nWhat say we battle?\c
This cold is but nothing compared\nto the fire that burns in my heart!\c
Your heart burns as hot as mine!\n
The weather clears up sometimes.\nThe view is breathtaking then.\n
We'll come at you with our hearts\nablaze!\c
Wh-what is it?\nP-Pokémon battle?!\c
Whew...\nYou are alive, aren't you?\n
Around these parts, perhaps because\nof all the snow, there are many\rfolktales of hauntings...\n
This isn't like last time. See how\nmuch I've trained since then!\c
I'll show you the techniques I had\ndrummed into me at ski school!\c
I don't believe it...\nMy techniques were rebuffed...\n
Maybe I should've studied at the\nTrainers' school instead...\n
Since I lost to you last time,\nI redid my training at ski school!\c
We Skiers feel Mother Nature through\nthe soles of our feet!\c
I got a good taste of your power!\n
Trainers get an appreciation of life\nthrough Pokémon. At least I think so.\n
I knew you were headed here.\nI felt it with the soles of my feet!\c
I've been skiing with Pokémon since\nI was just five years old.\c
Hunh, what...?\nI repeat, hunh, what...?\n
The scenery doesn't change very much\naround here. Don't go getting lost!\n
Oh... Did you maybe get lost again?\nYou should pay more attention!\c
Rainy days make me feel blue...\cBut the instant it starts to snow,\nI'm as happy as can be!\c
The conditions weren't very good.\n
Can any of your Pokémon use that\nhidden move to climb cliffs?\n
You really must like snow.\cAfter all, if you didn't, I doubt that\nyou'd come here so often!\c
Poof!\cYou've got a good eye spotting me!\c
You also saw through my weak\nspots...\n
I'll play with my Pokémon--even in a\nblizzard!\n
Poof!\cYou saw through my camouflage again!\c
There are several clans of ninjas.\nAre you from the Iga clan? Or Kouga?\c
I'm not much of a ninja either way...\n
I wonder why everyone stops being\na ninja when they grow up?\n
I forged my willpower in the snow!\nWitness my snowy might!\c
I dress light wherever I go.\nHiyah!\c
Achoo!\n
Maybe I'll dress warm and come back.\nHiyah!\n
Lightly dressed like always.\nHiyah!\c
                              
       
                    
                                
         
                 
                                           
         
                          
                                    
            
                       
Yeah, yeah...\nNothing's biting!\c
Can't catch a fish!\nCan't catch a break!\n
I was counting on strength in numbers,\nbut...\cPacking it in and going home sounds good\nat a time like this...\n
Yeah, yeah...\nNothing's biting today either.\c
                                   
     
                  
                                             
                                 
     
              
                
Outdoor fishing for the win!\cShouting doesn't help my fishing any,\nbut shout I must!\c
Gwaaah!\nThis is hurting!\n
Oh, right... My shouting is scaring\naway the Pokémon.\n
Super outdoor fishing!\nShouting still doesn't help!\c
Let it rock!\nIt's the rhythm of battle!\c
Can you hear it?\nThat's my guitar weeping...\n
I'm too torn up to sing anymore...\nI am so cool that way...\n
Rock 'n' roll!\nWe'll beat it out again!\rOur rhythm of battle!\c
A man of the sea is also a man of\nPokémon!\c
Anchors away!\n
You've got what it takes to be\na Trainer among Trainers!\n
Hard to starboard!\nThat's a sharp turn to the right!\cHard to port!\nAnd that's a sharp turn to the left!\c
                 
                          
                               
                                         
              
                               
                      
       
                          
I love my inflatable tube.\nSo I admire jellyfish Pokémon!\c
I'm drifting away...\n
I wish Professor Rowan would\ngive me a Pokédex.\cBut that old guy looks kind of\nscary.\n
I love my inflatable tube.\nSo I admire jellyfish Pokémon.\cWon't you hang out with us and just\nbob around on the waves?\c
I can't swim without my inflatable tube.\nBut my Pokémon might be strong!\c
They weren't tough, my Pokémon...\n
My mommy said that Professor Rowan\nis really kindhearted.
Oh! You're the Trainer who played\nwith us before!\cCan you see if my Pokémon have grown\nstronger?\c
I only live to swim. Teach me what's\nso fun about Pokémon!\c
Oh, yeah, that was fun!\nI learned something good!\n
It's what I live for!\nPokémon!\n
Hey, didn't you teach me what's so fun\nabout Pokémon?\cTeach me more.\nI'm eager to learn!\c
On your marks, get set, go!\c...When I say that, let's start.\c
Yow-ow-ow-ow!\nMy leg's cramped up!\n
I forgot to do my stretching\nexercises...\n
Hi, I was waiting for you!\nReady? On your marks, get set...\c
OK! Get your breathing in order!\nOK! You're ready to go!\c
I let my momentum falter...\n
Listen, I have something important to\nsay to you.\cDon't drown in your own talent.\n
OK! You're ready to go!\nThis time, I'm going for the win!\c
Swimming is a workout for your entire\nbody.\cJump in and swim!\nSwim, you!\c
Sunk like a stone!\n
Well, Pokémon's one thing, but you\nshould take up swimming, too!\n
Hiya, Pokémon-riding Trainer!\nYou should be swimming like me!\c
The human body floats more easily in\nthe sea, so it's easy to swim!\c
The sea is salty, but all I taste is\nbitterness...\n
I've got that sinking feeling...\n
Pokémon can stay afloat even while\ncarrying someone. That's so cool!\c
I may not look it now, but I'm a\nstar. I'm always with my Pokémon.\c
I lost, but at least I had fun.\n
If it were an underwater Pokémon\nshow, I would have shined.\n
Oh, hi! Are you back to see our\nPokémon show again?\c
I bought a new bikini!\nIt's this year's newest model!\c
Psssssh!\n
I bought the wrong size of bikini.\nIt's a little too snug...\n
Did I show you already?\nMy bikini, new for this year!\c
                              
                  
                             
                               
                     
              
                
                 
Well? Does it look like I'm swimming\ngracefully?\c
I'm finally feeling fatigued...\n
I may look like I'm swimming\ngracefully, but beneath the surface\rI'm kicking furiously.\n
You were attracted by my graceful\nswimming again, weren't you?\c
One thing about Water-type Pokémon:\nThere's a huge variety!\cI'll show you the Water-type Pokémon I\nchose and why I'm so proud of them!\c
I can't boast when I lose...\nI'm so disappointed...\n
Sure I lost, but watch me! I'll get\ntougher with water Pokémon.\n
This time, my water Pokémon will show\nyou why I'm so proud of them!\c
I like fishing, no question.\nBut battling? That's what I love!\c
Sploosh!\n
If you don't know how to fish, you're\nmissing half of life's enjoyment.\cIf you don't know Pokémon...\nYou're missing out on all of it!\n
Come on, battle me again!\nYou know I love to fish and battle!\c
                                
        
                                   
They call me an Ace Trainer.\cAllow me to demonstrate the talent\nthat makes me so!\c
I'm burning with jealousy over your\nraw talent!\n
I think keeping up the effort to\nbetter yourself is a talent in itself.\n
Last time, I stumbled before I could\nshowcase my talent.\cThis time, I'll conclusively demonstrate\nthe might of an Ace Trainer!\c
Really? So you think you can beat me?\nI'm an Ace Trainer, you do realize?\c
I admit defeat...\n
Beaten in battle, but not in spirit.\nThat's the mark of a real Ace Trainer.\n
Ace Trainers always work to improve\ntheir natural-born talents.\c
Are you going to the Pal Park, too?\cFor you, I'm willing to show off my\nprized Pokémon!\c
So? Hot stuff, huh?\nThat's why I'm so proud of my Pokémon!\n
Pal Park, huh? I wonder what kinds\nof Pokémon you can see there?\n
Listen, did you go to the Pal Park?\nWhat was it like? What was it like?\c
Well, I am fishing, but...\cVery well!\nI accept your challenge!\c
A bittersweet smile is on my lips.\n
I've gone down in defeat.\nWhatever more is there to say?\n
Well, just as before, I'm fishing, but...\cVery well!\nI accept your challenge!\c
Hi, traveler!\nHow would you like to battle?\c
You've bested this fisherman traveler.\n
I like to fish.\nYou're a traveler.\cFarewell, until we meet again!\n
Hi, traveler!\cI've forgotten your name, but we've\nbattled before, haven't we?\c
I'm getting bored of fishing.\nLet's have a quick battle!\c
I've been done in...\n
Thanks for that!\nIt was a good change of pace for me.\n
Yo! I remember how our battle was a\ngood change of pace before.\cLet's have another quick battle!\c
If I stare at the water's surface\nfor too long, I begin to forget what\rI was doing in the first place.\c
I don't know how, but I lost!\n
Oh, right...\nI was fishing, wasn't I?\n
When I looked up from staring at the\nwater's surface, I saw your face.\cI'm not sure about what I was just\ndoing, but do you want to battle?\c
                    
    
                
                
      
                 
                                                                      
                       
                                                        
                                 
     
                               
My dream's a big one!\cI want to battle every kind of Pokémon\nfrom around the world!\c
I lost, but I am one step closer to\nrealizing my dream!\n
Listen, you! Whatever happens, never\nlose sight of your dream!\n
All right, you!\cHelp me realize my dream of battling\nevery kind of Pokémon there is!\c
Oh, we'll ride upon the sea,\nin a boat, just you and me!\cThat's the way of the Sailor!\nWay of the Sailor. Sing it!\c
Your Pokémon...\nThey're looking good!\n
You ought to think about becoming\na Sailor yourself.\cIt's been great to be able to visit\ndifferent places around the world.\n
Oh, we'll ride upon the sea,\nin a boat, just you and me!\cThat's the way of the Sailor!\nWay of the Sailor. You sing, too!\c
Who's there?!\nWhat do you think you're doing?!\c
I happen to be rather jumpy, so\neveryone looks suspicious to me.\n
I'm easy to scare, and yet here I am\non patrol. Funny how things go.\n
At night, I get tense and nervous.\nI don't know why.\n
I'll repeat myself! Who's there?!\nWhat do you think you're doing?!\c
I need to escape these doldrums...\nYou can keep me company.\c
That did liberate me from the doldrums,\nbut at what price...\n\n
I'm going back to the hotel to rest!\nI find you exceedingly tiresome!\n
I'm afraid I'm in the doldrums again.\nYou shall keep me company again!\c
                                 
            
                                             
                                
                       
                               
After enjoying a meal at the hotel\nrestaurant, one has a battle.\cThat's the social etiquette.\c
Enchanting.\n
Personally, I would much rather pamper\nPokémon than make them battle.\n
I only seem to run into you after\nI go to the restaurant.\cEtiquette calls for a battle after a\nmeal. Shall we?\c
Look, look! Look at my Pokémon!\nIt's really cool!\c
Wowee! I had to hold on tight to\nmy inflatable tube!\n
Pools are OK, but I like the sea\nbecause Pokémon live there.\n
Yay! You came to see my Pokémon\nagain, right? Look, look!\c
Listen, listen! Can you tell me what\nkind of Pokémon you have?\c
You're so tough. I'm stunned...\n
I want to hang on to a BUIZEL and\njust bob around.\n
Listen, listen! Did you find any new\nkinds of Pokémon?\c
                          
           
                               
                            
                
                   
                                 
                 
                 
                  
                           
I came out here because I wanted to\nsee the Pokémon League for myself.\c
I'm shocked...\nNo, really, I am.\n
The way I battle now, well, I can\nonly look at the Pokémon League!\cYou, go on! You go to the Pokémon\nLeague for me, too!\n
I've been training here in hopes of\ngoing to the Pokémon League.\c
I've decided!\nI'm off to the Pokémon League if I win!\c
Blblblblugh...\n
It's OK. Just let me float away\nlike driftwood...\n
This is it! I'm going to beat you, then\nI'm off to the Pokémon League!\c
It might not look like it, but I'm\ntraveling now.\c
You've got the upper hand on me.\n
But you can be sure that there will\nbe bigger challenges in front of you.\cGo! Go as far as you can! You alone can\nbroaden your horizons.\n
I'm still on my journey...\nLet's have a battle!\c
The sea around these parts is harsh.\nAs am I!\c
The world is so harsh...\n
What? You've got that many Gym\nBadges? No wonder you're so tough...\n
It's me again! The harsh sea here\nshould have toughened me up more!\c
To swim every sea there is...\nThat's my dream!\c
Boo!\nI'm not done with my dream!\n
What is the sea like in places like the\nKanto and Hoenn regions?\n
Challenging every Pokémon League...\nThat's another of my dreams!\c
Yes, I know I can surf, but I'd\nrather swim instead.\cIt does seem weird, I agree.\c
Kaploosh!\n
If you don't know how, I'm willing to\nshow you how to swim.\n
If you rely on your Pokémon all the\ntime, you'll never learn how to swim!\c
I train at a Pokémon Gym, too.\cDon't think you're going to win\neasily!\c
Master Wake...\nI mean, Crasher Wake, sorry!\n
What to do... Train at the Gym again,\nor train by myself...\n
I trained at the Gym after you beat\nme. Let's do it, gang!\c
I'm determined to go to the Pokémon\nLeague, no matter how hard it is.\c
Th-this is so hard...\n
Losing won't make me quit.\nI mean, this is my dream!\cThe Pokémon League isn't going\nanywhere, either.\n
It doesn't matter how long it takes,\nI'm going to the Pokémon League!\c
Excuse me for wearing my bikini!\c
Was I multitasking too much, battling\nand swimming at the same time?\n
When I'm in my bikini, I'm at a loss\nabout where to carry my Poké Balls!\n
Giggle...\nExcuse me for wearing my bikini!\c
Deep breathing before battle!\nBreathe in...and out!\c
Breathe in...and out.\nBreathe in...and out!\n
Deep breathing after battle, too!\nBreathe in...and out!\n
Deep breathing always!\nBreathe in...and out!\c
Your Pokémon doesn't seem to be tiring\nat all from carrying you on its back.\cLet me see how strong it is!\c
I can't take any more...\nI'm all tired out!\n
While floating here, I think about\neverything and nothing.\cLike how I should battle next, and\nwhat's for dinner tomorrow, and...\n
How much stronger have your Pokémon\nbecome?\cLet me check 'em out, OK?\c
Did you know, I was crowned the\nchampion of a swimsuit contest!\cSo now, I'm trying to win a title\nat a Pokémon Contest!\c
I'm speechless!\nI never lose when I'm in my swimsuit!\n
I shouldn't be worried about what bikini\nto wear.\cThe first thing to do is consider what\nPokémon I should be using!\n
I'm so wonderful, I won a swimsuit\ncontest.\cI'm going to take you on so that I can\nwin a Pokémon Contest!\c
My favorite kind of guy is someone\nthat looks good out on the open sea!\c
The tide is going out...\n
Don't get me wrong, it's not as if I\ndon't like mountain men.\cBut, you know, my most favorite kind of\nguy looks great with Pokémon!\n
Hello again! You're that Trainer who\nlooks keen with your Pokémon!\c
Fine, all righty then.\nJust a quick battle on my break!\c
Wahaha!\nMercy, I cry mercy!\n
I'd better get on back to work...\cYou know, I'd rather be traveling\naround with Pokémon the way you do.\n
I'm gonna let you in on a secret...\nI snuck my Pokémon to work!\c
Well, now aren't you something!\n
OK, OK, time for work! I'll work up\na thirst with my Pokémon!\n
                           
              
                 
                           
                
                           
                                 
           
                               
                                                
                          
                         
What's cool, you might ask? No?\nI'll tell you anyway: bug Pokémon!\c
Don't ignore bug Pokémon!\nThat really bugs me!\n
It would seem that coolness alone\ndoesn't add up to any wins...\n
Here comes the swarm!\c
Whoooh...\n
There's a Pokémon ability named Swarm.\n
My senses tingle...\nI've spotted a rare Pokémon!\c
Awawawawah...\n
I thought it was a rare Pokémon, but\nit turned out to be just a Trainer!\n
We're just out on a power walk!\c
Oh, you!\n
You can't avoid bug Pokémon ever in\nthe forest.\cI didn't have any Antidotes with me,\neither. It was the worst!\n
When a Trainer and a Pokémon bond\nas one, a wondrous power is born...\c
Urmmm...\nUrrrrmmmmm...\n
There still remain many mysteries yet\nto be solved in this strange world...\n
A strange presence has been felt...\nIt is emanating from...you!\c
Oh, no!\nMy MEDITITE!
The Old Chateau... I sense...\na particularly strong presence there.
I see it...\nI see it...\cI see you going down in defeat...\c
It is I that has gone down in defeat.
The Old Chateau...\nThere should be none alive in it...\cAnd yet there is a pervasive sense of\na presence...
This forest is strange, you know...\nIt seems to fill me with energy...\c
Your victory...\nThere is nothing strange about it.
Forests are mystifying... They seem\nto gather such unexplainable energy.
                         
               
                               
                                  
                            
                 
                             
                                  
                        
                 
                                                
                  
                 
                                           
                              
               
                                 
                             
            
                   
                                
                
                            
                                             
                
                
                                 
            
                        
                                       
               
                                 
                                                 
                  
                      
                           
        
                                   
                                               
               
                                   
                                                           
              
                                
                  
               
                            
                  
             
                          
                             
    
            
                                   
              
                                        
                         
                             
               
               
                  
You... One look at you tells me\nyou're a real contender!\c
You're as tough as you look.
One day, people will run to the other\nside of the road when I walk by 'em.\cIt's a goal of mine I'm working on.
Victory Road... Somehow, it feels as\nif my journey is now coming to an end.\cBut, before the final chapter is\nwritten, I must pen your defeat!\c
That wasn't how I planned the final\nchapter to go in my writing class...
If you don't give up, you can reach\nyour goal.\cThat perseverance is what's important\nto Trainers. That's in my book, too.
Show me how you've battled to get\nhere! Let's do this!\c
So, that's how you battled...?\n
Once you emerge from Victory Road,\nthe Pokémon League lies directly\rahead...\cBut many Trainers fail to ever find\ntheir way on Victory Road...\n
This total stranger'll be a good way\nto see if I have what it takes to own\rthe Pokémon League's Elite Four!\c
That battle just now must make you\ntougher than everyone in the world.\n
It doesn't appear as if anyone could\neven try to stand against your might.\cThe Elite Four should just surrender.
I can sense that your Pokémon have\na lot of trust in you.\cYou and your Pokémon...\nYou seem to be aglow.\c
Ah, I understand it now!\n
Neither Pokémon nor people live\nforever.\cBut it is the very frailty of life that\nallows us to shine!
Let me see how well your Pokémon can\nbattle!\c
Brilliant!\n
Rather than navigating Victory Road,\nI have a much better time putting\ryoung Trainers like you to the test.\n
I take Pokémon that are tough to begin\nwith and toughen them up even more.\cYou can help me!\c
There's no way I could have won!\n
How should I teach the most powerful\nof the Dragon-type moves...?\n
This is a place where tough Trainers\nnaturally congregate.\cIt's ideal for training!\c
That's why I like it here; I get to\nbattle tough characters like you.\n
When two roads diverge, you must\nchoose the path less traveled...\n
My Pokémon knows karate!\nI'm warning you, it's a tough one!\c
I've met my match in strength!\n
I've made it this far in life using the\nkarate I learned on the Internet!\n
I keep battling so I can soar\never higher into the skies!\c
It seems I've been grounded...\n
The wings of freedom...\cI know I'll find them if I can win\nmy way through the Pokémon League...\n
I am a Psychic!\nI can see your future!\c
So be it! I will now divulge what\nI know of your future... Hmm!\n
I see it now!\cYou will battle the Elite Four of the\nPokémon League!\n
I am a Psychic!\nI can see your past!\c
Your past...\nYou've been through a lot...\n
Let me guess.\nHave you met any legendary Pokémon?\n
Pat: It's a doubles team of aces!\nWe're gonna overwhelm you!\c
Pat: You and your Pokémon will gain\npower by helping each other out.\n
Pat: The combination of you and\nyour awesome Pokémon...\cIt's the ultimate tag team!\n
Pat: If you don't mind, we're hoping\nfor some two-on-two battle action.\n
Jo: We form a combination that's\nin perfect sync!\cHow do you expect to counter that?\c
Jo: You and your Pokémon make\na beautiful combination!\n
Jo: Yup, the way you battle is\nfantastic!\cYou should try to take the Elite Four\nright now--not later!\n
Jo: We want to have a battle\nwithout an advantage.\cPlease come back when you have\nat least two Pokémon!\n
Al: I intend to perfect my Double\nBattle technique.\cThat will make me better all around.\c
Al: You! You're an expert\ndouble battler, too!\n
Al: Your mastery over several\nPokémon at once...\cYou're a remarkable Trainer!\n
Al: You have but one Pokémon?\cI would say that you are taking\nVictory Road too lightly, kid.\n
Kay: I want to improve my doubles\ntechnique as much as I can.\cThat will improve me as a Trainer.\c
Kay: My goodness!\nYou're great at doubles, too!
Kay: Depending on the combinations,\nevery kind of Pokémon can excel.\cAt least, that's what I think.\n
Kay: You're really going through\nVictory Road with only one Pokémon?\n
We Trainers will accept challenges\nanywhere! It's what we do.\c
Hmm...\nInsufficiently raised?\n
Pokémon can appear anywhere in a cave.\nIt's not like the tall grass by roads.\n
To celebrate my getting through this\ncave, I'm going to battle you!\c
Well, I guess losing is something\nto commemorate, too...\n
Getting through that cave feels\nlike an adventure.\n
I'm a Veteran, yes, but don't you\ndare treat me like a senior citizen!\c
Grrr...\nSo young, and yet so talented!\n
I'll always remain young at heart.\nNever let them say you're too old!\n
                                                       
          
                        
                                         
              
                                        
                         
               
               
Oh, what's this? My last one!\nThis is where we make our stand!\c
We're not done yet!\nThere's no giving up!\n
Hmm!\nMy sturdy Pokémon, defeated!\n
Aiyaah! We're coming out swinging\nwith super-heavy judo chops!\c
That was...\nA complete trashing!\n
I must rededicate myself to training.\nThe road extends into infinity...\n
Up and down you go on the lifts.\nMe? I like to battle!\c
You've got me feeling down!\n
I can't keep this up!\nI'll go back to working on the lifts.\n
A Pokémon Gym isn't only about seeing\nhow tough your Pokémon happen to be.\cIt's so much deeper than just that.\nIt's a test of you as a person.\c
That move was devastating!\n
I get to work all day with my\nPokémon, and even battle sometimes.\cI get all the fun I need every day!
An ace has the knowledge and\nexperience of battling at high levels.\cI'll demonstrate what that means to\na noob like you!\c
Wow...\nI'm in the mood to sing a lullaby...\n
Your earnest enthusiasm...\nI guess that kinda makes you an ace.\cMaybe you're a Trainer who has the\npotential to surpass aces!\n
By focusing on only one type, you can\nreally see the strengths and\rweaknesses of that Pokémon.\c
My focus was too narrow minded...
Start by becoming friendly with your\nPokémon. I mean really friendly.\cIf you do that, you'll learn naturally\nhow you should battle with it.\n
Steel represents an unbending spirit!\cIf one refuses to accept defeat,\nthe path to victory reveals itself!\c
I never gave up, but still I failed to\nwin...\n
If you give up, well, that's when\neverything ends for you!\n
Pokémon and people have worked\ntogether for many years.\cLet us show you an example of that\nhistory!\c
A spectacular loss!\nBut it's still a loss!\n
The way you helped each other...\nThat is what made you prevail!\n
What do you think you're doing to my\nPokémon?!
This can't be?! I lost?!\nYou...you uppity brat!\n
Oi! This is no fun and games!\nThis is proper work, I tell you!\c
What...?!\nSome brat messed up my job...\n
Team Galactic needs electricity for\ndoing something big!\n
Collecting electricity from the Valley\nWindworks... That's our mission.\c
I really don't like kids who also\nhappen to be tough Trainers...\n
You don't have an inkling of what\nTeam Galactic is trying to achieve!\cOf course, they don't tell a grunt\nlike me anything, either... But still!\n
...This is why I'm gonna be stuck as\na grunt forever...\n
...I want a promotion so I can get some\ntougher Pokémon...\n
Don't get cocky!\nThis isn't over yet!\n
My Pokémon's getting low on HP...\nThings could be tight here.\n
What just happened?\nI lost?!\n
Don't get cocky!\nThis isn't over yet!\n
My Pokémon's getting low on HP...\nThings could be tight here.\n
What just happened?\nI lost?!\n
We were having a heated discussion\nover Pokémon the way Collectors do.\c
Knowledge alone isn't everything,\nyou know...\n
I'm more knowledgeable than anyone\nelse!\cI have a rare Pokémon!\cBut, I'm weak at battling...\nThat's a Pokémon Collector for you...
I'm a Collector, and I love Honey!\c
What've you done to my Pokémon?!\cIt took me forever to catch it using\nHoney!\n
I went through a lot of bother to catch\nmy Pokémon.\cBut since I've not raised it, it's\nas weak as when I caught it.\n
Welcome!\nThis place is my pride and joy!\c
I take losses with an unusually big\nsmile! Do you find that odd at all?\n
After a match, you should have some\nMoomoo Milk to quench your thirst!\cJust chug it right down! Glug glug!\n
                                                                   
                   
                              
                                                                
                   
                                 
                                                                  
                   
                                   
                            
                 
                   
                                 
                   
                  
It's not the end yet.
Are you saying something?\nYou think you have me cornered?\n
Amazing!\nYou're very good, aren't you?\n
Giggle! You found me!\nOf course, let's battle!\c
Aww, boo!\nLook, you've beaten me!\n
Giggle! There's only our Gym Leader\nleft. Go on, don't be afraid!\n
A forest inside a Gym...\nShocking, isn't it?\c
Giggle...\nThe clock will turn now.\n
OK, the next Trainer is at the end,\npast two boulders.\n
My Grass-type Pokémon can dole out\nspecial attacks...\cI won't let you win easily!\c
The more beautiful a flower,\nthe faster it withers...\n
Oh, that's right...\nA hint about the next Trainer...\cIn the middle of three trees.\nThat's my hint. Good luck.\n
Even concealed, there is no hiding\nthe aroma of flowers.\c
Just like your inability to conceal\nyour abundant skill.\n
Your next opponent is under four\nflowers.\n
Hey! That there!\nThat was a good move!\n
This is where it gets exciting!\n
Hunwah!\nIt's gone and ended!\cHow will I say this... I want more!\nI wanted to battle a lot more!\n
I've landed the most fish Pokémon\nin the world. I'm next!\c
Being number one in the world doesn't\nmean a thing...\n
I figure I got too wrapped up in\nfishing and neglected training.\n
I wield the stupendous power of water!\nDon't think you can win!\c
But the kid wins anyway!\nI'm just bowled over!\n
The water rising and falling is tricky,\nbut don't let it annoy you.\cIf you lose sight of yourself, that's\nwhen you're set to lose.\n
I've been around the world, going from\nplace to place training Pokémon.\cIt's this Gym I've chosen to make my\nhome!\cYou can bet it's tough!\c
You!\nYou're truly top-class tough!\n
If you were to go around the world,\nI'm sure you'd meet tougher Pokémon.\n
Like the raging sea, I crash down\nand wash away everything before me!\cThat's just how I roll!\c
That wave didn't even wash\nmy hands...\n
I'm now becalmed like a waveless\nsea...\n
My body isn't the only thing I\nwork on toughening up here.\cI also work on my Pokémon and my\nspirit!\c
Wow, Trainer! You just might be\ntougher than our Gym Leader!\n
Maybe I'll do like Wake,\cI mean, Crasher Wake, and wear\nthe same kind of mask.\n
I want to become a strong Trainer\nlike Crasher Wake!\c
Groan...\nYou're too much.\n
Maybe I'll do like Wake...\cI mean, Crasher Wake, and use\nthe same kinds of Pokémon.\n
                                              
                     
                           
                                
      
                                  
                                                              
                           
                              
                                  
                      
                                 
Oh!\nBut this isn't the end, my friend!\n
I'm in a bit of a bind, aren't I?\n
I shall admit defeat...\nYou are much too strong.\n
We're the Karate Quads!\cI will strike a blow for love with my\nfist! Hiyah, looooooooove!\c
Argh! Crunched!\n
Your Pokémon sure are tough!\cBut our Gym Leader Maylene will\nbreak you like a stack of bricks!\n
We're the Karate Quads!\cI will strike a blow for courage with\nmy fist! Hiyah, couraaaaaaaaaaage!\c
I couldn't force my way to victory...\n
To overwhelm by force...\nThat is my ideal beat-down style.\cIt doesn't seem to work that way\nwith Pokémon, however.\n
We're the Karate Quads!\cI will strike a blow for hope with my\nfist! Hiyah, hoooooooooooooope!\c
We came up short, but not by much.\n
I'll have to redo my training, though.\nMaylene's gonna trample me again...\n
We're the Karate Quads!\cI will strike a blow for tears with\nmy fist! Hiyah, teeeeeeaaaaaaaaars!\c
I'm so hungry, kid...\nI don't have any strength left...\n
I lost because I didn't eat\nenough pizza.\c...No. Anything I say will sound\nlike I'm making excuses.
Oh, heavens. What is this?\nIs this my final Pokémon?\n
Never give up, never surrender!\n
You are so fantastically strong.\nI know now why I have lost.\n
I've been to all sorts of places.\nThat means I know tons of things!\c
Yeah, whatever.\nYou can battle, too...\n
I'm gonna visit new places and find\nnew Pokémon so I'll be a know-it-all!\n
What, were you just dawdling around\nhoping I'd notice you for a battle?\cYou know you're going to get whupped\nhere, don't you?\c
I kinda deserved that, didn't I?\nI gotta stop mouthing off like that...\n
I'll remember you and your shifty\nPokémon, too. I'm watching you...\n
What does it feel like, taking one step\nafter another into darkness?\c
You're the kind of person who can keep\ngoing forward even into the unknown.\n
I think, sometimes, one has to make\nmistakes to learn what is right.\n
Boo! Did I scare you?\nThis battle will!\c
Uh, whoopsie!\nThat didn't end well!\n
Since you're here, you might as well\ntake on every Trainer.\n
I'm not afraid of picnicking anywhere,\nso I've learned all sorts of things.\c
Your toughness...\nIt's something new to me.
I've learned that Pokémon are fun\n'cause everyone plays with 'em!\n
Are you lost?\nAre you enjoying yourself?\c
Let me guess.\nYou are enjoying yourself.\n
Whatever happens in life, it's better to\ntry to enjoy it the best one can.\cBeing in the dark here, I came to\nrealize that.\n
Eek! That's so bright!\cSurprise attack!\c
Your strength is dazzling!\nI have to shield my eyes!\n
I'm going over the reasons why I\nlost. That way, I'll win next time.\n
Hey, now!\nYou're not even close to the door yet.\cYou have to beat me before you can\ngo, you know?\c
Argh! I should've dazzled you by\nshining my light in your eyes!\n
Just walk around and look for the blue\nmarks on the tiles.\n
I'm going to break the ice and bring\nout my last-resort Pokémon!\n
I can sense your will to win, but I\npromise you I'm not about to lose!\n
I must say, I've warmed up to you!\nI might even admire you a little.\n
...It's t-too cold.\nI can't even feel my t-tongue.\c
This result...\n...It's cold. Bitter cold.\n
The higher up you slide from, the\nmore speed you'll have to smash\rthose big snowballs.\n
My willpower was shaped and tempered\nby howling blizzards.\cI'll bring it to bear on you!\c
You weren't even fazed...\n
I've battled countless Trainers\nand many more Pokémon still.\cMy spirit has been hardened from all\nthe battles I have fought.
Is the Gym's trick floor making you\na little hot under the collar?\cIf you can't maintain your cool in\nbattle, you'll freeze up.\c
You were surprisingly cool...\nAt least I have my warm boots.\n
Your Pokémon look so hot in battle.\nSo hot, they're cool! Hahah!
Are you feeling all run-down?\cBut a good Trainer is one who wins no\nmatter the situation!\c
That's right. A good Trainer will win,\nno matter what the situation may be.\n
The Trainer's feelings...\nThe Pokémon's feelings...\cIf they are one and the same, you\nwill never lose.\n
                                 
                     
                           
                                             
         
                                                                   
I get it! You guys are tough!\nBut we can match your toughness!\n
This is it!\nMy trump card!\n
Shocking... I didn't see this coming!\n
You've got me beat...\cYour desire and the noble way\nyour Pokémon battled for you...\cI even felt thrilled during our\nmatch.\cThat was a very good battle.\n
Wow! I'm surprised you've come this\nfar, but you'll have to turn back.\cThere isn't any chance that you\ncould ever beat me!\c
What makes your Pokémon\nso special?\n
As a challenger, you're one tough\nTrainer.\n
I'm not just looking for tough\nTrainers to battle.\cI've been battling here because\nI want to feel the rush!\c
Your power is thrilling...\nI'm thrilled down to my toes!\n
I'm so glad that there are Pokémon!\cThere isn't much else that gives me\nthe thrill that Pokémon do!\n
I want to win!\nThat desire I pour into my guitar!\cI want to win!\nThat passion compels my Pokémon!\c
We couldn't win...\nNo encores for us...\n
The Trainer's desire to win!\cIf you don't lose that, there's\nno limit on what you can become!\n
Spark!\cThis is what our Gym Leader did\nto the Gym out of boredom!\c
Spark...\n
We were lacking energy...\cNo, we lacked more than that. We\ndidn't want the win enough.\n
Whether you're a Trainer or a\nGuitarist, it takes dedication to\rimprove your mad skills!\c
My skills seem to have let me down.\nI must have been out of tune!\n
The way you battle, I can feel the\nvery heart of rock and roll.\cTell me, are you maybe a fan of\nrocking out?\n
Look at the way I'm dressed.\nCan't you see that I'm hardcore?\c
I was being serious!\nDon't laugh at me! I mean it!\n
I dress this way so I can get a feel for\nhow electric Pokémon think.\cWould you like to try, too?\n
This is the toughest Gym in Sinnoh.\cThat's why I'm here--to learn the\nbest battle techniques around!\c
...You're tough.\n
You just showed me that there's\nstill lots I need to learn.\cThe world of Pokémon is deep!\n
Can you make it to the Gym Leader?\nYou sure now?\c
The gears spin round and round...\nI spin down and out...\n
Our Gym's trick walkways are sure\nto make your head spin!\n
My dragon Pokémon chose to become\npowerful here. They sure like it!\c
Your battle style...\nSo savage...\n
It's been several years since I left\nthe Dragon's Den.\cI've got to say, your Pokémon are\nin the top class for toughness.
My dragon Pokémon chose to remain\nhere to become powerful.\c
There's something about you...\nYou're not just anybody.\cI challenge you!\c
You're at a different level of\nexpertise for sure!\n
You've won countless times...\nThat has made you very powerful.\n
There's something about you...\nYou still remain extraordinary.\cI challenge you again!\c
I constantly analyze Pokémon and\nvarious battles on my laptop.\c
...Things don't always work out\naccording to my calculations...\n
I had a lot of fun battling with\nyou, though.\cI wonder if I can analyze the\nbattle data properly?\cI could use a rematch to get\nsome additional data.\n
I analyzed our last battle on my\nlaptop.\c
For some reason I was drawn here,\nand it is here that I met you...\cI want to know what all this means!\c
I see...\cSo that's what it means...\n
I feel... I feel some sort of a mystic\npresence emanating from here...\n
Why have you come back to this spot?\nI want to know what all this means!\c
There is nothing here... And yet\nthere is a power lurking...\cWere you drawn by it, as well?\c
The power that slumbers within you...\nIt is rather marvelous indeed...\n
A place where nothing else exists...\cA place such as that is better suited\nto awaken the power within.\n
Do you see now?\nYou've come back again.\cThere must be something that draws\nyou to this place...\c
I don't care who you are--no one\ninterferes with my treasure hunting!\c
My Pokémon!\nMy treasures!\n
I heard there's an intriguing stone\nmonument around, so I came running.\n
I'm still here...and still searching\nfor treasures.\cHowever, a battle with you\nis a treasure I can't pass up!\c
All right, my Pokémon squad!\nGet out there and kick up a storm!\c
The squad failed to hit its stride...\n
Hmm...\cGazing out over the sea doesn't do a\nthing for toughening up my Pokémon!\n
Ah, it's been a long time!\cI have been toughening my fists\nagainst the sea, just as before!\c
I've seen countless Trainers and\neven more Pokémon!\cSo, what kind of a Trainer are you?\c
I see...\nSimply outstanding.
I've seen countless Trainers and\neven more Pokémon.\cYou're a strong Trainer.\nMoreover, your heart is strong.\n
I am indeed a Veteran, but I don't\nuse that as an excuse to slack off.\cI take pride in challenging those\nwho have bested me before!\c
Ugh...\nI didn't use items effectively.\n
I like to study a lot...\nI thought I could win...\n
I'll let you join my fan club if you can\nbeat me!\c
Ouch! Are you one of those loyal\nfans? You sure are rowdy!\n
Well, that's me and my Pokémon!\nThank you for being such a fan!\cJust so you know, our latest single\nis “Jigglin' Pokémon Wub”!\n
I've spotted a charismatic Trainer!\nWe just might have a scoop here!\c
My camera's too heavy.\nI couldn't battle effectively...\n
The lively expressions on you and\nyour Pokémon's faces...\cIt sure makes for some great TV!\n
Your spirit's vibes, man... I can feel\nthat you've got rock in your soul!\c
You beat me, man, but...\nI feel totally amped to jam harder!\n
Rock is about your spirit!\nBattling is about spirit, too!\rThat's why battles rock! Rawk!\n
You're live on camera, but try\nto act natural, OK?\c
The camera is our witness!\nIt's recorded our defeat...\n
I'd like to take that footage and\nhave it broadcast worldwide.\n
Two Pokémon! If you had two Pokémon,\nwe'd have a great scene to shoot!\n
So, let's begin and find out what\nsort of a Trainer you are!\c
You have a superstar quality!\nYou sure could become a celebrity!\n
I lost, but I'm totally thrilled!\nWe just made some great TV!\n
Oh, no. What we're looking for is you\nto battle with two Pokémon!\n
Are we all ready to have some fun?\nI sure am! Aren't you having fun?!\rLet's make it fun! OK?! Mwahahah!\c
Oh, no, no, no!\nMwahahah?\n
A clown's makeup is a face that's\ncrying while laughing. Mwahahah!\cIt defines what we do!\n
Po-Po-Pokémon!\nDo you think I'm a real Pokémon?\c
Pi-Pikachu!\n
I need to find a way to get more into\nthe character of a Pokémon...\n
Join me in this on-the-spot report,\nlive at the scene of a battle!\c
The media is the victim!\n
Interviews are about taking the\ninitiative. The people need to know.\n
How is this madness possible?\nThe two of us, losing to children?\n
This won't do... Time to retreat.\nThis mission is a failure.\n
How insolent.\nTake a bite of this, child!\n
Losing to some child...\nBeing careless cost me too much.\n
We are acquiring Pokémon for a most\nastonishing undertaking!\cYour meddling won't be tolerated!\c
I feel like I got meddled with...\n
Our astonishing undertaking is\nmost certainly breathtaking.\cIf you ever hope to see its glorious\nunveiling, then don't meddle with us!\n
                           
             
                                                       
Our objectives are incredible!\nToo incredible for me to understand!\cI'll fight blindly to defend them,\nand your intrusion won't be forgiven!\c
What was I fighting for, again?
What do you have against taking\nPokémon from others?\cLook in any field or forest!\nThose things aren't exactly rare!\n
                       
                         
                                                
So sorry, sweetie.\nTeam Galactic has no room for kiddies!\c
B-but, deary, you're just a kid!\n
You wanted to go up?\nWell, why didn't you?\n
Let's see how good this Pokémon is!\nI stole it from some weak Trainer.\c
What is this?!\n
Wimpy little Pokémon...\cWhen I get promoted, I'll demand\nbetter stolen Pokémon.\n
Why, thank you!\cWe love it when people come to us\nto donate their Pokémon!\c
What do you think you're doing?!\n
You can catch Pokémon anywhere.\nWhat's so special about them?\cTrainers that lose theirs should\nquit whining and catch some more!\n
                                               
             
                                                                      
Ancient ruins rife with the UNOWN...\nThere has to be a meaning!\cBut its significance eludes me, and\nthat's gotten me cranky!\c
The search must continue!\n
The significance of the ancient ruins...\cOnly Pokémon that look like the letters\nof some strange language...\cCan they be trying to convey a message\nto us?\n
I can't explain it...\nBeing here compels me to battle!\c
Hunh?!\nWhat was I just doing?!\n
The desire to do battle lingers on...\cDo such spirits of Pokémon still roam\nwithin these walls?\n
I need to shake off my sorrow...\nPlease, battle with me!\c
My sorrow has deepened...\n
I won't ever forget the Pokémon that\nI've spent time with, however fleeting.\n
It makes no difference where we are.\cIf you have Pokémon with you,\nI reckon you ought to battle.\c
You've got a lot of giddyap and go\nin you!\n
Over a long life, you'll be certain\nto have some sad farewells.\cBut I reckon there are also some\nnew beginnings.\n
Hahaha! I'm afraid y'all are no match\nfor us with jus' one of them Pokémon!
My Pokémon is a lively one.\nLemme show you how much!\c
Well! Aren't you the lively one!
Them graves here in Lost Tower...\nRight'n here, inside my heart...\cThose are the places where my\nPokémon remain...\n
You haven't got yerself two\nPokémon?\n
My Pokémon were taken from me...\nTeam Galactic did it...\cEver since, I've never forgiven\ntheir faces...\c
Gwaaaaaah!\n
I'm not doing my Pokémon any favors\nby ruining its memory like this...\cI can't be wallowing around forever.\nI gotta move on and turn the page.
Mike: I can't embarrass myself again.\nNot in front of my girlfriend!\c
Mike: Awww, jeez.\nMan, that's a downer...\n
Mike: Coming here again brings back\nall kinds of memories of me and Nat.\n
Mike: You can't battle with us.\nNot with one Pokémon, anyway.\n
Nat: I don't want to look bad again.\nNot when my boyfriend is watching!\c
Nat: This makes me feel hollow\ninside... Oh, so hollow...\n
Nat: The Pokémon that brought me and\nMike together is buried here...\n
Nat: You do have at least two\nPokémon, don't you?\n
Waah! Ghost! Get away! Eek!\nHelp me, team!\c
Hey...\nYou're no ghost...\n
I had to come to the Lost Tower on\na dare...\cI have to go to the top and use Defog\nthere...\n
Beating you would be my 100th\nstraight win! Here's to a fun battle!\c
How could I lose now?!\nThis is beyond aggravating!\n
I wish I could beat Maylene in\nVeilstone City one day...\n
Yeah, I like to camp! So what?\nLet's battle!\c
I should've just stuck to\ncamping out here...\n
When I'm with my Pokémon, I can camp\njust about anywhere I want!\n
If we were to battle, your Pokémon \nwould become tougher.\cLikewise, my Pokémon would also\nbecome tougher.\cIt's all good.\nThis calls for a battle!\c
You know, I would have really enjoyed\na win there. Would've been real nice.\n
This mine's been abandoned, but\nnow it's home to many Pokémon.\cI guess everything finds a place\nto call home someday...
Tough Pokémon...\nTough Trainers...\cYou tell me, where else can I find\na place as good as this to train?\c
That was good.\nYou've bonded well with your Pokémon.\n
Tough Pokémon...\nTough Trainers...\cTheir strength comes from their bond.\nAnd that's something that can be\rmade stronger anywhere.\n
I'll pound the fear of my fists into\nyou all karate style, punk!\c
I'm so sorry...\nI got a bit mouthy there, didn't I?\n
So, I'm gonna try and shatter steel!\cI wonder how many more years it\nwould take for me to do that?\n
Every good Hiker gets a boost of\nenergy when surrounded by boulders!\cWrooooar! Coming at you!\nLet me blow off some steam!\c
Whew... Crazy, delicious sugar!\nI think I've calmed down now...\n
If it's called a mountain, you can\nbe sure I'll be climbing it.\cEven if it's a mountain of food, I'll\nstill be stickin' my flag on top!\n
When you're up in the mountains,\na battle'd do for a proper greeting!\c
Yahoo!\n
Actually, when you're up in the\nmountains, a simple hi'd do if\ryou walk past someone.\cOh, and this isn't the mountains.\n
May we have a battle, please?\cIt will be something to lighten up this\nboring picnic with.\c
We're not going to win if we play\naround like that...\n
I'm going home to play with my\nPokémon!\n
The working-class hero says hi!\c
The working-class hero waves bye...\n
I used to work here a long time\nago, before it shut down.\cI worked at the ironworks near\nFloaroma Town, too.\cYou might say I'm drawn by iron\nas if by magnet!\n
While I'm making sure the lifts are\nsafe, I'll focus on a battle with you!\c
A-OK! Looks safe to me!\nNot a problem in sight!\n
I routinely check the lifts here.\nYou can be sure of their safety!\n
Hey! This is no playground!\nIf you're gonna play, battle me!\c
You played me like an amateur!\n
They were going to close this place\nup so no one could get in.\cBut, they left it open so people and\nPokémon can get together here.
The Canalave Gym folks use this place\nas their training grounds.\c
Maybe I should head to the Gym and\nwork out there...\n
Roark spent his childhood playing\nhere, I think...\n
Humph! You're lost, aren't you?\nI'll guide you if you can beat me.\c
You didn't really have to win!\nI'm not going to guide you now!\n
I'm not lost, I tell you!\nI'm camping! That's my story!\n
Huh? Are you lost too?\nNo? It doesn't matter.\rLet's have a quick Pokémon battle!\c
Lost?\nThere's nothing lost about this kid!\n
I got separated from my friends...\cI've got my Pokémon with me, so I'm\nOK, but...\n
You look like you might just have\nthe Pokémon I've been looking for!\c
You didn't have a single Pokémon\nI wanted... You're no Collector!\n
I'm very picky, so I want to collect\nevery Pokémon without anyone's help.\c...I do have friends, though.\nNo, seriously! I do!\n
In deep tunnels and caves, there're\na couple things you're sure to see.\cZUBAT and Ruin Maniacs!\c
Your awesome power...\nIt's mystifying.\n
I've scoured every inch of this\nplace... Most of it while I was lost.\cAnyway, if there's one thing I can\nsay, this place can't be called ruins!\n
Hush now, lost little Pokémon, don't\nyou cry.\cI'm here to take care of you!\c
Sniffle... W-who's crying now?\n
Speaking of crying, I'm positive I\nheard crying from deeper in the cave.\n
Look! A Trainer lost in Wayward Cave!\c
I strayed from the battle plan!\n
Me? No, I'm not lost.\nI live here!\n
Wandering around, I got hungry, so\nI ate some wild mushrooms...\cThey gave me gas, and now I can't\nstop burping! Bluurrf!\c
Bleff! Hurk!\nI think...I'm getting better...\n
I hear there's a Pokémon that has\nmushrooms growing on its back.\cNot around here, somewhere far away.\nI wonder if they taste any good?
Where am I? Am I lost? Who are you?\nAre you a Pokémon Trainer?\c
OK, so we're both Trainers.\nThat's a start, right?\n
I just wanted to have a picnic under\nthe Cycling Road.\cI didn't think I would get lost\nin a place like this...
What every good picnic needs is a\ncute setting, good food, and a fun\rbattle!\c
That wasn't any fun for me!\n
Why have a picnic here? I don't know.\nThere's no deep meaning to it.
Did you come to play, too?\nWanna play battle with me?\c
You were just toying with me!
I'm playing hide-and-seek here.\nI like some underground tag, too.\n
The sharp vision of my bird Pokémon\nwill see through your weaknesses!\c
Don't you have an Achilles' heel?
I want to become stronger, but only\nwith my favorite Pokémon.\n
Learning how to manage tough Pokémon\nis the shortcut to getting tough.\c
I lost? But how is that possible?!\n
Getting the best out of any Pokémon...\nThat's what makes a good Trainer...\n
When Trainers lock eyes...\cThat's right! It's time to let\ntheir Pokémon go wild!\c
Your Pokémon have a real peppy feel to\nthem!\n
Whether you're talking to people or\nPokémon, it's important to always look\rthem square in the eyes.\n
I want my Pokémon to get a taste of\nthe sweetness that is victory.\cI can't afford to lose this one!\c
This defeat has the tang of my bitter\ntears...
I'm sorry, my Pokémon team...\cI promise, I'll get better at this so\nyou can get a taste of victory!\n
I will win. I am sure of it.\nTherefore, you will lose!\c
But...\nThis isn't possible!\n
It's not that you've won.\nIt's just that I lost!\c...It's all the same.\nGo, me.\n
Let me see what you got there, kid.\nI could give you some advice.\c
You got way too much!\n
Well, I don't have any advice for\nsomeone as tough as you!\n
Now we shall battle, and from it will\nemerge one loser...\c
...!\n
I can use psychic powers, but\nbattling isn't so simple...\cIt takes much more to win!\n
A battle is a clash of willpower!\cThe one who wants the win the most\nwill emerge the victor!\c
But... I thought I could win!\n
Psychic power...\cI know it isn't easy to believe in\nsomething that you can't see.\cBut love, friendship...\nYou can't see those, either.\n
Allow me to demonstrate how a true\nPsychic conducts a battle!\c
Did I get to show you anything...?\nAnything at all?\n
What can psychic power be used for?\cWell, one mustn't use it for committing\ncrimes.\cBut, I don't use it for doing good,\neither.\cUsing psychic power leaves me too worn\nout!\n
I see it!\nI see a victory for me!\c
The future...is different!\nWhy?!\n
Your efforts have altered the very\npath of the future!\n
I trained all of my gnarly Pokémon\nat the Fighting Dojo in Kanto!\c
D  n     i\n  o  e     n...\n
We're gonna go ahead and leave...\nYou know, go train elsewhere.\n
Judo chop!\nPokémon battle!\c
Wrroar!\nJudo chop defeated!
I'll forget that we lost!\c...Wait, if I did that, we'd never\nlearn from our mistakes...\n
What it means to battle...\nIts joys, its sorrows...\rI've experienced it all!\c
My sorrow deepens...\n
You may be a child, but you've taught\nme a whole lot. I thank you humbly.\n
I'll wheel out some wicked Pokémon\nand even wickeder moves!\c
All I can manage now is to wheeze\nout a few meek sighs...\n
I don't see what my age has to do\nwith playing with Pokémon, frankly.\n
I let my bird Pokémon carry me to\nwherever. And so, here I am!\c
Sheesh... I arrive in a new place, and\nit turns out to be the Battle Zone...\n
I was born in the Hoenn region.\nI've only just recently flown here.\n
I let my bird Pokémon do as they\nwish. And so, we train here daily!\c
My Pokémon grew up in the arms of\nMother Nature. They're tough!\c
How could you be tougher than\nMother Nature?\n
Most of the time, my Pokémon return\nto their Poké Balls right away.\cBut sometimes, they just fall asleep\non top of my head. That gets messy.
The desire to win... That should be\nevident in every Trainer!\c
See the potential of dragon Pokémon!\nThe Championship is within my sights!\c
Potential doesn't mean I can win...\n
A Dragon Tamer Champion...\cI'll need to train so much more to\neven come close to coming close...\n
I've cranked up my dragon Pokémon's\npotential!\cI've been looking forward to seeing\nyou again!\c
My Pokémon and I seek only victory!\c
Arrrgh! My Pokémon...\n
I failed my Pokémon!\nI wasn't prepared enough to lead it!\cI don't ever want my precious Pokémon\nto be humiliated again!\n
You've beaten us once before, but we\nwon't make the same mistake!\c
Dragon Pokémon are sacred beings...\nThat's what my master taught me.\cAnd now I'll prove it to you!\c
Not good enough!\nWe're still not strong enough!\n
It's not good enough for a Pokémon\nto just be tough.\cIt's not good enough for a Trainer\nto just work hard.\cBoth have to grow together!
This time we'll get it right!\cMarvel at the exquisite combination of\nmy Pokémon and myself!\c
How do you do?\nI'm Stanley, and I'm a Dragon Tamer.\cWhat do you say we let our Pokémon\nhave it out? Sound OK to you?\c
Victory!\nThat is, victory for you...\n
It seems to me, there's this certain\nimage that goes with a Dragon Tamer.\cBut me, I'd much sooner take it easy,\ntake it slow, and take it my own way.\cI figure there's more than my style\nthat I need to work on first.\n
Hey, how do you do again?\cWhat do you say we let our Pokémon\nhave at it again? Sound OK to you?\c
There is something missing in the\nway I battle...\cI've come here to find it.\c
I see it now...\nI know what I lack.\n
Battling you was an eye-opener.\cI learned something very important\nin that short time.\n
Have you discovered what's missing in\nyour battles? I have.\c
I've got the urge to battle with you.\nHope you're willing to oblige!\c
I shouldn't have paid attention\nto my urge...\n
So long as my partner's alongside me,\nI'm willing to take on the world!\n
The urge to battle you again has\nstruck me. Want to humor me?\c
Have you any knowledge of levels\nor the stats of Pokémon? Well, I do!\c
Hmm. I like how you attack.\n
Pokémon and numbers...\nWho cares about that stuff?\cWinning is what's important.\nNumbers aren't everything.\n
Pokémon battles aren't decided by\nnumbers.\cIt's the bond you share with your\nPokémon that decides outcomes!\c
Welcome to my Pokémon show!\c
Did you enjoy the show?\nSuper fabulous, wasn't it?\n
I'll be happy to battle you again!\nLet's battle again sometime, yeah?
Welcome to my new Pokémon show!\c
I've pumped up my gang till they can't\nget pumped no more.\cThey're going to school your Pokémon!\c
My bunch got schooled, and how!\n
I fed my gang Protein, Carbos...\nYou name it, I pumped 'em full of it.\n
Hey! You're that Trainer who schooled\nme and my Pokémon!\cOK, this time we'll return the favor!\nWe'll be doing the schooling!\c
I took great pains raising my partners.\nI'll show you how strong I made them!\c
It needs to be leveled more?!\n
My Pokémon...\cThey're the first friends I ever\ncaught. They mean everything to me!
...When I close my eyes, I can picture\nhow we lost to you in vivid detail.\cBut, I've raised them since then! I'll\nthrow their strength in your face!\c
Worthy opponents... The search for\nthem drives me to travel far.\c
I've certainly found a tough\nadversary in you...\n
How much you believe in your\nPokémon...\cThat's a critical factor in how a\nbattle will turn out.\n
We've faced many challengers since\nwe met, but they were all weak...\cI relish the tough resistance that\nonly you can provide!\c
Please don't hold anything back.\c
Hmm...\n
I feel invigorated from that battle,\neven though we lost.\cAfter all, we gave it everything we\nhad.
Hello again! Please don't hold\nanything back--just like before.\c
You're willing to battle?\nLet me see what you have?\c
Your love of Pokémon really shows!\n
I grew up together with Felix and\nmy team, right from my childhood.\cAll our memories, we've always shared\nthem.\n
Oh, hi, we meet again.\cMay I see what you've done with your\nPokémon?\c
The world is huge, and there are\nso many different Pokémon!\cWhat kinds of Pokémon are with you?\nPlease, I want to have a look!\c
Wow, there are Pokémon that\nwonderful!\n
There is always something to like\nabout any Pokémon.\cIt's so hard to decide which ones\nI should raise.\n
If I'm having trouble deciding,\nI go with my favorites!\c
What sort of moves have you taught?\nThat tells me how good you are!\c
Yowch!\n
I heard that somewhere there's\nsomeone who teaches Pokémon moves.\n
Have you taught your team any new\nmoves since last time?\c
When eyes meet...\nThat's when a battle starts!\c
You won't let me win?\n
I suddenly remembered what it was \nlike when I had my first battle.\cI wonder why that would be?\n
When eyes meet...\nThat's when a battle starts!\rThat's what makes us Trainers!\c
You're going to win!\nThat's the future I saw!\c
What I saw in the future turned out\nto be true...\n
I lost, but my vision of the future\ncame true...\n
You're going to win again!\nThat's the future I saw!\c
Right after this, you will send out your\nPokémon to do battle!\c
After this, I will reluctantly hand over\nthe prize money to you...\n
What will you do after this?\cWhy don't you decide for yourself?\nIt would be much more fun that way!\n
Right after this, you will hurl a Poké\nBall in an astonishingly cool way!\c
My quest for power brought me here.\cIt was beneath the desert sand that\nI toughened my body and soul.\cAccept my challenge! Uraah!\c
My spirit is broken...\n
I thought I couldn't win before it\nbecame a fact...\cI've let down my Pokémon...\cThey go to battle with faith in\ntheir Trainer...
This time! This time I will win!\nMy spirit is renewed and strong!\c
I have meditated under a waterfall\nto temper my spirit.\cAllow me to demonstrate its strength!\c
Ha-choo! Sniffle...\n
All that time under the waterfall...\nSeems I've caught a cold.\n
Since the day I lost to you, I've\nmeditated under a waterfall!\c
People! Nature! Pokémon!\nHarmony is essential!\c
You're A-OK!\n
Protecting Pokémon and nature.\nThink of what that means.\n
Do you remember my slogan?\nPeople! Nature! Pokémon!\cThat's right, harmony is essential!\c
I work to protect beautiful, natural\nenvironments.\cMy Pokémon are my constant\ncompanions while I work.\c
Oh, my gosh!\nMy poor Pokémon!\n
Everyone can do their part to keep\nnature clean. It doesn't take much.\n
I'm on patrol in pristine nature\nwith my Pokémon like usual.\cCome to think of it, you're always\nwith Pokémon, too.\c
We go on patrol to make sure there's\nnothing strange going on.\cAnd occasionally, we battle!\c
Thanks much!\n
Using the Pokémon ability Pickup for\ngathering dropped items is a good thing.\cI think it's ecological, even.\nI am cleaning up the environment!\n
Patrols day in and day out!\nAnd the occasional battle!\c
In the embrace of Mother Nature,\npeople and Pokémon grow strong!\c
Your Pokémon are so muscular.\nIt makes me sigh seeing them...\n
It doesn't matter where they grow.\cPokémon can be made tougher\nanywhere if you set your mind to it.\n
By battling tough opponents, both\nTrainers and Pokémon grow tough!\c
We've grown strong together in\nnature and in the concrete jungle.\cWe make everywhere we go our\nplayground!\c
You're really tough, aren't you?!\n
Look around you at this wildly\ncontorted terrain.\cIt's no wonder that Pokémon would\ngrow tough in a place like this.\n
We're tough, but we know you're just\nas tough!\cLet's battle it out to see which one of\nus is tougher!\c
Are you getting worn out from all\nthe running you've done?\c
You're not tired at all?!\n
The world is full of Pokémon and all\nsorts of Trainers.\n
What do you think of the Battle\nZone?\cYou've met so many Pokémon...\nI've got to battle you again!\c
A Trainer riding a Pokémon!\nI like that! Let's battle it out!\c
Awesome!\nYou're a real wild child!\n
You ride atop the waves while riding on\na Pokémon!\cAnd you rode right over me!\n
Yo, Pokémon-riding Trainer!\nHow about a rematch?\c
Check out my physique! The rough\nseas sculpted this awesome body!\c
I've got a muscular physique, but\nthere's no strength behind it...\n
Seeing a Pokémon use Surf to carry you\nout on the sea...\cIt strikes an emotional chord with me\nsomewhere deep down.\n
The rough seas almost drowned...\n...I mean, sculpted this awesome body!\cLet my chiseled physique inspire you!\c
Check out my dynamic form!\nVictory is assured!\c
Oh.\nThat's how it is.\n
Being a good swimmer doesn't make\nme any better as a Trainer...\n
Hi! You're that kid who's great with\nPokémon!\cI'll battle with an even more dynamic\nform than before! Watch me now!\c
Me and my Pokémon are pumped up\nand ready to go all out!\c
Our muscles are deflating...\n
Overwhelm with our dazzling physiques!\nThat was our game plan...\n
Me and my Pokémon are pumped up!\nSee, our muscles are twitching!\c
People keep coming to us for battles.\nI really don't know why! Teehee!\c
OK, we lost.\n
I wanted to be alone, but swatting\naway immature boys on the prowl...\cWell, my Pokémon grew tough without\nme really even trying.\n
People still keep coming to us for\nbattles! Why?! Leave me alone!\c
Are your Pokémon growing properly?\c
Maybe too grown up!\n
I've grown with my Pokémon, too.\nMy swimsuit's getting a little tight...\n
Did your Pokémon grow any more?\cMy Pokémon?\nMine are doing awesome!\c
I'm a mermaid drifting among the\nwaves...\cAnd a high-spirited gal who battles with\nPokémon!\c
Losing...\nMakes my tears well up.\n
A mermaid's tears are so salty...\n
I'm still a mermaid drifting among the\nwaves...\cAnd a high-spirited gal who battles with\nPokémon!\c
I want to be with my water Pokémon!\nThat's why I swim!\c
Glub glub...\nI'm sinking...\n
I thought that everyone would be all\ndedicated to training out here.\cBut most people are really laid back.\nIt's not like what I imagined.\cI guess being with Pokémon, people get\nall mellowed out.\n
I want to be with water Pokémon!\nThat's why I'm going to get tougher!\c
                                                                 
                    
                                                         
With one mighty flap, my birds blow\naway the embers of aggression!\c
We failed to get off the ground...\n
The HM Fly isn't useful inside caves.\nIt's such a shame.\n
Dragons and a fiery mountain...\nIt's a totally classic setup!\c
Losing isn't a happy occasion...\n
My Pokémon seem to like it here\na lot.\n
Are you seeking the mythical\nPokémon, too? Let's battle, then!\c
There's nothing left...\n
The mythical Pokémon that sleeps\ndeep in a volcano...\cCould it be a dragon Pokémon?\n
What it means to win battles...\nThat is what I seek.\rTeach me if you will!\c
I grow less certain still...\n
Perhaps there is no meaning to\nvictory, but still I will battle!\cThat is what makes me a Trainer!\n
Let me ask to see if you know.\nWhat is time?\c
Another memory...\nIn a chain of memories.\n
For me, time is the fabric woven by\nmemories, one after another...\n
I was born in Floaroma Town.\nI'm sure thrilled to be here.\cIt took a long time to get here.\nWe're not going to lose again!\c
We went down...\nWe couldn't stick it out...\n
You can level all you want, but that\nwon't guarantee you any wins.\cBut we keep trying to get better.\nThat's what makes us Trainers.\n
The Trainers and Pokémon that gather\nhere aren't pushovers.\rThey all have tricks up their sleeves!\c
You're not a Trainer that can be\ntaken lightly!\n
The Pokémon you'll meet here won't\nmake it easy for you to move onward.\n
You've come all this way for Pokémon?\nYou must be dedicated.\c
Your dedication won out.\n
The Pokémon here must battle each\nother all the time.\cThat must be why they are so strong\nin this area.\n
Can you answer this for me?\nWhat is space?\c
And another...\nA new memory was born.\n
For me, space is where memories are\nmade...\n
I came here after winning my way\nthrough the Battle Tower!\c
But...\nI had a win streak going...\n
Train more at the Battle Tower...\nThat's what I'll do.\n
We're all good to go!\nWe just have to battle now!\c
Aww...\nI'm out of useful items!\n
We came completely unprepared for\nthis little adventure...\n
I had a revelation this morning.\cI knew that I would have a wonderful\nencounter here today.\c
There's nothing wonderful about this!\n
Is my sense of premonition nothing\nto write home about?\n
I'll use my mystifying psychic power\nto pulverize you!\c
That's what I get for making idle\nclaims...\n
Psychic power is a mystery that\ndefies explanation.\cBut if everything could be explained,\nit would be a boring world.
My Pokémon can destroy anything.\nAnd you think you can win?!\c
We weren't up to the task!\n
Even though my team could break\nbricks and shatter boulders, they\rfailed to dent your spirits!\n
Hear the howl of my iron fists!\nHowdy! I'm crazy for karate!\c
Losing made it clear to me.\nYou're crazy about Pokémon!\n
I love seeing people who love Pokémon\nmore than anything!\n
What do you expect to achieve here?\nI'll be the one to make that call!\c
You've earned the right to be here.\nBoth you and your Pokémon.\n
You may find it odd, but the stink\nof sulfur from the volcanic gas\ris what draws me here.\n
                                                                                     
     
                                                            
                                                                                     
     
                                                            
                                                                                      
     
                                                            
                                                                                      
     
                                                            
                                                  
                             
                                                          
                                                  
                             
                                   
                                                  
                             
                                                              
                                                  
                             
                                                     
                           
         
                                
                           
         
                                
                           
         
                                
                           
         
                                
                                                                                   
                              
                                                            
                                                                          
                              
                                                            
                                                                            
                              
                                                            
                                                                                     
                              
                                                            
                                                                                     
                              
                                                            
                                                                                   
                              
                                                            
                                                                                
                              
                                                            
I just got worked over!\nAnd by a kid no less...\n
...!\nAgain and again...\n
It is our mission to stall you.\nSorry, but we gotta do our job.\c
Losing was a part of my job, too.\n...I feel better by saying that.\n
From three lakes, we must secure three\nPokémon.\cYou simply mustn't interfere!\n
In order for us to bring peace to\nthe world, we must control it!\c
You're too young to understand.\n
Our boss always had plans for\nthe three lakes...\cWhile you were blissfully ignorant,\nour work went ahead...\n
I'll knock your Pokémon into orbit!\c
My mind is going orbital!\n
The Pokémon here has already been\ntaken to our HQ in Veilstone.\cSo, you see?\nA child like you can't touch us!\n
If this mission is successful, we\nwill get a nice bonus.\c
There goes our bonus...\nThis is an epic tragedy...\n
I want Team Galactic to become\npowerful. That is all I want.\n
...You, my friend, are tough!\nI can see why you defy us so...\n
We set off the Galactic Bomb!\nIts blast force was phenomenal!\c
Your Pokémon attack with phenomenal\npower...\n
But so what?\nYou aim to take us all on?\cDream on!\nTeam Galactic is huge in number.\cEven as we speak, other members should\nbe near Twinleaf Town.\cThat's right, they're on the way to\nLake Verity!\n
I'll punish you in place of our\nboss for defying Team Galactic!\c
Grr...\nI took the punishment...\n
We're Team Galactic!\nThe no. 1 syndicate in the world!\cTo defy us is to defy the universe!\n
...Would you like to join the MAGIKARP\nand flop around in the mud?\c
...Overwhelming!\n
I played you for a child, and paid\na stiff price for my arrogance...\cHowever, you're much too late.\cTeam Galactic has already found the\nsunken island under the lake.\cAnd the Pokémon that lay in it?\nWell, what do you think?\n
You're tough, kid!\nBut, I still pity the likes of you.\n
Well, what have we here?\nA Trainer who's lost their way?\c
You're lost but you won!\nThat burns me up to eleven!\n
You barged right into our HQ?\nYou must not know what fear is, kid!\n
What with that creepy Charon and a kid\nlike you around, the HQ's not the\rsame anymore.\cLike, you characters changed the,\nwell, character of the place!\c
Oh, sure. Why don't you just get\nall cocky about it!\n
Without our special card key, you're\nnot going to get very far.\cWell, non-Team Galactic member?\nWhat's your next move?\n
Who do you think you are?\nDesecrating the halls of our HQ?!\c
A tough little Trainer is what you\nare...\n
In our HQ, we get around by taking\nwarp panels.\cI'd like to see you figure out how\nthey connect.\n
You're too young to understand the\nchanging times!\cStand aside and let Team Galactic\nshape the future!\c
I failed to read the flow of battle, and\nyour power was unfathomable...\n
Come on, I said something cool before\nthe battle.\cYou need to read the dramatic situation\nbetter here!\n
I'm, like, this close to getting my\npromotion to Commander.\cI'll impress our great boss by making\nyou my newest trophy!\c
...I wish this never happened.
Losing sets me back to square one...\cI'll probably get busted down to the\ngruntiest of the grunts... Humph!
                           
                
                                
                            
                        
                                                        
Intruder alert!\nThere's something smelly about you!\c
Oh, it was my own Pokémon's smell...\n
How could we arouse suspicion?\nWe're Team Galactic, and this is our HQ!\n
Having fun scampering around our HQ,\nyou sneaky intruder?\cYour trail blazing will go out in\na blaze of glory right now!\c
Your trailblazing streak lives on!\n
So what, you have momentum...\nIt's too late. The experiment's done!\n
You should be tired out by now.\nIt's Team Galactic's turn to shine!\c
What? I don't get it.\nWhat's your rush?\n
Pokémon are that important to you?\nIs that what this is all about?\n
Are you enjoying your unescorted,\nunauthorized, and unsettling tour\rof Team Galactic HQ?\c
Let me do what I want!\n
It doesn't matter what happens to\nthe Team Galactic HQ building.\cSoon, all will belong to Team\nGalactic, anyway!\n
Hey there, little Trainer!\nYou're famous among Team Galactic.\cThe order has been issued--we get\na promotion if we put you down!\c
I just blew my promotion...\n
What's so special about you anyway?\cYou're just like any other little kid\nTrainer you can find anywhere!
Our time has come!\nIt's Team Galactic's time now!\c
When's it gonna be my turn...\n
It's too late!\cNo amount of desperation from a kid\nlike you will make a difference!\n
Our time is coming!\nA time for us alone!\cWe'll send you back in time.\nA time before you started training!\c
Gyah!\n
You can struggle all you want, but\nyou can't stop Team Galactic alone!\cIt doesn't matter how many Pokémon\nyou try to use as your tools!\n
Team Galactic is all powerful!\cOnly a fool would show defiance to\nthe mighty might of Team Galactic!\c
Not standing up to the mighty is\nfoolish, you say...\n
It doesn't matter if you're an adult\nor a kid if you have Pokémon...\cPokémon are the equalizers.\nI should have realized sooner...
I can't believe you chased me here...\nOK, let's see how tough you are.\c
Where do you get that power?!\n
Mt. Coronet...\cI might be just a grunt, but even I\ncan tell it has a weird energy!\n
This is our final operation.\nNo one will interfere!\c
You turned the tables on me...\nI call interference...\n
The closer you are to the peak,\nthe closer you are to space!\cSoon, Team Galactic will... Uh...\nTeam Galactic will achieve greatness!\n
Team Galactic will take control of\neverything!\cYou can try all you want, but you\ncan't do anything alone!\c
All you gave me was the taste of\ndefeat...\n
...Is our boss about to ditch us\nand claim everything for himself?
We Grunts have two jobs.\cOne, ensure the success of our\noperation at the summit.\cTwo, utterly destroy any intruders\nto stop their meddling!\c
I don't accept this!\nI will not accept this!\n
Join Team Galactic and then abide\nby our rules.\cThat would solve all our problems!\n
Say, listen, do you realize you're\nbreaking hearts by being successful?\cIt's your fault that Team Galactic\nmembers are in so much pain...\c
See? You've left me brokenhearted,\ntoo...\n

Bika bikabika!\nPigachu!\c
Pikachu...\n
Pika...\cI'll need a lot more practice to\nbecome a real PIKACHU...\n
I work in the fiery foundry.\nYou bet I'm hot and sweaty!\c
I burned out...\n
I toughened up my muscles from\nhonest work.\cPokémon have nothing on me!\n
Well! It's not often we get a visitor\nlike you to the ironworks!\cLet's mark the occasion with\na battle!\c
Fire! And once more, only because I\nfeel like it, fiyaaaah!\n
The floor panels move automatically.\nWe're pretty proud of them here!\n
Are you maybe getting annoyed by\nwhere the floor panels take you?\c
I'm going down in flames!\n
The sweat of a working man is\nbeautiful to behold...\cThere is also beauty in the tears\nwept from defeat...\n
The toughest of all the grunts!\nThat was me...\n
Arrgh!\nI let some little kid beat me!\n
Sheesh... I should have done the\nfighting myself.\n
Humph! You've toughened up.\nBut you're no match for our boss.\n
Done in by two kids?!\nThis isn't right!\n
I should have kept my head down and\njust watched our warehouse...\n
Fweh... If I didn't run...\nI could've...battled harder...\n
My last Pokémon.\n
I see... I may lose if this pace\ncontinues...\n
Interesting.\nAnd quite curious.\n
I admit that you have pushed me\nto this extreme.\n
This... This cannot be!\nIt's not possible that I lose!\n
I won't accept this!\nThis can't be!\cNot after all the sacrifices we've made\nto get this far!\cWhat of my new world?!\nOf my new galaxy?!\cWas this all a dream to be swept away\nby your reality?!\n
I want to cry...\nMy heart is shattered...\n
They're too tough to handle!\nWhat a combination!\n
Oh, yeah? When the going gets tough,\nmy Pokémon get tougher!\n
What just went down?!\nYou're telling me I lost again?!\n
Oh, yeah? When the going gets tough,\nmy Pokémon get tougher!\n
What just went down?!\nYou're telling me I lost again?!\n
Oh, yeah? When the going gets tough,\nmy Pokémon get tougher!\n
What just went down?!\nYou're telling me I lost again?!\n
I'm not giving up till the end!\nI can't give up!\n
What just went down?!\nYou wait! I'll get tougher!\n
I'm not giving up till the end!\nI can't give up!\n
What just went down?!\nYou wait! I'll get tougher!\n
I'm not giving up till the end!\nI can't give up!\n
What just went down?!\nYou wait! I'll get tougher!\n
If I battle now, won't it mess up my\nusual pace?\c
My pace is completely off...\n
If I battle now, won't it mess up my\nusual pace?\c
My pace is completely off...\n
What in the...?!\nThat one hurt, you!\n
No way! We can keep going!\nThis is where we hit our stride!\n
What are you saying?!\nWe ended up losing?!\n

You've forced my hand this time!\n
Impressive.\nYour prowess is notable.\n
Ouch! Are you one of those loyal\nfans? You sure are rowdy!\n

My camera's too heavy.\nI couldn't battle effectively...\n

You beat me, but...\nI feel totally amped to jam harder!\n

You're so strong!
You're so strong!!\n
You're so strong!!!\n
You're so strong!!!!\n
You're so strong!!!!!\n
Too much for me!\n
Oh, dear me!\n
Your toughness is something else.\nWe were completely overwhelmed!\n
...\n
No way! Not yet!\nNot giving up!\n
W-what? That can't be!\nMy buffed-up Pokémon!\n
Are you saying something?\nYou think you have me cornered?\n
Amazing!\nYou're very good, aren't you?\n
If we turn it around here, the\nspectators will be stoked!\n
That puts a grin on my face!\nGuhahaha! That was a blast!\n
This is like back at the Gym, isn't it?\nI'm in a bit of a bind, aren't I?\n
I'm forced to admit defeat again...\nYou are much too strong.\n
It is too difficult, but...\nNever give up, never surrender!\n
You are so fantastically strong.\nI know why I have lost.\n
Not yet!\nYou can't break our will!\n
You're mighty!\nYou're worthy of lots of respect.\n
We're not done yet!\nThere's no giving up!\n
Hmm!\nMy sturdy Pokémon--defeated!\n
You methodically corner me!\nJust like before!\n
I even felt thrilled during our\nmatch.\cThat was a very good battle.\n
I can't keep up with healing...\n
Striking the right balance of offense\nand defense... It's not easy to do.\n
Your team!\nI sense your strong aura!\n
At times we battle, and sometimes we\nteam up...\cIt's great how Trainers can interact.\n
...My time with you is drawing to a\nclose...\n
...Awww.\n
Now this!\nThis is a smoking-hot situation!\n
Heeheehee!\nSo hot, you!\n
Oh, no!\nYou're too much for me!\n
Mira wonders if she can get very far in\nthe Battle Tower.\n
What's with you?!\nDo you have a vendetta against me?!\n
Humph! Quit flaunting your toughness!\nIt's not cute in the least!\n
Oh, dear... The trouble with fun is that\nit is over so quickly.\n
Wow!\nYou're out of this world!\n
You are good, you!\nMy Pokémon, they have enjoyed it, too!\n
My Pokémon can't be faulted with\nanything.\cYour brilliance carried the day.\n
It's not over yet!\nA League Elite Four can't give up!\n
I will now concede defeat.\cBut I think you came to see how\ngreat Bug-type Pokémon can be.\cI hope you also realized what you're\nup against in the Pokémon League.\cBattling is a deep and complex\naffair...\n
Dear child, don't assume for an\ninstant that you've won.\n
Well! Dear child, I must say, that\nwas most impressive.\cYour Pokémon believed in you and did\ntheir best to earn you the win.\cEven though I've lost, I find myself\nwith this silly grin!\n
I can feel your determination.\nYour will is overpowering me!\n
This situation...\nThis is heating up! I'm blazing now!\n
...!\cI don't believe it! I lost!\nI didn't take you for granted...\cBut I never expected you to win!\nI'd never even considered it!\cI'm blown away by this!\nYou and your Pokémon are hot stuff!\n
Hmm...\nNow what should I do...\n
I see...\cYour getting past the three before\nme was no fluke. Your power is real.\n
I can't remember the last time I\nwas put in a corner like this!\n
I won't let this end yet! This match\nis too fun to let it end this easily!\n
...Just a few minutes ago, you were\nthe most powerful challenger.\cAnd just now, you became the most\npowerful of all the Trainers.\cYou are now our newest Champion!\n
No way! I won't give up!\nThere's never any giving up!
What was that about?!\cI'm going to get tougher, though!\nTougher with these guys!\n
No way! I won't give up!\nThere's never any giving up!
What was that about?!\cI'm going to get tougher, though!\nTougher with these guys!\n

Oh!\nHere comes someone now!\cInstead of me, why not strike up\na chat with our newcomer?\c
It's rather boring if no one comes\nto visit...\cWhat might we do for entertainment...?\c
Do you sometimes get mistaken for\na real [VAR 010E(0000,0000)]?\cI just seem to get that feeling\nfrom you.\c
Hello!\cThat's right!\nIt's important to say a greeting!\cIf someone arrives, let's try to\nbe friendly!\c
Greetings!\c[VAR 011C(0000,0000)]?\nIt's wonderful!\rI really like it, too!\cWhen you meet someone for the first\ntime, the proper etiquette is to\rintroduce yourself.\cBy introducing yourself, you'll get to\nknow about the other person, too!\c
[VAR 011C(0000,0000)] Trainer?\nThat's what you are?\rIsn't that something!\cBut I'm sorry to say, I don't have\nany Pokémon...\cI would rather watch than battle,\nyou see.\c
Oh! Your [VAR 011C(0000,0000)]!\nI would love to have it!\rPlease trade me!\c...\cI was actually joking.\cI don't have any Pokémon, so\nI can't trade with anyone...\c
[VAR 011C(0000,0000)]?\nI can understand you'd want one...\cBut you shouldn't expect people to\nmake trades just for you.\cYou also have to consider what\nPokémon the other person wants.\c
Welcome to the Union Room!\cI'm the only one here now, but\nplease do bring your friends for\rsome fun and excitement!\cIf you have time on your hands,\nI'm also here to chat.\cYou see, I have a lot of time on\nmy hands...\c
I'm quite good at drawing!\cIf it's [VAR 011C(0000,0000)],\nleave it to me!\rNo one's better than me at it!\c
Oh, you're leaving...\c...\cIt makes me feel lonesome...\cPlease do come visit again!\c
What's wrong?\nAre you feeling down about something?\cIf you're feeling blue, it's much\nbetter to have fun with friends\rthan to be alone.\c

That's right!\cSometimes, it might be better to\njust go and invite other people.\cBut don't get too selfish or pushy\nbecause you want to [VAR 011C(0000,0000)].\c
Yes!\nIt's OK!\cNothing is impossible.\cThink positively and keep your\nchin up!\c

Good luck! I hope you enjoy\nserious battles.\cYou can't experience ones like\nthis in the Union Room!\c
You want to chat?\cWell, you shouldn't be wasting your\ntime chatting with me.\cYou need to be more active and talk\nto other players.\cAfter all, you can't make friends\nif you don't talk to people.\c
Where are you?\nUm... Right before my eyes.\cOh!\nAre you maybe an impostor?\cThe real player is somewhere else?\c...That's ridiculous!\nPlease, don't be silly!\rMy word!\c
[VAR 011C(0000,0000)] trade?\nThat sounds fun!\rI would love to as well.\cBut telling me that won't help.\nI can't trade with anyone.\c
If you want to have a [VAR 011C(0000,0000)]\nBattle, you need to be more\rassertive and talk to other players.\cIf you can't assert yourself, you\nmay never get a chance at a\r[VAR 011C(0000,0000)] Battle!\c
