Two Binacle live together on one rock.\nWhen they fight, one of them will move\nto a different rock.
When they evolve, two Binacle multiply into seven.\nThey fight with the power of seven Binacle.
Camouflaged as rotten kelp, they spray\nliquid poison on prey that approaches\nunawares and then finish it off.
Their poison is strong enough to eat through\nthe hull of a tanker, and they spit it indiscriminately\nat anything that enters their territory.
They knock down flying prey by firing\ncompressed water from their massive\nclaws like shooting a pistol.
Their enormous claws launch cannonballs of\nwater powerful enough to pierce tanker hulls.
They make their home in deserts. They can\ngenerate their energy from basking in the sun,\nso eating food is not a requirement.
They flare their frills and generate energy.\nA single Heliolisk can generate sufficient\nelectricity to power a skyscraper.
This Pokémon was restored from a fossil.\nIf something happens that it doesn’t like,\nit throws a tantrum and runs wild.
Thanks to its gargantuan jaws, which could shred\nthick metal plates as if they were paper, it was\ninvincible in the ancient world it once inhabited.
This ancient Pokémon was restored\nfrom part of its body that had been\nfrozen in ice for over 100 million years.
The diamond-shaped crystals on its body\nexpel air as cold as -240 degrees Fahrenheit,\nsurrounding its enemies and encasing them in ice.
It sends a soothing aura from its\nribbonlike feelers to calm fights.
Although its body is small, its proficient\nfighting skills enable it to keep up with\nbig bruisers like Machamp and Hariyama.
Its whiskers serve as antennas. By sending and\nreceiving electrical waves, it can communicate\nwith others over vast distances.
Born from the temperatures and pressures\ndeep underground, it fires beams from the\nstone in its head.
The weakest Dragon-type Pokémon,\nit lives in damp, shady places, so its\nbody doesn’t dry out.
It drives away opponents by excreting a\nsticky liquid that can dissolve anything.\nIts eyes devolved, so it can’t see anything.
This very friendly Dragon-type Pokémon\nwill hug its beloved Trainer, leaving\nthat Trainer covered in sticky slime.
These key collectors threaten any attackers\nby fiercely jingling their keys at them.
These Pokémon are created when\nspirits possess rotten tree stumps.\nThey prefer to live in abandoned forests.
It can control trees at will. It will trap people\nwho harm the forest, so they can never leave.
The pumpkin body is inhabited by a spirit\ntrapped in this world. As the sun sets,\nit becomes restless and active.
Singing in eerie voices, they wander\ntown streets on the night of the new moon.\nAnyone who hears their song is cursed.
It blocks opponents’ attacks with the\nice that shields its body. It uses cold air\nto repair any cracks with new ice.
Its ice-covered body is as hard as steel.\nIts cumbersome frame crushes anything that\nstands in its way.
They live in pitch-black caves. Their enormous ears\ncan emit ultrasonic waves of 200,000 hertz.
They fly around on moonless nights\nand attack careless prey. Nothing can\nbeat them in a battle in the dark.
Legends say it can share eternal life.\nIt slept for a thousand years in the form\nof a tree before its revival.
When this legendary Pokémon’s wings and\ntail feathers spread wide and glow red,\nit absorbs the life force of living creatures.
When the Kalos region’s ecosystem falls into\ndisarray, it appears and reveals its secret power.
A sudden transformation of Carbink,\nits pink, glimmering body is said to be\nthe loveliest sight in the whole world.
This troublemaker sends anything\nand everything to faraway places\nusing its loop, which can warp space.
It lets out billows of steam and disappears into\nthe dense fog. It’s said to live in mountains\nwhere humans do not tread.

Best of Sinnoh TV\c\nI was just your average girl until I was\nstruck by a Thunder Shock.\c\nIt was love at first sight, baby!\nAnd my target, a Gym Leader!\c\nI didn’t have any Pokémon then, but\nnot a problem for a resourceful gal!\c\nThe answer was simple--and we\nall know simple is best!\c\nI just had to become a Trainer.\nThat’s all it took for me!\c\n“The Diary of a Poké Romantic” will soon\nmake its debut!\c\nThe pilot episode: “Love at First\nSight: The Rules of the Move Attract!”\c\nBy the way, how did everyone get their\nfirst Pokémon anyway?\c\n...
Best of Sinnoh TV\c\nAfter some fits and starts, a childhood\nfriend gave me my first Pokémon!\c\n...It was a Kricketot.\nExcept...I don’t like the legs of bugs.\c\nI bet he gave me this because I picked\non him when he was little...\c\nBut though the road has been long and\nhard, I’m finally at the starting line!\c\nNext week: “The Diary of a Poké\nRomantic,” episode two!\c\n“The Maiden in Love and the Kricketot:\nThe Magic of Romance Never Ends!”\c\nOh, this Kricketot is a female.\nMaybe we can be friends.\c\n...
Best of Sinnoh TV\c\nI checked out my Kricketot and learned\nabout its moves.\c\n...It only knows Growl and Bide.\nThat’s worse than just challenging!\c\nI was about to say that, when my\nchildhood friend stopped me.\c\n“Let it hold an Oran Berry so that\nit can survive while using Bide.”\c\nHey, that’s smart!\nThat’s from a former Bug Catcher!\c\nWhile we’re at it, may I have\nan Oran Berry, too?\c\nNext week: “The Diary of a Poké\nRomantic,” episode three!\c\n“Love Conquers All: Covering Weakness\nwith Ideas!”\c\nWe’re a Trainer and Pokémon now!\nWe’ll get stronger together!\c\n...
Best of Sinnoh TV\c\nI had my first ever Pokémon battle,\nand it ended badly...\c\nMy childhood friend, a former\nBug Catcher, had this to say...\c\n“Pokémon get tougher by battling.\nThe key to victory is type matchups.”\c\nType matchups?\nTypes affect battles?\c\nThe only type matchup I care about is\nwith that Gym Leader!\c\nNext week: “The Diary of a Poké\nRomantic,” episode four!\c\n“Type Matchups Settle Battles!\nMoves That Exploit Weak Points!”\c\nFire, Flying, and Rock...\nKricketot has some disadvantages!\c\n...
Best of Sinnoh TV\c\nWe’d win a battle, and lose one.\nLose one, then win one.\c\nThough it was at times discouraging, I had to\nkeep battling to toughen us up.\c\nWith me and Kricketot, it was always\nthree steps forward, two steps back.\c\nBut we were getting stronger. Then, one\nday, Kricketot started to shine!\c\nNext week: “The Diary of a Poké\nRomantic,” episode five!\c\n“Kricketot Becomes Kricketune! Watch\nMe! I’ll Change, Too!”\c\nAnd to cancel Evolution, press the\nB Button... Tell me that first!\c\n...
Best of Sinnoh TV\c\nAfter Kricketot evolved, it became\nstronger as Kricketune.\c\nWe also got other Pokémon, so we could\ngo farther and farther from home.\c\nBut where is my beloved Gym Leader?\nWhere is that city he said he’s from?\c\nI do have the Town Map, but maps\nbaffle me.\c\nIt doesn’t matter, though.\nIf we keep moving, we’ll get somewhere.\c\nNext week: “The Diary of a Poké\nRomantic,” episode six!\c\n“How Is This Possible? Pokémon Gyms\nCan’t Be Found Everywhere!”\c\nThe more lost you are, the less useful\na map becomes! You know it’s true!\c\n...
Best of Sinnoh TV\c\nOur journey was long, and it was hard.\nBut no one wants to hear that!\c\nSo, I finally found my Gym Leader.\nBut he has an incurable disease!\c\nHe begged me, out of the blue, with his\nlast wish.\c\nHe asked for my Pokémon!\nBut my Kricketune’s my partner!\c\nNext week: “The Diary of a Poké\nRomantic,” episode seven!\c\n“My Trail of Footprints Shortened\nthe Distance Between Us!”\c\nEvery time I see Kricketune’s face, I\nam reminded of our time together...\c\n...
Best of Sinnoh TV\c\nMy beloved Gym Leader, whom I\nfought so hard to meet, was a fraud!\c\nHow dare he con this pure maiden!\nHow dare he toy with my emotions!\c\nBut whose fault was it?\nWas it mine for being taken in?\c\nAll I know is that my tears overflow,\nand despair is my world...\c\nNext week: “The Diary of a Poké\nRomantic,” episode eight!\c\n“Kricketune and I! Our Bond Is True!”\c\nThat Gym Leader’s eating a Giga Impact\nfor playing me for a fool!\c\n...
Best of Sinnoh TV\c\nHaving defeated the fake Gym Leader,\nKricketune and I stood in a daze.\c\nWe were spent. Drained by a romance\nthat ended in a nightmare.\c\nIt was then that my childhood friend, the\nformer Bug Catcher, arrived.\c\nHe did more than that.\nHe confessed his love to me!\c\n“I wanted to become an Elite Four\nmember, so I quit as a Gym Leader.\c\nBut then that faker appeared.\nYou took care of him, though!”\c\nWait, ex-Bug Catcher! What?\nWhat are you saying?!\c\nNext week: “The Diary of a Poké\nRomantic,” final episode!\c\n“Do it, Kricketune! Silver Wind over\nSinnoh Skies!”\c\nYou were laughing at me for falling for\nthat fraud, weren’t you?\c\n...

My swarm of Bug-type Pokémon is in\ntip-top shape and buzzin’ for a battle!
Now you’ve really gone and stirred up the hive!
Man, you and your Pokémon don’t pull any\npunches, do you?\c\nIt’s OK! I’m the same way. I hate losing to\nanyone, so I always give it my all!
You have proven to be a wall that\nI am unable to surmount!
Y’know what? Climbing is a lot like solving\na puzzle. It’s a game of logic!
You’re a tricky one! Truly a mountain that\nI couldn’t surmount!
Maybe I should start by getting in\nbetter shape if I want to improve.
I’m ready to go! If you think you can find\na weakness in my defense, come at me!
Unhh! A battle is a battle--you’re gonna come\nat me whether you find a weakness or not...
The best way to be prepared for any kind of battle\nis to have lots of different Pokémon trained up.
I need a break after all this climbing and training!
No pain, no gain!
You need to keep moving forward.\nIf you stop, you’ll never reach your goal.
Only those with a noble spirit can try to take on\nthe challenge of the Cyllage City Pokémon Gym.
This Gym was waiting for\na Trainer and Pokémon like you!
You need to challenge yourself...\c\nI can tell that you and your Pokémon have\nstrong enough spirits to understand that!
I hope the sun is shining tomorrow...\nThat would be reason enough to smile.

Tee hee hee! Such weak prey! You’ve been\ncaught right up in my Spider Web!
Ahh... No fair!\nMy web wasn’t strong enough to keep you!
Don’t you think there’s something romantic about\nchasing after glimmering droplets of water?
Hey! Are you a challenger?\nCome on--show me your Pokémon!
You get to see all kinds of Pokémon\nby hanging out in a Gym!
Up, down, left, right, crisscross... Spider Webs go\nin all directions! The diagonal parts are the best!
Do you have any idea how quickly\nBug-type Pokémon evolve?
Wow! You evolve quickly, too!
Bug-type Pokémon evolve so quickly,\nI just can’t keep up!
You and your Pokémon have shown me a whole\nnew depth of field! Fantastic! Just fantastic!
What a strange Trainer you are.\nIt was an honor to be able to battle you!
A status condition doesn’t faze a capable tactician!\nHey, that kinda rhymed! Go, me!
That’s right!\nIt takes a certain strength to say yes!
It’s a Trainer’s wit that allows\nhis or her Pokémon to win!
I’m always grinning to make it\nlook like I have confidence!
You and your Pokémon have\nwhat it takes to get to the top!
Now that was an invigorating battle,\nfit for a Pokémon Gym!
My oh my--aren’t you and your Pokémon\njust the best of partners?
What love you have for your Pokémon!\nGood! Great! Fabulous!
I hope this experience will help\nyou grow even stronger.
What I’ve been able to confirm is just\nhow great you and your Pokémon are!
I must accept reality, or else I’ll never\nget any better!

Your passion for battle inspires me!
Hey, hey! You’ve gotta have some impressive\nskating skills in order to have caught up to me!\c\nYou won’t show me up in battle, though!
What?! No way! You’ve got me beat\nin Pokémon battles, too?
A stellar skater and a first-class battler...\nSheesh...I just can’t measure up to you!
You look like you could use some lessons!\c\nDon’t worry--when it comes to speed skating and\nPokémon battling, you won’t find a better teacher!
Looks like I’ve got nothing to teach you\nthat you don’t already know!
Don’t worry about me!\nI’ve got my Pokémon friends here to cheer me up!
This skate-and-battle train doesn’t stop for anyone!\nNonstop and full speed ahead! Go, go, go!
You stopped me right in my tracks!\nThat’s no fun!
Having to stop on top of losing to you!\nThis is like the worst day EVER!
Just who do you think you are,\nstopping me while I’m skating?!
Oh, you stopped me because you wanted a battle?\nWhy didn’t you just say so?
Taking a spill every once in a while is part of\nbeing a skater, just like losing a battle every\r\nonce in a while is part of being a Trainer!
How could it be?!
Oof. I’d kind of forgotten how strong you are.
Oof. I’d kind of forgotten how strong you are.
Oof. I’d kind of forgotten how strong you are.
As a Pokémon Trainer,\nI find you really interesting.
As a Pokémon Trainer,\nI find you really interesting.
As a Pokémon Trainer,\nI find you really interesting.
Behold--the power of green!\nThe power of nature!
From where do you get your power?
Maybe if we grew more trees and shrubs around\nhere, our Grass-type Pokémon would get stronger!
Here to challenge the Gym, are you?\nLet’s see your Pokémon, then!
What excellent Pokémon you have!
Keep on climbing--right to the top!\c\nHard to believe that old man Ramos goes up\nand down this thing every day!
My Pokémon and I will share\nthe joy of defeating you!
And now comes the flood of tears of regret!
You know, it’s my Pokémon that wipe away\nmy tears after a frustrating defeat!
To realize our true potential, my Pokémon and I\nmust become connected on an emotional level!
It looks like you and your Pokémon are even\nmore in tune with one another than my team is!
I never forget the bitter taste of defeat!\c\nIt’s something I don’t want my Pokémon to\nexperience ever again!
Yeh can’t take things too quickly when it comes\nto forming a friendship with yer Pokémon, sprout!
Don’t be distracted by your surroundings.\nFocus on unleashing your true power.
Yes! When you remain calm and undistracted,\nyour Pokémon can realize their full potential.
I’ll never regret becoming a Trainer. After all,\nI’d never have met my Pokémon otherwise.
You can go anywhere as\nlong as you never give up!
There may not be anyone who can stand\nin the way of you and your Pokémon!
It’s easy to get lost in this enigma of a Gym...\c\nDon’t you get the feeling that you’ve been\ndown this path before?
I had a vision that the battle we are about to\nhave will be different from all previous battles!
You and your Pokémon look like you know\nhow to share your burdens with one another.
Whether it was due to the guidance of the\nstars or the merit of my work that I’m here,\r\nI’m joyful that I was able to meet my Pokémon\r\nand come to battle against you!
[~ 121]
[~ 122]
[~ 123]
Being able to keep your cool no matter the\nsituation is a trademark of the truly powerful.
You’ve got my blood boiling now!\nI think this ice is gonna melt!
You lose your cool, and you’re as good as beaten.\nI know this all too well, but it’s hard to maintain!\c\nWhen I run into a strong Trainer like you,\nI can’t stop my battling spirit from flaring up!
Freeze right there!
You’ve frozen my heart solid!
You think strength justifies all, do you?!\c\nWell, I suppose it does...\nThis is a Pokémon Gym, after all.
I like to cool down and clear my head\nwith a refreshing chilled dessert!\r\nHere, let me give you a taste!
I could really go for an ice-cold\nsherbet right about now!
I’ll tell you a secret...\c\nTry using Ice Beam on some\nBerry Juice for a delicious frappé!\c\nHey! You gotta get to know your Pokémon\nand their moves outside of battles, right?
They call me the queen of the ice rink!
Colder than cold!\nFaster than fast!
It would probably make more sense if I were\nactually at an ice rink...
Outstanding! I’m tough as an iceberg, but\nyou smashed me through and through!
Your Pokémon are in for a shock!
Eep! I was the one who got shocked!
Not just anyone can find a Pikachu, you know?\nIt’s OK--you don’t have to compliment me!
Come on, Scatterbug--let’s powder this punk!
Cheer up, Scatterbug! We lost this time, but we’ll\nget the next one who comes along for sure!
Keep lots of types of Pokémon with you, and you’ll\nnever get caught off guard by a type weakness.
When two Trainers’ eyes meet,\na Pokémon battle must begin!
You should’ve told me that you were THAT strong!
Time to get in some practice with the\nwild Pokémon in the tall grass!\c\nOh! I’d better heal up my Pokémon first!
[~ 146]
[~ 147]
[~ 148]
[~ 149]
You may have beaten me, but when I lose,\nI go out in style!
Go, Team Flare!
We’re Team Flare!\nWe put the fashion into fear!
Go, go, Team Flare!\n...Oh, I lost? I guess I’ll stop cheering now.
Oh man! My favorite, fashionable\nTeam Flare suit is filthy!
We’re gonna take everyone else down\nso we can do what WE want!
Hey!\nYou weren’t supposed to beat me!
You should keep your nose\nout of adults’ business, kid!
We were looking for Fossils\nbut discovered a kid!
You’ve made me so sad!\nI think I’m gonna cry!
If we can restore Fossils, we can make\nsome good money!\c\nWhen you’ve got money, you can\ndo whatever you like!
To tell you the truth, I’m thinking of\nnever leaving this place.
To tell you the truth, I’m not even sure\nif this place is real!
To tell you the truth, I’m so enchanted by\nmy reflection here, I’m thinking of never\r\nleaving this place!
Mirror, mirror on the wall, who’s\nthe strongest of them all?
So, you’re the strongest Trainer!
Next, I’m going to try challenging my own\nreflection to see who’s stronger!
Whose shadow stands on the walls of\nReflection Cave? ’Tis that of a Hiker!
This battle got my clothes in such a disarray!\nI’d better use this mirror here to tidy up!
What Pokémon comes to mind for you when\nyou hear the word “mirror”? For me, it’s Bronzor!
My only desire is to brighten my Pokémon’s\nday by defeating you in battle!
I’ve made my Pokémon sad...\nIt’s all my fault! I’m too weak...
Here’s a tip for you!\c\nGo down the hill up ahead, and you’ll return\nto Route 11.
Ace Trainer?\nI don’t know about all that. I just love Pokémon!
As a fellow Pokémon lover, you’re an ace yourself!
My heart is filled with my love for Pokémon!
Since ancient times, mirrors have always\npossessed a kind of mystical power.\c\nI will take advantage of that power and\nuse it to defeat you!
The mystical power bounced back and\ndefeated me instead!
One look at your Pokémon, and I can\ntell what kind of Trainer you are...\c\nYou might say that Pokémon are a sort\nof mirror to their Trainers.
BATTLE!
DESPAIR!
TRAIN!
Oh no... Just where has my darling gone off to?\nSob...
I... I can’t win without my darling!\nSob...
I’m completely lost without my darling!\nSob...
I left my darling fiancé behind and came\nover here all by myself.
Ooh, you’re so strong!\nPerhaps even stronger than my fiancé.
I like to leave my fiancé behind and wander off by\nmyself sometimes. He’s so cute when he’s scared!
What do you think, honey? Should we share some\nof our happiness with this young Trainer?
Do we really look so happy?\nHmm...
Yuu: I don’t mind if I lose! As long as I’m with\nmy darling, I feel like I’m on top of the world!\c\nAmi: Well... I suppose I am rather happy.
My Pokémon on one side and my wife on the other.\nI tell you, life doesn’t get much better than this!
Is it selfish of me to not be satisfied\nwith what I have?
You wouldn’t stand a chance against the power\nof our happiness with just one Pokémon!
Only one Pokémon?\nI think you’re going to need more than that...
A Worker in a cave...\nRather picturesque if I do say so myself.
You and your Pokémon make quite the picture, too!
A cave that’s completely untouched... Just imagine\nwhat kind of treasures might be hidden in here!\r\nBwa ha ha! I’m such a romantic.
Huh? What’re you looking at? I’m gonna\nmake you help me work if you lose!
That battle was a good sweat! Even a\nbetter workout than all of this diggin’!
Diggin’ all day, every day. I tell you what--\nthis job is like paradise for Graveler.
Hey, hey!\nCan’t you see I’m working here?
Oh no! Oh no!\nI’d better get back to work now!
The damp air in this cave makes my clothes\nstick to my skin. Anyway, back to work!\c\nHeave ho! Heave ho!
Ho ho ho. ♪\nHo ho ho. ♪\c\nI dropped my book while I was running across.\nYou see, it was the un-a-bridged version! Ho ho. ♪
Ho ho ho. ♪ I never hold a grudge.\nIt’s all water under the bridge!
One of these days I’m going to get in trouble for\nall of these dumb jokes!\c\nI guess I’ll cross that bridge when I get there!\nHo ho ho. ♪
Did you see that Hiker on top of the bridge?\c\nHe’s been running back and forth like that\nfor the last couple of days...\r\nI wonder if he’s all right...
Come to think of it, I’ve been standing here in\nthe same spot for the last couple of days, too!
Don’t worry about that Hiker on the bridge.\c\nYou can go on ahead. I’ll be sure to stick\naround and keep an eye on him!
People often say, “It’s the beginning of the end.”\nWhatever do they mean?
Even if I lose, it’s not the end...\nCould that be what it means?
Perhaps it’s only the end when there’s\nnothing left...\c\nBut if “nothing” is left, then that means there’s\n“something”! Hmm...
Hi-yah! All will tremble as my manly roar\nechoes throughout this cave!
Grawwwooohhh! My howl of pain will be\nheard by all in this cave!
All this talk of roaring and howling brings the\nHyper Voice move to mind!\c\nUse it in a Double or Triple Battle to hit multiple\nopponents at once! Rraaarrr!
Boom! One Final Gambit Low Sweep\nright where it counts!
Ohhh! That was a cracking Arm Thrust Counter\nif I do say so myself!
Ha ha! Combining move names makes them\nsound so cool!\c\nI came up with it, though! Don’t copy me, OK?
Breathe in... Breathe out... Deep breaths...\c\nOK! Let’s battle!
Breathe in... Breathe out... Deep breaths...\c\nThank you for the battle!
Breathe in... Breathe out... Deep breaths...\c\nBreathe in... Breathe o... Cough...\c\nThe oxygen in here is a bit thin, no?
We’re a pair of wanderers, on a journey through\nKalos with our trusty Pokémon!\c\nOne of our favorite pastimes is to battle with the\nTrainers we encounter on our journey.
Pokémon are like treasured jewels strewn\nthroughout the land.\c\nIt’s in battle where they truly get a chance\nto shine!
Fern: Your Pokémon shine more brightly\nthan any jewel I’ve ever seen!\c\nLee: You look like you’ve been to quite a\nfew places in Kalos.
We’re a pair of wanderers, on a journey through\nKalos with Nidoking and our other trusty Pokémon!\c\nWhether we win or we lose, we make sure to learn\nfrom every battle and improve ourselves!
Can you feel the vibrations in the air? It’s almost\nas if this abandoned mine is alive and breathing...
You came all this way with just one Pokémon?\nI’m impressed!
We wouldn’t be able to show off our trademark\nteamwork against just one Pokémon!
Seriously, though.\nWho are you?\c\nOnly authorized personnel are allowed\nin here!
I’ll ask you again... Just who are you?
Who do you think you are?\c\nTeam Flare is busy...redirecting...the power\nthat’s supposed to go to Lumiose City, see?\c\nDon’t get in our way!
Are you trying to play us for a fool, kid?\nYou don’t seriously think you can just barge in here\r\nand take us on all by yourself, do you?
I can’t believe I lost to some little kid.\nI must look like such a fool.
What is with you anyway? You’re a fool if you\nthink you can do anything all by yourself!
If my analysis is correct--and it always is--this\nbattle is 100 percent a failure on my part.
Hey! Stop right there, intruder!\nI’ll warn you now--I can be persistent!
Hrmph! I lost on purpose!
Now I’m mad! I told you I was persistent!\nI refuse to budge from this spot! Not an inch!
Oh, I sure do love me a good happening!\c\nI love the feel of accomplishment that\ncomes with overcoming a challenge!
Now you’re a Trainer who knows how to\nbring a good happening!
My life is full of happenings...\nMaybe that’s not so bad, though!
Aren’t these sunglasses the coolest? I bet you’re\njealous! Too bad--you can’t have them!
The future doesn’t look very bright for me! Oh!\nI wonder if it’s because I’m wearing sunglasses.
It’s as if I was looking at you through\nrose-colored glasses!
Go, Team Flare! Go, go, Team Flare!\nF to the L to the A to the R to the E!\r\nF-L-A-R-E! We bring it! You know it!
...Go, Team Flare, go!\n...Go, go, Team Flare!
Simple defeat won’t stop me from cheering!\c\nGo, Team Flare! Go, go, Team Flare!\nF to the L to the A to the R to the E!
What do I want to do?\c\nHmmm... How about inflicting some\nserious pain on your Pokémon?
I only succeeded in hurting MY Pokémon!
You should do what you wanna do, too!
You’ll not get past me! My pride\nis enough to keep you at bay!
Losing to you doesn’t mean anything!\nMy pride remains unscathed!
I may not have been able to stop you,\nbut I ain’t apologizing to nobody!\c\nThe person up top who assigned me\nto this post is at fault--not me!
You’re quite strong.\nOh yes--very strong, indeed.
The best way to learn about a move\nis to have your Pokémon use it!
Wow! That move packs a punch, all right!
A move’s power can change depending\non the target it hits!
Mommy told me that I should battle\nanyone who greets me!
Mommy told me to be polite,\nespecially when I lose!
Mommy didn’t tell me to, but I’m\ngoing to play with my Pokémon!
Pokémon battles are really hard...\nI just let Pichu do what it wants.
Pichu, did we lose?
I’m gonna go ask Viola to teach me\nhow to battle!\c\nShe’s so cool! She’s the Gym Leader in\nSantalune City!
Hey! My Pokémon and I are studying!\nWanna join us?
Just studying isn’t enough! I need to\npractice more with real battles!
I’d better go to the Trainers’ School\nand learn everything from scratch!
I can tell by the look on your face that\nyou just love Pokémon!
This battle made it even more clear to me!\nYou really love Pokémon!
Pokémon can be difficult at times, but everything\nwill be OK if you show them that you love them!
I love my Pokémon. ♪\nI love my Pokémon. ♪
You and your Pokémon look like you have\nsomething stronger than mere love!
Even if you can’t communicate with words, you can\nstill have a loving relationship with your Pokémon!
I’m warnin’ ya, youngster--my Corphish here\nhas some sharp pincers!
Ohhh! You cut us right down to size!
To keep this garden lookin’ fine and proper, it’s\nimportant to have the right kinds of Pokémon!
Behold these glorious moves that have been\nhoned and perfected in the garden!
Looks like your combination with your Pokémon\nwas even more honed than mine!
If you run into Ramos from Coumarine City on\nyour travels, give him my best, will ya?
Parterre Way is famous for these hedgerow\ngardens! If you can defeat me, I’ll tell what their\r\nofficial name is!
I’m a pro when it comes to gardens.\nYou’re a pro when it comes to Pokémon!
As promised, I’ll tell you the official name!\nThey’re known as geometric gardens!

C’mon, Goldeen! Let’s show them\nwhat we’re made of!
Goldeen, Marill, I’m so sorry! I’ll get you both\nhealed right up at the Pokémon Center!
I just love Water-type Pokémon!\c\nSome of the Grass- and Fire-type Pokémon\nare cute, too!
I care less about battling than just showing off\nmy awesome Pokémon to everyone!
Oh no! Flabébé, are you OK?\nIt’s all my fault! I’m so sorry!
Isn’t my Flabébé just the cutest thing ever?

Check it out! I just traded for a cool new Pokémon!
Splish, splash...\nSplish, splash, splosh...
I just received Magikarp in a trade, so we\nhaven’t gotten used to each other yet!
Hey! Hey! Listen!\nI’m gonna win this battle!
Come on! No fair!\nYou weren’t supposed to win!
No, I’m not mad! I’m just going to\ntrain my Budew even more!

I battle just like I skate! Nonstop victory is\nthe only way for me!
Wow! You’ve got some crazy Pokémon there!\nMind if I put some roller skates on them?
It doesn’t get much better than Lumiose City for\nus skaters! The streets are wide and the pavement\r\nis smooth--it’s perfect for skating!
I love Pokémon battles, but they’d be even better\nif I didn’t have to stop skating!
The moment I stop, down flutters the Fletchling!
I took up roller skating so I could chase after\nthe Fletchling that fly around here.
You look like a seasoned traveler!\nI bet you’re good at battling, too!
You’re just as good as I thought!
Seasoned travelers stride with confidence.\nI can identify one at a glance!
People say we’re like two peas in a pod!
They say we’re two halves of a whole!
Faith: Ahh...\c\nJoy: Umm...
What’s a “dubbel-battel”? Can you eat it?\nIs it tasty?
What’s “co-opper-ashun”?\nPokémon battles are hard...
You’re silly! You can’t play with\njust one Pokémon!
Nuh uh! We can’t have a “dubbel-battel”\nagainst just one Pokémon!
I haven’t been able to sleep very well for days!\nI don’t know if I’m up for a battle...
I knew it...\nI really gotta get some sleep!
It’s impossible to get a wink in with\nthe Vital Spirit Ability!

The rules of a Pokémon battle are simple, you see.\nRule one: battle. Rule two: win!
You followed the rules perfectly!
Route 5 is our street, you know?\nWe call it Versant Road...\c\nIt’s the place to be if you want to see some\nsick skating tricks and hot Pokémon moves!
I’m working on some synchronized tricks with my\nPokémon, but we can’t get our timing right...\c\nLet me practice against you!
Gah!
I just want to come up with a stylish trick that\nworks in both Bunnelby’s and Skiddo’s cool moves!
Hi! Wanna know why I always wear shorts\nwhen I walk through the tall grass?
Because they’re comfy and easy to wear!
I really like shorts! You should totally\ngive them a try sometime!
Shorts are the coolest!\nAnd the comfiest!
Whenever I’m feeling down after losing a battle,\nI just think, “At least I’ve still got my shorts!”
I couldn’t think of wearing anything but shorts.\nHow do other people do it?
Let’s start a secret battle\nin the tall grass!
Oh, you’re very strong.\nWhat a surprise!
Why do I wrap myself in tall grass?\nBecause I want to be a Pokémon!
This tall grass is taller than I am! Yer tellin’\nme there’re Pokémon lurkin’ in here?
Bwa ha ha! I love findin’ myself a Trainer stronger\nthan I am! Gives me somethin’ to work toward.
I’m gonna keep travelin’ this wide world of ours\nand try to find more strong Trainers like you!
I came all the way from the Unova region\nto see Parfum Palace!
Man... Talk about culture shock...
I tell ya, you really need to get out there and see\nthe world for yourself to really understand it.
Today is the day that I begin my path to becoming\nthe Champion! I’ll start things off by defeating you!
Hmm...\nMaybe I should start tomorrow.
I’ll be the Champion someday...\nYou’ll see! You’ll all see!
Zoom! Zoom! Zoom!\nWith my shorts on, I can run like the wind!
You may have defeated me, but that’s\nnot gonna stop me from running! Zoom!
Zoom! Zoom! Zoom!\c\nSecret training in the tall grass!\nDoduo ain’t got nothin’ on me!
Think you can defeat a man at the peak of\nhis happiness? Think again!
A little defeat like this won’t get me down!\nI’m on my honeymoon, after all!
A tree-lined lane is the perfect spot to pledge\nyour dedication to your partner! That goes for\r\nTrainers and their Pokémon, too!
I’m determined to see everything Kalos has\nto offer! Come on--bring out your Pokémon!
Wow! You’re really good! Are you a famous\nperson in these parts?
They should really write about you in\na travel guidebook!
Why do I travel? Why do I battle?\nAllow me to demonstrate!
Did you see your Pokémon smile just now?
I travel around the world, because I just\nlove seeing Pokémon smile!
I bet you thought I was just some unassuming\nTourist! I happen to be a seasoned battler, too!
Wha-what?!
I wish I could take your Pokémon home with me!\c\nJust joking! Just joking! I couldn’t separate your\nPokémon from a fabulous Trainer like you!
Tee hee hee! Come join us for a Pokémon battle!\nI’m confident that you’ll love your Pokémon even\r\nmore after we’re done!
Har har har! I can see it on your face!\nI can feel it in the air around you!\c\nYou’re a Trainer who loves h[VAR GENDBR(00FF,0202)]iser Pokémon!
Erin: Now I’m head over heels for your\nfantastic Pokémon!\c\nJan: Har har har! Good effort, my beloved Furfrou!\nYou’re the best!
When it comes to who loves their Pokémon more,\nI’m afraid I’m in the lead over my husband!\r\nOnly by one point, though!
I’ve been competing with my wife over which one\nof us loves our Furfrou the most!\r\nI think we’re pretty even at this point!
It’s great that you trust your Pokémon so much,\nbut you’ll need more than one to battle us.
Oh... You’ve only got one Pokémon fit for battle\nwith you? Come back when you have more!
A blank canvas before me and yet no inspiration\nfrom which to paint!
I’ve got it!
A blank canvas means the possibilities are endless!\c\nI believe I’ll paint the comings and goings of\nTrainers like you along this fine Rivière Walk!
A heated battle against a traveling Trainer should\nprovide me with just the inspiration I need!
Excellent! Thanks! It’s been ages since I worked\nup a good sweat like this from a Pokémon battle.
The passion of our battle will surely inspire\nme to paint something astonishing!
So, I’m good at raising Pokémon, and\nyou’re good at Pokémon battles. Right?
Whoa... You’re good at both raising Pokémon\nand battling! Impressive!
Any Pokémon you leave at the Pokémon Day Care\nwill continue to learn moves while you’re away.\c\nSo, be careful! You might come back one day\nand find that your Pokémon has forgotten a\r\nmove that you wanted it to keep!
How well have you raised your Pokémon?\nLet’s have a battle, and I’ll let you know!
Mmm hmm! You’re really good at this\nwhole Pokémon-raising thing!
Remember--Pokémon will never evolve while\nin the Pokémon Day Care.
Check out my awesome kimono! It’s a famous\ndesign from the Johto region.
Johto kimonos are the coolest!
Thanks to Laverre City’s Gym Leader, Valerie,\nand her amazing designs, kimono fashion\r\nis becoming really popular in Kalos!
They’re just stones, right?
Definitely just stones, don’t you think?
Yeah... What else would they be but stones?
You there! You’re the perfect model\nfor our next painting!
Show us a magnificent display in battle\nto get this painting started!
Mona: Yahoo! This is gonna be our best work yet!\c\nPaolo: I’ll never forget our battle together!
This canvas will come alive with the\nexcitement of our battle!
After getting inspiration from an exhilarating battle,\nit’s almost like my brush moves on its own!
Come back when you have more Pokémon\nready to battle with you!
I want to see even more of your Pokémon!\nCome back with more, please!
Swish! Swish! Swish!\c\nYou wouldn’t believe how much I’ve practiced my\ncasting technique! Time to see the results!
Swish! Swish!\nI guess I need more practice...
Swish! Swish! Swish!\c\nI guess practicing my casting technique doesn’t\nreally have anything to do with Pokémon battles...
You’re a big one, all right! I can tell from my\nyears of experience as a Fisherman!
I knew you were a big one! I could tell from my\nmany years as a Fisherman!
When you have many years of experience like me,\nyou can tell a lot of things in life!
No matter how much we fish, the ocean\nstays blue.\c\nSo, does the ground never change\nno matter how much we battle?
Defeat! Oh, woe is me! I’ll sink this feeling\nof despair to the bottom of the ocean!
I’m too scared of the deep parts,\nso I just stick to the shallows.
My Machop and I walk these mountain paths in\nour bare feet! Think you can take us on?
Hrmm... It appears that building a thick skin on\none’s feet does not make one stronger in battle...
It’s great to feel the earth between your toes!\nWalking around in bare feet is the best!
We’re flying high!\nHigh as the sky!
We’re falling down!\nDown to the ground!
You blasted us off high into the sky!
Preparations completed!\nIt’s Sky Battle time!
Ahh... The wide-open sky...\nIt goes on as far as the eye can see...
Time to use Roost along with\nmy Jumpluff!
Onward to the wild blue yonder!\nA new world awaits!
I’m still not used to this whole\nSky Battle thing...
You look as if you’re ready to free yourself from\nthe restrictions of gravity and set off for the stars!
I’m afraid I’ve got the home advantage when it\ncomes to battling in the water! Don’t drown, OK?
Awk... Gasp... Gak...\nUgh... You sank me good!
I wish I could swim in the shallow parts...\nActually, I wish I could swim on the ground, too!
Think you got what it takes to\nswim the great ocean?
With strength like that,\nyou won’t have any problems!
Pokémon are always nearby, ready to save\npeople from drowning, but that doesn’t mean\r\nyou shouldn’t learn how to swim properly!
Normally I’d sink like a brick, but when I’m with my\nPokémon, swimming is no problem at all!
Hey! I told you I’m a poor swimmer!\nThrow me a line!
I love going wading with my web-footed pals!
I’m getting tired of wearing this swimsuit.\nI think I’ll make this my last battle in it!
I’m not tired of wearing swimsuits--just of this one!\nAll I need to do is buy a new one!
I wonder which town’s boutique\nI should shop at for my new swimsuit!\c\nEach boutique carries different colors,\nso it’s hard to make up my mind!
I was just about to set off on a swimming marathon\nwith my girlfriend and our Pokémon!
Oh, great! You’re just in time to provide us\nwith some good warm-up exercises!
Kai: Ugh... I think I pulled a muscle!\c\nLani: Whew... I’m completely spent!\nI think I gotta lie down.
As long as you’re prepared,\nyou can take on anything!
After a battle like that,\nI’d say a nap is called for!
You’re gonna need more than just one\nPokémon if you hope to defeat us!
You’re not prepared at all! Come back when you\nhave more than one Pokémon with you!
“Dream big” is what I say! You’re looking at the\nfuture Champion, after all! Bring it on!
Wha-wha-what?! Perhaps that future-Champion\nstuff is all just a dream in the end...
OK. I’ll settle for being part of the Elite Four!\nOK. OK. I’ll settle for being a Gym Leader.\c\nBut then again, I did say I should dream big...\nGot it! I’ll be the BEST Gym Leader in the world!
According to my predictions, this victory\nis as good as mine! Now to put them to the test!
Hmm... That certainly didn’t go as it did\nin my predictions...
If I keep up these predictions, I’m sure\nreality will eventually catch up to me!
With my rubber flying suit, I can completely\nshrug off Electric-type moves!
Wait! It doesn’t matter if I’M wearing the suit...\nIt’s my Pokémon that are taking the hits!
Figuring out how to defend against Electric-type\nmoves is a never-ending challenge for Flying types!
I can feel the energy from these stones enhancing\nmy already potent psychic powers!
I couldn’t control my overflowing power!
I wonder what relationship these Route 10\nstones have with energy...
Stop right there! I remember you!\nYou’re the one who foiled our Fossil-finding plans!\c\nAll right! Time for me to get some sweet revenge...\nWith style!
You may have beaten me...again. But when\nI lose, I go out in style!
What the... How could I lose again to\na little punk like you?\c\nWhat are you, some kind of Trainer prodigy\nor something?
You inspect the stones...\nI inspect YOU!
As a result of my inspection, I can tell\nthat you’re stronger than I am!
Strong you may be, but this stylish Team Flare\nsuit would simply not look good on you.
Can’t you see we adults are busy?\nDon’t interrupt our work, kid!
Well, if that’s how you’re going to be,\nI’ll just stop working! Harrumph!
Is discovering the secrets of these stones\nreally a job for adults?
To have a battle at a famous sightseeing spot!\nOh, this will make for a great memory!
It doesn’t matter that I lost! I’ll treasure\nthis memory forever.
They call them standing stones because\nthey’re standing up in a row.\c\nThat’s what my travel guide says, at least!
This place is flowing with power.\nI often come here to recharge!
Wow! You and your Pokémon’s power levels\nare incredible! They’re over 9,000 for sure!
I want to find out what these stones have to do\nwith the energy levels in this area.
A Battle Girl’s power comes from\nher belt, you know?
Gotta keep my belt tied tight, or\nI can’t unleash my true power!
With an Expert Belt, supereffective moves do\n20 percent more damage! Cool, huh?\c\nThat’s not all! With a Black Belt, Fighting-type\nmoves do 20 percent more damage! Belts rule!
I use everything I have as a source of my power:\nmy body, my spirit, and my emotions!
You and your Pokémon were far more powerful\nthan I could have imagined...
I use the power from my body, spirit, and emotions\nto foresee what tactics my opponents may employ!
This suit has been specially designed to reduce\nwind resistance! Off I go!
It appears that the damage resistance\nwas reduced as well!
Perhaps I just need to make my suit tighter...\nYeah, that’s the ticket!
Hi-yah! Ichi! Ni! San!\nAll of my training was for this match!
Rah! Huh! Hi-yah!\nBehold the results of my training!
Frank: Ahh... Ahh...\nArrrggghhh! Waahhh!\c\nSly: It’s going to be OK! Don’t cry!\nWe did our best!
I really need to stop crying every time\nI lose a battle...
You only cry because Pokémon battles are so\nimportant to you! That’s a good thing!
I would never consider a match where the odds are\nunfairly in my favor! Bring more Pokémon!
I’m afraid we can’t battle against you if you only\nhave one Pokémon that’s ready to go.
I grew tired of the city life and decided to wander\nthe world. I’m not aiming for anywhere in particular.
I suppose I won’t find victory in battle either,\nunless I aim for it.
Sometimes I find myself just gazing at the ranch\nand completely lose track of the time.
I like to bury my face in the fur around Tauros’s\nneck and take a big whiff of its scent!\r\nIt’s a jinx for battle, I hear!
Oh, that’s right. A jinx is something that\nbrings you bad luck... Oops!
I wish I could talk with my Pokémon and ask\nthem how they want to be raised.
You’re about to find out just how\nstrong my family is!
Wow... We lost! It looks like your\nfamily was even stronger!
Both Seviper and Miltank are important\nmembers of my family!
Fishing is all about catching and releasing!
I wouldn’t have lost so badly if I just\nreleased sooner!
Catch and release!\nCatch and release!\c\nThat’s what’s important when it\ncomes to fishing!
Swimmin’ alone! Swimmin’ alone!\nOooh yeah!
Losin’ a battle with my Binacle!\nOhhh no!
I love my Binacle and all, but I feel like\nthere’s something missing from my life...\c\nLike a girlfriend... Yeah!\n
Do you like fairy tales or reality more?
I wish I could live inside of a fairy tale...
I can’t wait to read the rest of Shauntal’s\nlatest novel!
I’ve known forever--since my previous life--that\nwe would meet here today and face off!
I lost?! I LOST?! What wizardry is this?!\nDid you somehow rewrite the laws of causality?!
I... I just obey... If that is what\nfate dictates, then I shall obey...
Become one with nature to understand\nhow Pokémon truly feel!
What amazing power! Do you\nunderstand how Pokémon feel?
As long as you have a deep connection with your\nPokémon, there’s no telling how high you can go!
To feel shame is to be alive...\c\nIn attempt to never forget that, I battle against\nTrainers like you.
What incredible power...\nI feel something awakening inside me!
Perhaps... Perhaps I should engage with\nmore living, breathing people...\c\nNature and change... Hmmm...\nAm I evolving?!
Look what I’ve found!\nIt’s a Trainer!
Keep your eyes peeled, and you\nnever know what you’ll find!
Maybe I’ll try mimicking Arbok’s Dig move\nto create a hideout around here.

I only make friends with people from whom\nI can learn something.
Whoa! You’re incredible!\nHey, let’s be friends! I could learn a lot from you!
Sure, I may be nothing special right now...\nBut I’m going to keep learning from my Pokémon\r\nand fellow Trainers!
I get the feeling from you and your Pokémon that\nyou really know your business! Let’s find out!
Wow, you’re good! You took my pride and\nsmashed it to pieces!
And there I went, thinking I had become strong...\nYou beat me badly, and it feels great!\c\nWhat’s destroyed once can be rebuilt!\nOut with the old me and in with the new!
Is Pokémon battling just a hobby to you,\nor do you want to become a pro?
I’ll be sure to learn from this defeat\nand improve myself!
The Pokémon League is close, yet so far away!\c\nTime to put the pressure on myself and my partners\nso we can challenge it sooner rather than later!
I learned all of my Pokémon-battling techniques\nfrom Viola--the Gym Leader!
Whoa! You might be even stronger than Viola!
Viola only raises the types of Pokémon\nthat she likes.\c\nBut you know what? It’s probably a better idea\nto train lots of different types of Pokémon to be\r\nready for any opponent!
You know what this is, right?\nIt’s the beginning of a Pokémon battle.
I may have lost, but that doesn’t devalue\nthe effort my Pokémon put in!
Maybe I should work on training up\nMetapod and having it evolve...\c\nWhen Pokémon evolve, they change\nshape and get stronger!
Go, go, Bunnelby!\nWe’ll do this as a team!
To tell you the truth, Bunnelby is\nthe only Pokémon I’ve got...
Hee hee hee! I just love Bunnelby’s\nfluffy ears! So cute!
Hey! I wasn’t done watching my cute\nLi’l Froakie yet!
Hey! I wasn’t done watching my cute\nLi’l Chespin yet!
Hey! I wasn’t done watching my cute\nLi’l Fennekin yet!
[~ 539]
[~ 540]
[~ 541]
The best part about Pokémon battles is that they\ncan happen anytime, with anyone, anywhere!
I’ve got to keep battling and training up\nmy really awesome Pokémon team!
Duh! I can’t believe I forgot that Potions can\nbe used even during a battle!

[~ 596]
You wrapped up the battle before\nI could reach my top speed!
Don’t we just look like a bunch of\ndolls in a doll house?
You’re no doll! You’re a true\nPokémon Trainer!
Unlike dolls, Pokémon are living, breathing\ncreatures and they can get angry at times.\r\nBut that’s part of what makes them so cute!
I looked up to Valerie so much that I came\nhere to learn from her!
Waaah! Lady Valerie! I need your help!
I still have a lot to learn about both fashion\nand Pokémon battles if I want to be amazing\r\nlike Lady Valerie...
This Furisode Girl had her clothing designed by\nthe one and only Valerie! How do I look?\c\nI must live up to Valerie’s beautiful design by\ndisplaying an equally beautiful battle technique!
So strong...\nSo beautiful...
Things that are truly beautiful are\ndifficult to describe with mere words.
Did you know that a certain type of move has no\neffect against our beloved Fairy-type Pokémon?
There are some types of moves that are\nvery strong against Fairy types, though...
What type of move has no effect against Fairy-type\nPokémon? I think you know the answer...
Glorious! The trust that you share with your\nhonorable Pokémon surpasses even mine!
What news... So a new challenger has\ndefeated Malva of the Elite Four!
Oh, dear me. That sure was a quick battle...\nI do hope you’ll come back again sometime!
I shall store my memory of you and your\nPokémon forever away within my heart.
Witnessing the noble spirits of you and your\nPokémon in battle has really touched my heart...
What an incredible bond you have!\nWhat amazing power!
Tee hee hee...\nIt was just as I imagined!
Oh no... A falling star...\nHave I really fallen so far?
There’s a pain in my chest... Could that be\nthe feeling of my heart being crushed?
I’m so embarrassed by my absolutely\ndisgraceful display...
Aw, I’ve gone and done it this time!\nThat was a right terrible defeat!
Hmph. It seems you’ve got some skill with\nPokémon, despite your total lack of fashion.
It’s kind of, like, refreshing to lose for once.\n’Cause I’ve been such a winner in life, y’know?
Yes! This is what I wanted!\nI just love a good, sound defeat!
Hmm... I didn’t see that one coming.\nYou’re a tricky one indeed!
I gave it my all. There’s nothing left in me!\nAs such, you won’t hear any regrets from me.
Tee hee hee! It’s just like the rumors say--\nyou’re the real thing!
How could it be? Luck was certainly on your\nside to have defeated one so great as I!
I won’t stand for it! Do you have any idea how\nmuch money I’ve poured into these Pokémon?
It’s true that I may have lost this time...\nBut you’ll not best me again!
Heh-heh-heh... Isn’t this a little odd?\nA first-class gentleman wouldn’t lose, right?
Urk!\nIs my secret out?!
I’ve brought shame upon my family’s name!\nI can’t bear to face my father after this...
A true star like me knows how to lose\nwith grace and style!
Maman! You must come at once! I’m in dire\nneed of assistance against this Trainer!
Tsk... However did this happen? How\nundignified of me to lose like this...
Never!\nI shan’t kneel before the likes of you!
Really? Couldn’t you have just lost for me?\nYou sure are stingy with the favors...
My, my...\nIt seems I was perhaps a little hasty.
Impressive...\nYour technique leaves nothing to be desired.
To have defeated a seasoned battler like myself...\nYou’re not just any ordinary child, are you?
Please accept my apologies!\nIt was my master...
So, you are a fine master to your Pokémon...
And now we shall begin. En garde!
Glorious! The trust that you share with your\nhonorable Pokémon surpasses even mine!
What now? What sweet, glorious pain\nand joy now rock my mighty heart?
I am Malva, and I shall\nbe your opponent today.
You have secured a noble victory over\nMalva of the Elite Four!
That fire within me burns\ntoo hotly to be contained!
Oh goodness. Hello to you!\nWelcome, welcome. Come in.
Oh, dear me. That sure was a quick battle...\nI do hope you’ll come back again sometime!
You and your Pokémon are simply\ntoo charming! I’m so tickled!
Ingrain forever upon your heart and mind\neven that which will fade and disappear!
I shall store my memory of you and your\nPokémon forever away within my heart.
You must devote yourself entirely!\nThat is the fate for any human.
My lens is always focused on victory.\nI won’t let anything ruin this shot!
Ohhh! No one enjoys losing, but you all\nwere such great opponents!
The conclusion of a heated match between two\nTrainers always brings a great photo op!
You’ve come to honor me with a rematch?\nI hope I have what it takes to meet your challenge!
You continue to be a wall that\nI am unable to surmount!
I do believe that the only obstacle left for you to\novercome on your journey is yourself.
Time for Lady Korrina’s big appearance!
It’s your very being that allows\nyour Pokémon to evolve!
I just can’t compare to you! I’ll leave my\nhopes of discovering how Pokémon Mega Evolve\r\nall up to you!
I tell yeh, sprout, the teamwork between me and\nmy Pokémon’s been cultivated over many a year!
A true friendship with Pokémon takes time.\nYeh can’t force it, yeh little whippersnapper!
Yeh did well, sprout.
Behold the power of my new and improved\nPokémon team! They’ve all been powered up by\r\nthe Pokémon-training machine I invented!
Your passion for battle inspires me!
Looks like I need to do a full overhaul of my\nPokémon-training machine to power it up!\c\nAfter that, it’s time to power up my Pokémon\nteam! I suppose I could use some powering\r\nup myself, as well...
The elusive Fairy may appear frail as the breeze\nand delicate as a bloom, but they are strong.
I hope that you will find things\nworth smiling about tomorrow...
Your battling technique and your fashion sense\nare both captivating... Simply captivating...
It’s a ritual--\nchallenging your Pokémon.\r\nThe battle begins!
Create your own path. Let nothing get in your way.\nYour fate, your future.
Memories are life.\nBattles become memories.\r\nProof we are alive.
Let’s get this show on the road!
Outstanding! I’m tough as an iceberg, but\nyou smashed me through and through!
Impressive!\c\nYour Pokémon fought with great courage.\nI can tell that you’ve trained your Pokémon well.
My lens is always focused on victory.\nI won’t let anything ruin this shot!
Ohhh! No one enjoys losing, but you all\nwere such great opponents!
The conclusion of a heated match between two\nTrainers always brings a great photo op!

Let’s get this show on the road!
Outstanding! I’m tough as an iceberg, but\nyou smashed me through and through!
Impressive!\c\nYour Pokémon fought with great courage.\nI can tell that you’ve trained your Pokémon well.
I can’t wait to see what you and your\nPokémon are capable of now that I\r\nknow what you’ve already accomplished!
Witnessing the noble spirits of you and your\nPokémon in battle has really touched my heart...
I think I know now why you’re so strong.\c\nYou and your Pokémon complement\none another perfectly.\c\nTogether, you become more capable\nthan you could ever be when apart.
Hey! What do you think you’re doing?\nYou’ve gotten my sleeves all dirty!
I’ve got better things to do with my time than\nsit about here, battling with random Trainers.
You defeated me completely...\nDoes this mean I’m worthless now?
What? Huh? No way!\nHow could I lose?!
See? I told you all...\nThis one is too strong for us...
Are you for real? Like really?\nI didn’t stand a chance!
Tee hee hee! There are still plenty\nof tricks up my sleeve...
What? It’s over already?!\nNo way! Come on! Let’s go again!
Mmm... How invigorating!
It’s not that I underestimated you, but I certainly\ndidn’t expect this!
Mmm... What magnificent power!\nYou’re the real thing, aren’t you?
This just doesn’t seem right...\nDid I somehow end up with a knockoff?
How painful and distressing it is to lose...\nA lot like life, I suppose.
I can’t stand it! It’s almost as distressing\nas not having money!
You’re something special, aren’t you?\nYes, quite the delight indeed.
Forgive me, darling...\nI am still so weak without you...
I may have an eye for business opportunities, but\nit appears that I’m blind when it comes to battles.
This battle has made me feel my own\ndeficiencies...to a painful degree!
Life is so dull that I find it ever so challenging\nto keep myself entertained every day...
To think that I would have to add such a word\nas “defeat” to my mighty lexicon...
See? I really do know nothing.\nPerhaps I’m not cut out for the battling life...
Huff... Puff...\nToo much... I can’t do it anymore...
Heh heh heh...\nEven if I lose, my dandyism never will!
Mon...sieur...
The pain of this defeat is nothing compared to the\nstruggles I faced daily before finding success!
You’ve got some potential there, kid...\nThe future is bright for you--that’s for sure.
Whoa-ho! I sure did underestimate you!\nYou pack quite a punch, don’t you?
Dressing to look the part means nothing\nif you can’t back it up with true ability!
Hee haw! You beat me good, there!
Losing every once in a while is part of the fun!\nMy life is all about battling, after all...
Well, your skills in battle certainly\nleave nothing to be desired.
EMERGENCY! EMERGENCY!\nABORT MISSION IMMEDIATELY.
Getting defeated so badly like this...\nYou make me feel like rubbish!
If I knew your Pokémon were so strong, I would\nhave challenged YOU to a one-on-one battle!
This isn’t the end for me! I’m going to get stronger\nand make more money! You’ll see...
You’re a g[VAR GENDBR(00FF,0302)]uyirl who knows\nhow to enjoy h[VAR GENDBR(00FF,0202)]iser salad!
Come back again when you’ve honed your palette\nenough to appreciate my fine dishes!
Something about you vaguely reminds\nme of Siebold from the Elite Four...

Amazing! Absolutely amazing! You’ve shown\nme a new world of Pokémon battling!
It’s decided! You are quite simply the best!\nTo put it any other way would not do you justice!

Now this is how you do a Double Battle!
Huff puff...\nHahh hahh...
A perfect Pokémon battle!\nMuch like a perfect blend of magnificent spices!
My well-marinated battling technique did\nnot stand up to your refined palette!
I’m going to be in so much trouble for\nmessing up like this!
Now this is how you do a Triple Battle!

Sushi and Pokémon battles make for\na perfect night in Lumiose, huh?
Oh noes!\nWow, you totally beat me! ♪
Fantabulous! That was praiseworthy indeed!
This cannot be...\nI cannot go on...
You’re somethin’ else!\nEven more somethin’ else than I thought!

Ha ha! You’re too much for me!\nYou’re really something, aren’t you?
I need my stylish red Team Flare suit\nto unleash my full power...
Was I actually a part of Team Flare,\nor was I just a Waitress?
Excellent! I can feel the fire of your convictions\nburning deep within your heart!
Oh ho ho! You’re wonderful!\nYour Pokémon are amazing!
Oooh, you are strong! You and your Pokémon\nare most certainly not ordinary!
Ah ha ha ha! You beat us good.\nWow, we are sooo lame.
Your ability flies in the face of all probability!\nJust what is the source of your power?
You sure are an interesting Trainer. You’re far\nmore capable than our useless Grunts.
Time for me to lay waste to you and your Pokémon\nand finally get recognized by the admins!
No good! No good!\nThe admins are gonna be so mad!
We were told that as long as we created a ruckus,\nwe could advance within Team Flare.\c\nThose Scientists get special treatment, though!\nThey’re real close to Lysandre, after all.
No really, I understand. It’s only natural to\nbe jealous of a suit as stylin’ as mine.
Win or lose, style is all!\nIn a suit like this, I’ve got standards to live up to!
I hate to break it to you, but you’re\nbetter off just giving up!\c\nYou really have to look good in a suit\nto be considered for Team Flare.
We in Team Flare burn with ambition!
Ohhh... You put out my fire...\nI’m nothing but cold ashes now...
Those who live life with a burning passion must\neventually burn out and extinguish, right?
You’d better have come here prepared!\nBoth you and your Pokémon!
Behold the moment of my defeat!\nDon’t even think about blinking!
I lived my life just as I wanted to! I haven’t a\ncare at all for what becomes of the world!
Many say that the world is important--that the world\ndeserves to be saved and cared for.\c\nBut what is “the world” to such people? Surely they\nspeak only of the world they know personally.\c\nThe scope of which is minuscule in comparison\nto the grand scheme of things!
Team Flare cares only about creating a world that\nbenefits Team Flare! At least we’re honest!
Lysandre does whatever he can to help us realize\nour goals. Surely he deserves respect for that!
You’ll be captivated by the warp panel\nand transported away!
I prefer relaxing breathing exercises\nto battles...
The warp panels transport both happiness\nand sadness in equal measure.
I’m gonna send you spinning!
Whatever. I care not if I lose. I’ll be in a brand-\nnew world of beauty and perfection soon!
Stepping on the spin panels will send you\nspinning until you run into something!
Wow, you came all this way?\nI suppose I’d better cheer...\c\nGo, Team Flare! Go, go, Team Flare!\nF to the L to the A to the R to the E!
...Just who was I cheering for?
We were researching the ultimate weapon\nalong with Lysandre and his team of Scientists\r\nin order to bring about world peace!
Looks like...I lost.
Looks like...I lost.
Looks like...I lost.
So...I lost, then.
So...I lost, then.
So...I lost, then.
Why am I still playing catch-up to you?!
Why am I still playing catch-up to you?!

Am I just not good enough to bring out the\nbest in my Pokémon?
Am I just not good enough to bring out the\nbest in my Pokémon?
Am I just not good enough to bring out the\nbest in my Pokémon?
Wha-what?!
When I beat you, tears will fall from your eyes\nlike Poké Balls rolling down a conveyor!
Please, take me away on the conveyor\nto a world without pain!
Even if I lose, more will come--like\nPoké Balls rolling down a conveyor!
I’m a nameless Team Flare Grunt.\nI’ve yet to make a name for myself.
I’m a nameless Grunt who lost.\nI’ve yet to make a name for myself.
I’m a nameless Team Flare Grunt.\nAnd that’s all I’ll ever be...
This is the trademark pose of Team Flare!\nIt’s the very definition of fashionable!
I was up all night practicing this pose!
Ahh... I see! My hand was pointing at\nthe wrong angle. That’s why I lost!
Don’t worry, be happy!
Hard to be happy when you lose...\nWhere did I go wrong?
I can’t help but worry when I lose, though...\nI mean, I’m kind of a scrub, you know?
Ball! Ball! Poké Ball!\nBall! Ball! Ultra Ball!
Ball! Ball! No Ball?! Oh no!\nI don’t have any Balls to throw!
Whatever! If we steal the Poké Balls,\nonly Team Flare will have Pokémon!
Celosia: No way!\nWow, we are lame.
Bryony: Probability is just probability, after all...\nAbsolutes do not exist.
You may have beaten me...again and again.\nBut like I always say, when I lose, I go out in style!
Fashionable people can battle, too!
Fashionable people can be sad, too!
Fashionable people can lose, too!
Hmm... How do you think I could reverse\ntime to the point before I lost?
Not just strong... TOO strong!\nNot ordinary, indeed...
You and your Pokémon have tremendous power!\nKeep on surging into the future!
Battling with you is fun, but losing all the time\ndoesn’t really make me look all that good.
Battling with you is fun, but losing all the time\ndoesn’t really make me look all that good.

Battles with friends are\nreally, really exciting!
Battles with friends are\nreally, really exciting!
Battles with friends are\nreally, really exciting!
It’s weird, but...\nI don’t get that down when I lose to you.
You’re even stronger than I thought!
You are really something!\c\nYou and your Pokémon have developed\nstrong bonds by spending time together\r\nand by caring about one another.\c\nThat’s why you and your Pokémon are so strong.
Oh, hi! Are you here to interview me?
You’re not here from TV then?
I don’t get it! I’m out here every day protecting\nnature and all that, and I don’t get a single\r\ninterview from anyone! What’s up with that?
Whoa!\nDon’t sneak up on me like that!
Haha! I guess you were the one\nwho got surprised here!
I’ve never been great at talking to other people.\nThat’s why I became a Pokémon Ranger.\c\nWhy, you ask? We rangers can spend all day\njust hiding out in nature. That’s why!
SURPRISE!\nI know you didn’t invite me, but here I am!\c\nHahaha! I got you good, didn’t I?
Whoa! You’re strong!\nYOU got ME good!
Hiding in the fallen leaves like this\nmakes me feel like a ninja!\c\nFear the Pokémon Ranger! Or should I say,\n“The Pokémon Ninja”? Hahaha!
If it weren’t for a certain benefactor of mine,\nI wouldn’t be a Pokémon Ranger today.
I’m thankful every single day! For Trainers\nlike you and for my Pokémon!
It was a man called Lysandre who helped me out\nlong ago and kept me on this path.\c\nI wonder how he’s doing these days...
Poké Balls are round!\nThe world is also round!
Win or lose, Poké Balls remain round!
I’m feeling well rounded today!
Uh huh huh huh huh...\c\nDid you hear the voice, too? That’s\nwhy you’re here, right? Uh huh...
Oh, forget this whole Hex Maniac act!
I don’t think I’m cut out for being a Hex Maniac!\nI have no idea how I’m supposed to act...
Want to see the scary side of the Fairy type?\nI’ll show you!
Ohhh... The battle ended before\nI got a chance to show you!
What’s scary about Fairy types?\nIt’s that they’re so cute and pretty!
Eep! Who are you?! Why are you talking to me?!\nIs it a battle you want?! A battle?!
Oh, you! If it’s a battle you want,\nwe won’t refuse!
Rune: Eeeeep!\c\nRime: Hey, that was fun!
Why are you still staring at me?\nI can feel you judging me! Stop it!
That Pokémon battle was a lot of fun!
Eep! How come you only have\none Pokémon with you?
I’m afraid we can’t accept your challenge unless\nyou have more than one Pokémon with you!
Ya can’t make friends with the Pokémon under\nthe water unless ya take up fishing!
There are lots of things that won’t make\nsense until ya try them!
If ya never battle, sure, you’ll never lose...\nBut that would be a pretty boring life,\r\ndon’t ya think?
Just when I thought I lost the biggest catch of my\nlife, you show up! An even bigger catch, I’d say!
I may keep losing the big catches, but I\nwon’t let it get to me! Persistence is key!
Fishing is my life!\nPokémon are my life, too!\c\nI guess that means I have two lives!\nHaha, lucky me! I just like to take it easy.
Whoa-ho! That’s some strong pull on my\nfishing line! Looks like yer a tough bunch!
Hee-yah! That was one rootin’ tootin’ Pokémon\nbattle! Mah Poliwhirl is all tuckered out!
When yer fishing, ya get to meet Pokémon twice!\c\nOnce when they catch the line and once when you\npull ’em up! That’s why I say fishing is the best way\r\nto get to know a Pokémon!
Let us begin our battle! Through it, I will learn\nall there is to know about you! Mwa ha ha!
I learned everything about you, all right!
You’re definitely the leader type!\nLike the protagonist of a game or something!
Guess what! Guess what!\nMy mommy made this dress for me!
I couldn’t be as good as Mommy...
My mommy wears the same type of dress as this!\c\nDaddy always pokes fun at her though!
Allow me to honor you and your\nPokémon with a battle!
Don’t you think Pokémon are just gorgeous\nwhen they’re showing off their moves?
Achlys: What a beautiful combination you\nand your Pokémon make!\c\nEos: I was captivated by your Pokémon’s\nmovement and totally messed up the battle!
I hope you and your Pokémon\ngrow even stronger!
I love Double Battles because it’s exciting to\nthink about what my sister is going to do and\r\ntry to match up with it!
Pokémon are lonely without companions...
Your Pokémon looks a bit lonely\nwithout more Pokémon buddies!
Hmm? Think you got the skills to take me on?
Whoa! Those are some impressive skills!
Heard of the Lost Hotel? Word is that there’s a\nRoller Skater there with some awesome skills!
Drift-and-dash!\nSpin!\r\nThen, boom! Right into battle!
I think I blew it on the barrel roll!
I know I should probably focus on just one, but\nI love Pokémon battles and roller skating equally!
Our Pokémon may be battling high in the sky, but\nwe Trainers must keep our feet on the ground!
Well, this defeat has certainly provided me\nwith some food for thought...
Food for my thoughts is good and all, but I think\nI need some real food for today’s dinner!\c\nThat’s it! I’ll give my cute little Talonflame\nsome delicious Poké Puffs!
Fly, fly, fly up high! Quickly, quickly,\nto our battleground in the sky!
Bwaaah!\nBad memories, fly away!
And now my heart and spirit flies back\nto my hometown of Mistralton City!
I ain’t holdin’ back just ’cuz\nyer a kid, ya little punk!
Ahh, blast it all! What’s the deal?\nKids aren’t supposed to be this strong!
Age don’t matter when it comes to a serious\nPokémon battle!
My buddy was putting on the whole bad-\nguy act, so I copied him and ended up\r\nlike this...
Eeek!\nPlease forgive me!
If only I were as strong as you, I could have pulled\nmy friend out of this dirty world and we could have\r\nbeen Rising Stars together again!
You’re tryin’ to get in the way of my\nhavin’ a little bit of fun, aren’t ya?\r\nI ain’t gonna let that happen!
I was just tryin’ to find peace\nis all! Honest!
I love abandoned buildings like this...\nThere’s a sense of melancholy to them that\r\nI just can’t get enough of!
C’mon, darlin’, bring out your Pokémon!\nMy Seviper and Arbok are itchin’ to play!
Hate to lose, but I gotta admit, you got\nsome strong Pokémon there, kid.
Ever think it’s strange how we’d never have\nmet if it weren’t for us both bein’ Trainers?
Both my mom and my old man are Veterans,\nand my big bro is an Ace Trainer.\c\nI just couldn’t stand to be all goody two-shoes\nlike them! How bo-o-oring can you get?
I don’t care about losing! I just love the\nthrill of a battle!
It’s not like I hate my family or anything...
Rebel against everything! That’s us all right!\nDown with the man, man!
Bad to the bone without a care\nin the world! That’s us all right!
Zoya: Just who are you?\c\nAsa: Dude...you got the power!
I guess it takes power and strength\nto rebel against everything...
Being bad to the bone might not\nbe so good after all...
You got guts tryin’ to take us on with just one\nPokémon, but I ain’t down with those odds.
Get outta here, dummy! Come back when\nyou’ve got more Pokémon with you!
OH NO! I CAN’T FEEL MY TOES!
OH NO! I LOST! I LOST!
I CAN’T STOP SHOUTING!\nI THINK I’LL FREEZE IF I DO!
Both my mother and father were Hikers before me!\c\nIt runs in the family, you see. What makes you\nthink you can take on an elite Hiker like me?
I’ve been defeated. Whatever shall I do?\nMy identity crumbles before me!
You’ve pulled the blinders from my eyes!\nI’m no elite Hiker!\c\nI’ll continue my life as an ordinary Hiker!\nThat’s how it should be!
When it’s cold, it’s best to have\na battle to warm up!
I’m getting a cold sweat from putting on\nsuch a terrible performance!
If it comes to it, I can call out my trusty\nProbopass to warm me up! You see, Probopass\r\ncan use Magnet Pull to provide heat... I think.
Yahoo! I finally meet eyes with someone else\nin this freezing cave!
Always look at your opponent’s eyes!\nEyes often say more than words, you know?
It’s hard to stand the cold gaze of the Black Belt\nfrom across the way. I guess it’s part of my training.
I probably shouldn’t praise my pupil so openly,\nbut her Pokémon have gotten so strong!\r\nI’m very proud!
Hehe! What do you think about me\nfighting instead of a Pokémon?
Really, I can use Karate Chop and Rolling Kick!\nWanna try using me in place of one of your\r\nPokémon partners? Hehe! Just kidding, silly!
What’s this?! Are you trying to thwart my\nattempts at love?! Eat this Karate Chop!
The hurdles to finding love\nare so high...
Ohhh... I can’t get enough of that Battle Girl’s\nwarm and beautiful gaze! I must persevere!
The secret to karate is to have\ngood circular movement!
Round and round we go! Remember,\nit’s all about circular motion!
Circular motion! Yeah... Like kneading dough...\nNo, I’m not talking about my needing money!
Strategy? What strategy? I have trust in our\nGrumpig and Hariyama! That’s all I need!
People say it doesn’t matter if you win or lose,\nbut of course everyone wants to win!
Eoin: It’s over...\c\nWolf: Yep, we’re done...
I may have lost to you all, but I still\nhaven’t lost to myself!\c\nNo, I’m not being a sore loser! Really! No, really!\nOK... Maybe I am...
Now we’re fighting friends!
Two are better than one! The same goes for\nPokémon! Friends are important!
Don’t you think your Pokémon would like a\ntraining partner, too?
Rain or snow, it matters not! An Ace Trainer\ndoes not let anything get in his way!\c\nAn Ace Trainer is always elegant in whatever\nhe does! That’s what it means to be an ace!
Remaining distinguished even in the face of defeat\nis what defines an Ace Trainer!
Even the bitter taste of defeat is only\nencouragement to get stronger to an Ace Trainer!\c\nThat is also what it means to be an ace!
Hey there! You look pretty strong! I’d be\nmissing out if I let you go without a battle!
Ohhh... That was close! Just a little bit more,\nand I would have won!
Ethers are so rare, I can never bring myself\nto use one in battle!
My wings, cut through this snow!\nUp, up, and away!
Your wings are cutting their way through\nthe sky and into the future!
Rest now, my wings. Rest\nnow in your Poké Balls...
Today’s the day I’ve so long been waiting for--\nwhen I start my new life as a Sky Trainer!
Oh no! My first battle has ended in defeat!
I spent over an hour trying to get into\nthis costume, you know?
Brrr... It’s so cold!\nYou there! You came at just the right time!\c\nLet’s warm our bodies with some vigorous\nPokémon battling!
Is this cold I feel coming from the snow and ice\naround me or from the shame of my defeat?
I’ll be OK! I’ve got my Pokémon with me.\nWe can cuddle up to keep each other warm.
Snow-covered paths are full of danger!\nNot only is it freezing cold, but you’ve\r\ngot to be careful where you walk!\c\nThat’s not even mentioning the sudden\nand fierce Pokémon battles you’ll face!
You’re even more full of danger than\nthese snow-covered paths!
If someone who hikes is called a “Hiker” and\nsomeone who climbs is called a “climber,” what\r\ndo you call someone who loves both?\c\nA “hiclimber”?
I saw that look on your face! You’re thinking,\n“Ugh...not another Hiker!” aren’t you?
Argh! Defeated again! Just how many of us\nHikers have to be pulverized in your ascent?
We Hikers are everywhere! No matter the region,\nas long as there’s a place to hike, we’ll be there!\c\nYou may find one right behind you on a dark path...\nHeh heh heh...
Stop right there, youngster! I’m going to\npaint your portrait! Don’t budge an inch!
I told you not to budge an inch...
You kids are all about movies these days,\nbut I still love the beauty of a good painting.
It’s takeoff time!\c\nCome on, everyone, let’s show off\nour air-combat maneuvering!
Alert! Unexpected interception!\nWe’re going down hard and fast!
I just love a good Sky Battle!\nYour piloting skills blew me away!

This Gym exists only by absorbing\nthe power of the cosmos!
Hrmm?! What is the source of your power?!
I only need my Pokémon.\nThey give me all the power I need!
Just because you can’t see it,\ndoesn’t mean it doesn’t exist!
I didn’t cheer hard enough for my Pokémon...\nThat’s right--cheering is a kind of unseen power!
Just because it can’t be explained by science,\ndoesn’t mean it’s not real.\c\nYou can’t explain your love for your Pokémon\nwith science, right?\r\nDoes that mean it’s not real? I think not!
When it comes to climbing, you can ascend or\ndescend. Which do you prefer?
Looks like my battling luck is going downhill!
I tell you, the only reason I climb up a mountain\nis so that I can enjoy going back down!
Aren’t Pokémon moves just the coolest?\nI really wish I could use them...
Pokémon moves are just sooo cool!
I’m a big fan of Brick Break, but what I’d really\nlike to be able to use is Hydro Pump!\r\nI’d spray everyone down!
If I defeat you, I’m going to head\nhome and bake some cookies!
Sigh...
I lost, so no treats for me today!
Woo hoo! I’m a Sky Trainer! Look at me go!\nWooooo!
Woo hoo! I lost! Look at me lose!\nWooooo!
When I’m high up like this, I just get so excited!
With my shorts on, there’s no stopping me!\nI can go anywhere!
Scolipede! Pinsir!
Shorts or not, a Trainer can’t go anywhere\nif his Pokémon are feeling down...
Oh no! Oh no!\nI’m late! I’m late!\c\nOh no! Oh no!\nWatch out! Watch out!
Hmm? Huh? What?\nWhere am I, anyway?
How strange...\c\nI was on my way to the Trainers’ School,\nand somehow I ended up here...
I feel kind of embarrassed in a swimsuit, so I like\nto swim in murky water like this to stay out of sight.
Ohhh... The murky water couldn’t\nhide my battling weakness!
This battle helped me see the light!\nI’ve got nothing to hide!\c\nI’m going to head over to Azure Bay\nand catch some waves!
I protect nature in order to protect Pokémon...\c\nWhat about people, you ask?\nNever mind that! Let’s battle!
The term “Pokémon Trainer” has to do with\nboth people and Pokémon...
People and Pokémon can coexist, but should there\nnot also be places that are just for Pokémon?
It’s a Pokémon Ranger’s duty to ensure that\nPokémon can live the same way tomorrow as\r\nthey do today.
I know there’s always going to be a tomorrow,\nso I don’t let defeat get to me very much.
Whether I win or lose, I live every day to its fullest.\nThat’s what I learned from my Pokémon.
Have you ever heard of parkour?
Parkour doesn’t really have anything\nto do with Pokémon battles...
Parkour is sometimes called “free running.”\nYou run, jump, climb, and crawl to move over\r\nobstacles and strengthen your body!\c\nIt’s very useful when chasing after Pokémon!
“Time for a Pokémon battle.”\n...Is what the me from 10 seconds ago said.
I could see myself being defeated by you...
Did you really battle and defeat me?\c\nAm I the same person as the person you just\ndefeated moments ago? I can’t prove that...
Hee hee hee hee...\c\nFall before my fairies!
Mwa ha ha ha! I can see the fairies!\c\nThey’re waving at me from across the river!
Tee hee hee hee! I can hear them!\c\nThe fairies are whispering to me... “Fight!” “Win!”\nThat’s what they say! Hee hee hee...
We are Pokémon Rangers! We bring\nout the power in our Pokémon!
We are Pokémon Rangers! We draw\nout the power in our Pokémon!
Ivy: We drew out all the power we could!\c\nOrrick: But you proved to be even more powerful!
If you want to draw on your partners’ powers,\nyou need to know their strong points!
It’s better to focus on your own strong points\nrather than to try matching up with your partners’!
It’s important for Trainers to share their\nlove with many Pokémon!
I want to battle against the best Pokémon team\nyou have! You need more than just one!
Flying high in the sky can show\nyou a whole new world!
How far can you see?
I wonder if Pokémon that fly and Pokémon\nthat can’t see the world differently...

I feel like I’m missing something before I can\ntake on Victory Road...\r\nLet me battle you and find out what that is!
Thanks for defeating me! Now I know\nwhere I need to improve!
Some people think that losing is a bad thing.\c\nIf you ask me, those people are ignoring\nopportunities to learn and improve!
I’ve been with my Pokémon partners since\nthe very beginning of my journey!
My partners have been at my side\nfor every defeat...
I know that someday fate will part us...\c\nThat’s why I take every battle we have\ntogether seriously!
Among Trainers, words are unnecessary,\nwouldn’t you say?\c\nHippowdon, Aurorus, it’s battle time!\nShow them your strength!
You really showed me your strength of\nbody and spirit! Impressive!
I love strong Pokémon!\c\nI know I have it in me to train any Pokémon\ninto a strong Pokémon!
I’ve lost track of how long I’ve been waiting\nhere for my sweetheart to return...\c\nI was once an innocent Lass, but now I’m\nall grown up.
Deep down inside, I know that he\nwill never come back to me...
It’s been hard to wait here for so long, but my\nPokémon have been here with me through it all.
A strong Pokémon and a strong Trainer come\ntogether to form a strong team! It’s that simple.
Once you’ve memorized all the Pokémon moves\nand Abilities, victory just comes naturally!
Elina: Abracadabra!\c\nSean: Hocus Pocus!
Fool! All it takes to form a stronger team is to\nbecome a stronger Trainer and have your\r\nPokémon become stronger, too!
After memorizing all the Pokémon moves and\nAbilities and the items that are out there,\r\nit’s easy to come up with a good\r\nstrategy for victory!
Are you telling me you are unable to raise\nmore than just one Pokémon?
You only have one Pokémon that’s fit to fight?\nThat’s not gonna cut it!
Blue sky!\nBlue ocean!
Feeling blue...
When it comes to being a Sky Trainer, I’m\nas green as this grass I’m standing on.
Tierno: Whoa... Now THAT\nwas a nice move!
Trevor: So you can’t learn everything just\nfrom the Pokédex...I see!
Admin: You fools...\nYou don’t even have suits!
I see... Even a weak-looking Rattata can be a\nthreat when it uses a move like Hyper Fang!
Admin: Lysandre is like the sun to us!\nHe represents our hope!
You might be strong, but your teamwork\nis still a bit lacking!
Who’s got that flair? Team Flare!\nYeah, we’ve got that flair! Team Flare!
Admin: Yes, I lost. But no matter.\nLysandre is the one who will take care of things.
If you guys think we’ll let you\njoin Team Flare after all this,\r\nyou’ve got another think coming!
You’re just trying to benefit from\nour success, aren’t you?!
Lysandre is only going to save Team Flare,\nbecause we’re the only ones who are\r\ntruly worried about the future.
Taking all of the money and stuff for ourselves\nwill make a world where Team Flare is happy!
Are you trying to stop Team Flare from obtaining\nhappiness? What a vile person you are!
Not having a ton of money\nis really stressful, you know...
The ultimate weapon is stealing\nthe Legendary Pokémon’s power.
Taking all of the Legendary Pokémon’s life force\nis an unfortunate necessity to realize our goals.
There’s no way everybody can be happy!\nEach of us has different dreams.
Do you actually think all living\nthings can be truly happy?
You don’t even try to understand Lysandre\nand all that he suffers for!
One person’s pleasure is another\nperson’s pain, right?
I swam all the way here from the oceans of\nHoenn, and I’m still not too tired for a battle!
Maybe I overestimated how much strength\nI had left in me!
The ocean’s amazing!\c\nYou can get from anywhere to anywhere else\nas long as they’re connected by water!
Wanna see some cool water illusions?\nI’m a pro when it comes to water!
Those are some beautiful moves\nyour Pokémon have!
Where does the water that Slowpoke sprays\ncome from? Is it its tears? Its sweat?
I’ll think about what you did well\nand use this loss to make me better!
I’ll think about what you did well\nand use this loss to make me better!
I’ll think about what you did well\nand use this loss to make me better!
I’ll think about what you did well and use\nthis loss to fuel my desire to improve.

Man... You defeated my Pokémon bad...\nWhy’s it gotta be like that?
[~ 1144]
[~ 1145]
Ahh, man! There goes all my money...
[~ 1147]
[~ 1148]
Ugh... Argh... Gah...
[~ 1150]
[~ 1151]
How’d I go and lose the match like that?\nNothing’s goin’ right for me today!
[~ 1153]
[~ 1154]
Ha ha ha! You’re a strong one, aren’t ya?\nI like Trainers who aren’t afraid to win!
[~ 1156]
[~ 1157]
Ain’t you a strong one?\nToo strong for me!
[~ 1159]
[~ 1160]
You nearly scrapped my Pokémon!
[~ 1162]
[~ 1163]
I feel like I just got ran over...\nTime to back things up a bit!
[~ 1165]
[~ 1166]
Gone with the wind...\nThat’s me after this battle!
[~ 1168]
[~ 1169]
I often get some rowdy passengers,\nso I’ve always got to be prepared!
[~ 1171]
[~ 1172]
I can’t see so well through these tears...\nI’d better not drive like this.
[~ 1174]
Wow!\nYou’re a weally strong Trainer!
Wahhh!
I can’t do it...\nI just can’t win...
I knew this battle would end up like this...
This is weak! For true...\nVery, very weak!
Whaddaya think yer doin’ to my\ndarling Pokémon, punk?
Tsk... Man, forget this nonsense...
How wonderfully strong!
Tee hee hee hee...
Mmm... Wonderful...\nI want that Poké Ball...
I see...
Hmph!
Where in the world did you come from?!\nYou’re suspect! Very suspect!
This strength...\nIt’s suspect!
Only staff chosen by Doctor Xerosic were\nsupposed to be able to enter this floor!\c\nYou are suspect...\nSo very suspect...
Hmm? Who might you be?\nAre you the new hire?
Everything is within expectations!\nNothing is wrong with my calculations!
Starting with that foolish girl, I just can’t\nunderstand why Dr. Xerosic would let\r\nin so many feeble-minded hooligans...\c\nI suppose I just can’t understand his genius!
Hmm? Who goes there? Who are you?\nWhat business do you have here?
What amazing Pokémon you have there!\nYou must allow me to analyze them in the lab...
Are you another one of the new security\nguards hired on by the doctor?\c\nThe guys that came before you--especially\nthe ones from the gang--are a bunch of slackers!
... ... ...
... ... ...
... ... ...
Uwaaaaaauuuuuuggghhh!!!
Hmm...\nI lost...
I’m workin’ ’ere, so buzz off!
That was bangin’!\nI ain’t got no beef with yer!
Sorry for tryin’ to give yeh air like that!\c\nYer’ve gotta remember me, don’tcha?\nI’m the lovely one in the Lumiose Gang!\c\nEmma got us this sweet gig running\nsecurity here for the doc, see?
Hoi! Are yer trying to sneak in or summat?\nBut wait... I know that mug o’ yers!
Right on. I knew I’d seen yer mug before!\nYou put me to rights in the station last time!
All right there. How’s it goin’?\c\nYeh’ve gotta remember me, innit? I’m the one\nwho brings charm to the Lumiose Gang!\c\nWhatcha up to, anyway?\nIf you keep on wanderin’ about,\r\nsomeone’ll figure you for an intruder!
Ugh...\nYer seriously strong...
I know, I know!\nIt’s a battle you want!
This was a fitting battle for the wide-open sky!
Keep aiming for the top and giving it your all!\nI’ll be following in your wake!
There’s no way you could walk on water!
...!\nWait! I’ve got it!
If I could get a Pokémon to continuously blast\nHydro Pump under my feet, I could totally walk\r\non water... I might even be able to walk the sky!
Now that I’m all grown and finally able to swim,\nthere’s nothing out there to frighten me!
Actually, you kind of frighten me...
You may have won, but I’m staying in the water!\nI’m going to swim forever and ever!
The strength to protect, huh?\c\nBut what are you really protecting? A tomorrow\nthat will only end up being worse than today?
It’s over...\c\nFools with no vision will continue to befoul this\nbeautiful world.\c\nThey will go on until the only thing left to do is\nsquabble over the remaining scraps of hope...
Yes! That’s right!\nI’m the Red Pokémon Ranger!
Oh no!\nThe Red Pokémon Ranger is in trouble!
You’re pretty good, you know?\c\nYou wanna join my Pokémon Ranger team?\nYou could be the Blue Ranger!
Don’t you underestimate us!\c\nWe’re about as a strong as\nAce Trainers, you know?
How could I lose to you?! You’re not even an\nAce Trainer. Just an ordinary Trainer!
In terms of actual practicality, wouldn’t you say that\nwe Pokémon Rangers are actually superior to\r\nAce Trainers?
I just want to spend time with my Pokémon, but\neveryone keeps challenging me to battles...\c\nI ran all the way here, and yet I still can’t\nfind any peace and quiet!
I can see that you and your Pokémon\ntrust each other very much!
I think I get it... You just want to spend\nquality time with your Pokémon, too...\r\nI guess there are different ways to do that...
Hmmm?\nYou look like you’d be a good opponent for my\r\nSteelix to gain some good experience.
Hmmmmmm?! Your Pokémon are the ones\nthat got experience from this match?
Hmmm... I guess I may have overestimated\nmy abilities a little bit.\c\nGetting to Victory Road isn’t even the final goal\nof my career as a Pokémon Trainer!
I’ve been running around in my bare feet to train!\nDo you have any idea how strong that’s made me?
Ouch! You mean running around in my bare feet\ndidn’t help me improve at Pokémon battling?
Y’know... It’s kind of painful to be running around\nin my bare feet in here... My toes get cold!\c\nMy Pokémon are always in their bare feet...\nI wonder if they don’t mind it.
Moves are a result of a Pokémon’s strength!
Impressive! Keep up the good work.\nRepetition is strength!
When two Pokémon use the same move,\nthe stronger one will win!
Now that you’re on Victory Road, I bet you’re\nnervous and excited! Let’s see!
Looks like you’re a bit nervous,\nbut relaxed enough to focus!
Relax! Relax!\c\nAll you’ve got to do is put your trust in the\nPokémon that helped you get here.
Hi-yah!\nYou’ve got some nerve to challenge me!
Hi-ya-- Huh...\nYou beat me...
Hi-yah!\nYou’ve got some impressive skills, there!
All it takes to go on a journey is a pinch\nof curiosity! Really, that’s it!
The weight of this backpack really\ndigs into my shoulders...
Traveling alone is fine and dandy, but\ntraveling with friends really can’t be beat!
You don’t need to say a word! I can tell\nthat you’re here because you want to\r\nchallenge a strong opponent!
I felt your strength with all of my being!
The strong opponents you so desire\nare up ahead...
I can see your aura...\nIt’s got an unlucky color about it...
Unlucky for me, I see...
I can see your aura...\c\nIt’s got a warm, kind-looking color... It just looks\nunlucky to anyone who would be your opponent!
Whatchoo lookin’ at?!\c\nYou think I’m just doin’ this Fairy Tale Girl thing\nfor funsies, do ya?! Get a taste of my power!
Whoaaa!\nYou... You’re good!
I’ve been working at this Fairy Tale Girl thing for\na while, but I was still kind of embarrassed...\c\nBut this battle has given me some confidence!\nNow can I be a Fairy Tale Girl with pride!
Vet-- Vet-- Veteran! Vet-- Vet-- Veteran!\nVeteran all the WAY!\c\nSo, what do you think of my theme song?\nNow it’s time for battle!
I guess my theme song didn’t help out my\nbattling skills at all...
The secret to staying young is to spend\ntime having fun with your Pokémon!\c\nEvery day is so packed with excitement\nthat you don’t have time to get old!
After all the training I’ve received here on\nVictory Road, my body is ready!\r\nThink you can defeat me?!
Even with my honed and toned body\nof muscle and brawn, I couldn’t win!
Why?! My furious fists can pulverize even\nboulders of granite! How could I lose?!\c\nOh? Is it because I spent so much time training\nmyself and not training my Pokémon?
If Pokémon can so easily fly and swim,\nwhat use do they have for us Trainers?
Surely Pokémon don’t stick by our sides\nsimply to have battles like this...
If Pokémon can so easily fly and swim,\nwhat use do they have for us Trainers?\c\nIt’s something that all of us should be\nthinking about.
You’ve got youth on your side, but we’ve got\nyears of experience on ours!\r\nThis will be a battle of youth against wisdom!
I can see that youth isn’t all you have! You must’ve\ngained a lot of experience on your journey, too.
Veterans like myself are always happy to see\ntough and energetic youths like yourself!\r\nIt gives us inspiration to train even harder!
To cap off your string of battles, I want\nyou to come at me with all your might!
I lost with all my might!
You’re even more powerful than I imagined!\nHow about you line up in here with us?\c\nNo, you’ve got better things to do!\nGo on ahead with all your might!
I started out just wanting the strength to protect\nthose that I love, but now...\c\nNow all I want is to keep battling for the thrill of it!\nDid I lose my way? Is what I’m doing correct?
You and your Pokémon just showed me\nwhat battles are supposed to be about!
I knew it deep down--that a goal and the means\nto reach that goal are not the same.\c\nIt’s important to never lose sight of what you’re\nfighting for.
So, I’ve got to steady my right arm at this angle...\nMy left hand goes on my hip...\c\nNext, I just bend my knees down ever so slightly...\nThen stick out my chest like this...\c\nOh! I’m sorry! I didn’t notice you there!\nA battle, is it? OK, let’s get started.
What strength! Just what kind of ranger are you?!
I was just working on my victory pose...\nIt’s an important part of being a Pokémon Ranger!\c\nI think I’m going to have to stick out my chest a\nbit more and then pose my right hand like so...
In order to meet strong Trainers and strong\nPokémon, one only has to battle!
Battles are kind of like the representation of a\nTrainer’s love for her Pokémon!
In order to meet great Trainers and great\nPokémon, one has to be proactive!
To compare this to mountain climbing,\nI’d say I’m almost at the summit!
To be so close to the summit and be\ndefeated... How disappointing!
To be unprepared is to be inviting danger! That\ngoes for mountain climbing and Pokémon battles.
If battling strategies could be described using\ncolors, I wonder what color yours would be...
The color of passionate moves is red...\nThe color of cool decisions is blue...
Your battle strategy comes in all the colors of\nthe rainbow! That’s how strong you are!
I’m going to teach you a lesson!
People call us strange for being more\ninterested in perfecting our teamwork\r\nthan challenging the Champion...
Arman: Man...this is boring!\c\nHugo: You can really see the frustration\nof defeat on my partner’s face...
Even if you forget about us, we’ll\nstill keep on living!
It’s depressing to lose, that’s for sure. But\nfeeling blue every once in a while isn’t so bad.
You think you can get through Victory Road\nwith just one Pokémon? You crazy?!
Friends give you courage! Come back when\nyou have more Pokémon with you.
Haha! It sure does feel good to let loose every\nonce in a while!\c\nSpying on people’s Holo Caster conversations\ngets boring pretty quickly, after all!
Nice! My Pokémon like to let loose every\nonce in a while, too!
Right here, right now! I just live in the moment!\nForget worrying about tomorrow!
Just because you don’t understand your opponent,\ndoesn’t necessarily make them bad or wrong!
I feel like I understood something\nabout you, though...
You’ll understand just how warm and kind Lysandre\nreally is when he puts his grand plan into action!
Welcome, intruder!\c\nYou’re in the wrong for coming here, so I won’t\nhear any complaints from you about being beaten\r\nto a pulp by us!
No! It’s my Pokémon that got beaten!
You can try all you like, but it’s futile...\nOnly Team Flare will survive in the end.
[~ 1301]

Time to show off our Pokémon!
You got us! Your Pokémon are just\nabout as cute as ours!
Every Trainer’s favorite Pokémon\nis his own Pokémon!
Time to show off our Pokémon!
I can’t stop tee-heeing, because the sight of\nyour Pokémon really tickles me! Tee hee!
Even if we lost, my Pokémon did their best!\nTime to reward them with some Poké Puffs!
My dark magic along with my\nPokémon cannot be defeated!
My dark magic didn’t work?\nYou and your Pokémon are shining too brightly!
My dark magic will make you even stronger...
Tee hee hee. ♪ You just ran into a girl who’s\nhead over heels for Pokémon battles.
Girls in love don’t mind if they lose. ♪
Tee hee hee. ♪ Such a mysterious power!\c\nPokémon have such an amazing strength!\nThey bring smiles to everyone’s faces!
We’re gonna be the toughest Twins in the world!
We’re gonna be the toughest Twins in the world!
Nana: Ohhh...we lost!\c\nNina: It’s OK! We’re still gonna be the\ntoughest Twins in the whole world!
You gotta know when to use Protect\nin a Double Battle!
You gotta know how to get around Protect\nwhen it’s used against you!
We’re Twins, silly! You need two\nPokémon to challenge us!
I wanna see lots and lots of Pokémon!\nYou only have one!
That was some nice footwork!
I guess I need to spend more time\non the prep work...
This battle has put me in a delightful mood!
Even a simple Pokémon battle like\nthis feels so dramatic!
What incredible Pokémon you have...\nYou’re something special, aren’t you?
Oh man!\nOh man! Oh man!
Sigh...
Is it your honor as a warrior that you don’t\ndeal the finishing blow?
Oh... I must have been captivated by\nthe beauty of this city!
Mmm! How stylish!
I need something more exciting\nthan this to forget about him!
As long as I’m with my Pokémon, I get to meet\nall sorts of people from around the world\r\nand trade and battle with them!
It’s all thanks to my Bidoof that I got to meet you!\nThat’s got to be good for something!
Being with Pokémon helps broaden your world!
I’m still no match for you...\c\nYou know, it’s because I met you that\nI was able to get this far...\c\nBut our journey’s just getting started.\nWho knows what heights we’ll reach!
I’m still no match for you...\c\nYou know, it’s because I met you that\nI was able to get this far...\c\nBut our journey’s just getting started.\nWho knows what heights we’ll reach!

So, I still can’t beat you...\c\nYou know, it’s because I met you that\nI was able to get this far...\c\nWell, our journey’s not over yet!\nWho knows how strong we’ll get.
So, I still can’t beat you...\c\nYou know, it’s because I met you that\nI was able to get this far...\c\nWell, our journey’s not over yet!\nWho knows how strong we’ll get.
Grunt: You might be strong, but your teamwork\nis still a bit lacking!
Grunt: I may have lost, but it doesn’t matter!\nLysandre will take care of everything.
Grunt: Phlogiston...\nExtinguished...
Oh? We’re done already, pet?\nI could’ve gone on for days, I could!
O-oh... Um...\nG-good work out there... Right?
Hmph... So you held your own.\nI’ll admit that you’re not terrible, at least.
Heheheh! That was great craic!\nWhat do you say? Did you have fun, too?
Wh-what?! Not even my ultra-powerful\nLucario duo could stand up to you?!
And I was so excited, too...

Have we met or not? I don’t really remember.\nWell, I guess it’s nice to meet you anyway!
Yahoo! YAHOO!\nI did it! I won again!
No way... NO WAY!\nHow could I lose again...
All right! Here I come!\nI’ll show you my power!
You amazed? You surprised?\nBy the power of my Pokémon?!
Whoa! You are incredible!\nI’m amazed and surprised!
B-b-bonjour, Dresseur!\nB-battle, s’il vous plaît!
Merci bien!
Aw, sh-shucks!
Don’t let your guard down, or you\nmay be crying when a kid beats you.
I may be young, but that doesn’t\nmean I’ll lose--even to a grown-up.
Sheesh! Can’t you see that I’m just a kid!\nIt wasn’t fair of you to go all out like that!
Let’s have a fun Pokémon battle!
Hehe! Mehehehehe!\nSee? It’s fun to win!
That was pretty amazingly fun!\nYou’ve totally exhausted me...
A serious battle starts from a serious\nbeginning! Are you sure you’re ready?
Seriously, winning a serious\nbattle is seriously the best!
Seriously, I lost. That is, like, seriously\ndepressing, but you were seriously cool.
You’d better go easy on me, OK?\nThough I’ll be seriously fighting!
I can’t believe I won! Wait...\nDid you seriously go easy on me?
Hey! I told you to go easy on me!\nStill, you’re pretty cool when you’re serious.
Um, um, um, you know what?\nThese Pokémon are my friends.
I...I’m sorry. I just wanted\nto show you my friends...
Just being with my Pokémon\nmakes me happy, so it’s OK!
...Heehee. I’m confident in\nmy calculations and analysis.
Heheh. Exactly as I planned...\nThere’s no way I would lose.
Ohhhh... Calculation and analysis\nare perhaps no match for chance...
We’re about to battle, but that doesn’t\nmean we can’t be polite! Good luck!
That could have gone better,\nbut I do thank you very much.
I feel like crying in frustration,\nbut I do thank you very much.
I’ve been studying every single day,\nso I’m taking a break for a change.
You see, playing with Pokémon\nis fun. I want to study Pokémon.
Ah, my Pokémon lost...\nMaybe I’ll stick to studying.
I want to be a Pokémon\nresearcher when I grow up.
Do you think Pokémon research\nprojects need any test subjects?
I must do my best to learn\neven more about Pokémon.
Ah... You look strong...\nI hope I’ll be all right...
Oops, you weren’t as strong as I\nexpected. Looks can be deceiving.
I could tell you are a strong Trainer!\nWhat you see is what you get, right?
I always get the best grades!\nI aim to be number one in everything!
I will keep winning and winning\nand winning... I will be number one!
If I lose at such an early\nstage, I can’t be number one...
Wha--? You wanna battle with me?\nI suppose we could arrange something...
Ah, I shoulda known.\nHey, don’t blame me.
Oh, wh-whoa. I’m no match for you.\nYour Pokémon are somethin’ else.
Grumble, grumble...
Grumble, grumble...\nHuh? Did I win?
Grumble, grumble...\nOh? Was that it?
Here I am, a master of the universe,\na mover and shaker of the future!
The class differences always tell.\nI’m worried about your future, kid.
I really let myself get carried away this time.\nI hope it doesn’t affect my future prospects.
Are you my opponent?\nYou look kind of hungry.
Hmm. Have you been eating well?\nCan’t fight on an empty stomach!
Are you sure you’re normal?\nWhat in the world do you eat?
I am a nouveau riche celebrity,\nso I am stingy with my money!
Unfortunately, you’ve lost to me.\nNow, give me your lunch money!
I lost, but I won’t give\nyou my lunch money!
My mom chose my Pokémon.\nI don’t think they’ll lose to you.
You see that? I’ll be fine as\nlong as I listen to my mom.
Mommy! Mama-a-a! Waaah!\nMake the mean Trainer go away!
Ahhh, a Trainer who looks gorgeous!\nI hope your battle is just as beautiful.
Such a looker lost to me?!\nI’m a little disappointed.
Oh my, our battle was just as\ngorgeous. I feel drawn to you.
What kind of Pokémon do you\nlike? Hey, come on, show me!
Your taste in Pokémon is wonderful, but\nyou are a disappointment as a Trainer.
Your taste in Pokémon is truly awful,\nbut you are a first-class Trainer!
I’m sorry--I’ve been lying.\nI’m not really a rich girl.
Everybody paid more attention to\nme when I pretended to be rich.
The truth is that I’m nothing more\nthan the daughter of a Clerk ♂.
Ahahaha!
Ahahaha!!!
Ahaha-argh...
Preschooler gonna battle you!\nOh yeah! Nice to meet you.
Little baby is a winna!\nTank you! Tank you!
Da Preschooler lost!\nTank you anyways!
I am a genius Preschooler!\nI’m already prepping for college.
You lost to a Preschooler...\nAnd how old are you again?
I’m confident in studying, but I’m\njust a beginner in Pokémon battles.
I am the hero!\nI refuse to lose!
I AM the hero!\nI beat a villain!
A hero never loses.\nA hero never dies.
I am very strong.\nI will never lose.
Daddy gave me my Pokémon!\nThey’ve gotta be the strongest!
WAAAH!
No pouting when you lose,\n’cause that’s just lame.
I’m so happy, I could c-cry!\nYip-yip-yippeee!
Awww, s-sniff! I losted on my battle...\nIt’s sad, but I s’pose it’s my fault.
Are you gonna pick on me?
You didn’t pick on me.\nSo I guess I like you!
You did pick on me, after all, but\nI like you ’cause you’re strong!
Game on, Pokémon!\nGive it all you’ve got!
Mmmm-hahaha! Yahoo! Yahoo!\nThank you very much, Pokémon!
Booooo! Come on,\nPokémon! Try harder!
I am four years old! I will do my best!\nTrainer, you should do your best, too!
I’m four years old! I did my best!\nTrainer, you were really weak.
I’m four years old! I did my best!\nTrainer, you did your best, too!
Lalalala... Lalalala...\nI am a loner...
Lalalala... Lalalala...\nDrifting like clouds...
Lalalala... Lalalala...\nTill we meet again...
I am not just an ordinary Backpacker,\n’cause I’m also a newlywed, you see!
My new wife and I are hitchhiking for our\nhoneymoon, ’cause we have no money.
This is my honeymoon! B-but...\nBut I’ve lost my wife somewhere...
Hitchhiking around the region without\na cent to your name has its own charm.
See? Travel is best when\nyou’re young and poor.
Argh... I’m so hungry...\nCan you please spare something...
It’s no holds barred on this\njourney! Where’s my adventure?!
My journey... No, my adventure of\na lifetime hasn’t even begun yet!
The journey isn’t over. Just you wait!\nI’ll show you the greatest adventure ever!
The truth is that I’m a time traveler.\nI just popped by from the future.
Even if I lose, I can just jump in my time machine\nand go back to the past to try a battle again!
Yes, traveling through time...\nThat’s how I go!
You know, the prices in this region are\nreally quite something, aren’t they!
Though the level of the Trainers in this region...\nWell, they’re nothing worth writing home about.
I couldn’t possibly live in a country\nwhere everything costs so much!
Sometimes I need a little time to rest.\nI’m gonna take it easy this battle, OK?
That was a nice and easy win.\nI’ll work hard again tomorrow!
That was supposed to be refreshing,\nbut now I feel more stressed out.
All I want is to work hard, save\nmy money, and live a quiet life.
Everybody has a different dream.\nI just want to have a normal life.
I’d rather simply have security and\nhappiness than chase a big dream.
Hey! Welcome! I’ve got some real\nplump and lively Pokémon right here!
What do you think of my Pokémon?\nThey’re fresh!
Thanks for coming! What’d you think?\nDid my Pokémon suit your tastes?
Didn’t you come here for a Pokémon battle?
Don’t be scared, or you will never win.
You are a strong Trainer.\nForgive my impertinence.
Hiya, honey! Welcome, welcome!\nHave you decided what you’ll have?
Order up! One humiliation in\na Pokémon battle, over easy.
Order up! One glorious victory in\na Pokémon battle, sunny-side up.
Meow, meow, I can haz battle, meow?\n(Ugh, I really sound like a fool, don’t I?)
Yeah! Meow! I haz victory, meow!\n(I seriously want to quit this job.)
Meowww... I haz lost, meowww.\n(This job is sooo embarrassing.)
My love for Pokémon is stronger than\nanybody else’s. Love can do anything.
This victory proves my\ntrue love for Pokémon.
Love should conquer all. Love\nshould’ve helped me win...right?
Oh, do you want to see the\nPokémon I am proudest of?
What do you think about my\ndear Pokémon? Great, right?
Oh my goodness! My poor Pokémon...
Here I go! I battle for the\nhonor of the branch office!
I am a branch manager of the\nPokémon Fan Club--and I won!
Urk! F-farewell for now!\nI’ll remember this, child!
I lost a lot of things because\nI love Pokémon too much...
I have devoted my life to Pokémon.\nI see things differently than you do.
I cannot win even with my\ndevotion. What shall I do?!
Listen, I love Pokémon more\nthan life itself!
I’ll be a Pokémon in my next life.
I love your Pokémon, too!\nPlease, let me pet them!
I’m not good at battling, but this\nis one of the duties of a Poké Fan.
I’ve kept the honor of the\nPoké Fan alive. Hahaha!
Cheers, all you Poké Fans out there!\nMay the Poké Fan last forever!
My middle-age spread has given me as\nmuch gravitas as the mountains I hike!
Bwahaha! You’ll win, too, if you\njust up your calorie intake a bit!
At least I cannot lose\nwhen it comes to BMI!
I am no mere Hiker.\nCall me an alpinist.
A mountain maniac like me\nis properly called an alpinist.
A specialist in mountainous\nmatters. That’s an alpinist.
I’m bursting with dreams and desires!\nI’m just a bundle of youthful vigor!
Dreams are important!\nDesires are important!
I’m so full of dreams and desires that I’m about\nto burst! But that’s what it means to be young!
Is it really OK? Do you really think\nsomeone like me can be a Trainer?
No way... I’m actually pretty good!\nOr are you just a total amateur?
Ahhh... I knew I’d be terrible at it...\nI can’t call myself a Trainer like this...
Anyone can stay young if they keep stars\nin their eyes and dreams in their hearts!
I won’t tell you how old I really am, but I\ncan say I’m old enough to be your mother!
All you have to do is ignore reality,\nand you can stay young forever, too.
If it’s cute, fluffy Pokémon\nyou want, leave it to me!
A harmony of strength and cuteness...\nThat’s what I’m all about!
A fragile ephemerality...\nYes, that’s another of my charms...
My dear cuties whisper all kinds of secrets to me...
You see?\nMy cuties teach me all kinds of good things.
Why don’t my cuties say anything?\nWhy do they seem in such a bad temper?
I won’t be going easy on you just\nbecause you’re a kid. Bring it on!
Heh. You can’t do battle\nif you’re afraid of losing.
Harrumph. I’m still weak.\nI pity my Pokémon...
I may be bad and stupid, but\nI’m serious about Pokémon.
I only really feel at peace\nwhen I’m with Pokémon.
I hope you’ll find something\nyou can be serious about.
My amazing punk hair is\nthe secret to my power.
The more I spike my hair,\nthe stronger I am!
If you want to be even stronger, you\nshould get amazing punk hair, too!
What d’you think you’re lookin’ at?!\nYou’ve got some kind of nerve, kid!
A hard chick like me doesn’t need anybody else\nto fight! My Pokémon are all the backup I need!
Amazin’! I got schooled from here to Hoenn!\nYou gotta take me under your wing, boss!
I’m Callisto, the boss of the Kalos Coalition.\nIt’d be my pleasure to take you on in battle!
Phew... You’ve got some good\nPokémon on your side, all right.
Well, ain’t you something... All right, then.\nI’m stepping down--you’re the new boss!
The guy I like is, like, totally bad...\nI’m gonna be real bad for that cad...
The gals of the Kalos region, like yeah...\nOoh, ooh, ooh, we battle, ooh yeah...
Gals of Kalos don’t take it on the chin...\nOoh, ooh, ooh, you’ll regret this win...
Non, non! A dash of defeat is not called\nfor in my recipe book! C’est pas possible!
Ouais! Where is the life? Where is the vigor?\nIt would not even tempt a half-starved Skitty!
Bon sang! What spice! What kick you have!\nYou must tell me your secret ingredient!
S-so you’ve come to challenge me!\nGet too close, and I will sauté you!
It...it...it’s all your fault for challenging me!\nNext time I’ll turn you into a tasty concasse!
Stop! Just hold on a moment!\nI don’t want to be flambéed!
In the land of feasting, I am king!\nNay, I am the Emperor of Eating!
Ahhh, the Emperor of Eating is satiated!\nI polished off your Pokémon in no time!
I-I give up my seat as Emperor of Eating...\nTake care of my precious land of feasting...
Wanna give me a hand with my training?\nIt’s all for the sake of my future dreams!
Your defeat is another small step\ntoward my dreams coming true!
What! B-b-but my future... Have you seriously\nconsidered what defeat will do to my future?!
Talent? Hah! It’s just a convenient excuse\nlazy Trainers use to explain away their losses.
Talent is not something that can be gained,\nand strength grows weak if it is not used.
So-called talent is no more than an illusion...\nThe efforts of one’s own are all that is real.
In the words of an ancient warrior, “Conquer\nthe self, and you will conquer the opponent.”
What do you wish to do now? Shall I\nleave and relieve you of your shame?
Ahhhh! What a crock! If I can’t even conquer\nyou, then who cares about conquering myself?!
I’m gonna give it my all. It’s only natural!\nYou can only get results by doing battle!
How does it feel to lose?\nObviously, I wouldn’t know.
Whether you give it your all or slack off...\nAll that matters in the end is who wins...
Hmph! I’m no servant of yours!
No one but my master\nwill ever make me bow!
U-ugh... Rather strong, aren’t you?\nI suppose I might not mind serving you...
Are your preparations complete?\nI would like to ask you for a battle.
A strength equal to that of my master...\nI look forward to your future progress.
Oh no, what a disgrace! I’m sure my\nmaster will dock my pay for this.
The master I was serving disappeared one day.\nNow I am a masterless Butler--a ronin retainer!
Oh, Master, where art thou?
A Butler without a master is really no\nmore than a meddlesome old man.
Oh no! I forgot to take off\nmy uniform before I came!
Wow! Seriously? I won a battle?!\nThere’s no way I’m going back now!
Ahhhhh! And I lost!\nThis is not my day.
You know, I am very popular\nthanks to this costume of mine.
Being popular is simple.\nI like life to be simple.
It feels good to be popular, but\nsometimes I feel achingly empty.
Welcome, [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0908)]good sirfair lady. Shall I\ntake your coat for you?
You must be tired.\nPlease do rest awhile.
That was superb, [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0403)]sirmiss!\nYou are strong indeed.
I used to be popular, but\nnow I am all washed up.
I was overwhelmed by success. I took\nit for granted, and I didn’t work hard.
As times change, values also\nchange. I realized that too late.
Well, well, you strike impressive poses.\nIf you lose, I hope you’ll model for me.
I’ll do a sketch of you as you are now,\nfrustrated by failure. Please hold still.
Please wait! I’m sure I can create a\nmasterpiece with you as my model!
Sensitivity is important for battles,\ntoo. You! Start feeling right now!
You need to feel it more!\nMore! Or you’ll never win!
Ah! I sense it! I sense your\nhypersensitive sensitivity!
Action painting? That’s, like, so last\ncentury. Art today is all about inaction.
Inaction doesn’t mean do nothing! Did you hug\nan Electrode with the Static Ability or something?
Inaction may be the rage for art, but maybe\nit’s not such a great strategy for battling...
Inspiration... I need inspiration...\nSomeone, please, inspire me!
Ah! My muse! She has not abandoned me!\nI can feel it coming--the inspiration I need!
Hah... Hah... No, not yet!\nI still need more inspiration!
I dabbled in art like I dabble in Pokémon!\nDabbling is what keeps me from the rabble!
Hee hee hee! That was quite the scrabble!\nEven if you weren’t very good, I still enjoyed it!
You may think I’m just babbling,\nbut I sure love my artistic dabbling!
I’ll show you we can break you.\nWe’ve been training in the field!
How were my Pokémon?\nPowerful, weren’t they?
How strange... How could this be...\nI shouldn’t have been outmuscled.
Oh, you look lively!\nWhat d’ya say we battle?
OK! We’re all done here!\nHow were my partners?
My goodness, you are so young!\nMy partners were crushed!
Pokémon battles after work\nare the one joy in my life.
Ahhhhhhhhh! Yes, that hits the spot!\nThis is why I can’t give up Pokémon.
Urrrrrrrgh... You got me good!\nI’m single... Battling is my only pleasure in life.
Pokémon are popular at work, too.\nEven us guys enjoy these battles!
Aren’t I good for a guy who just\nbattles during his lunch breaks?
Old guys and kids can both\nenjoy battling with Pokémon.
I’ve trained and trained myself without stopping,\nso now I’m as fast as the wind!
No one can stop me now that\nI’m as fast as the wind itself!
Ow! Ow! Ow! My face!\nI’m the poster child for windburn!
I pledge myself now to the great roller spirits!\nMy love, my hopes, my vow... It’s all for you!
It’s like some sort of dream.\nShall I embrace this, too, great roller spirits?
Skates alive! What a battle!
Who was it?! Who’s the bad-mouther who\nsaid that I’m just barely skating by, huh?!
I would never just skate by in battle!\nEven if I am wearing Roller Skates!
I-I can’t even skate by anymore?\nThat’s it... I’m done. I’m retiring.
I’ve skated all the way here today!\nOver fields, mountains, and valleys!
That’s right! If you only have a pair of\nRoller Skates, you can go anywhere!
Hah... Hah... All that skating...\nIt really took it...out of me...
Halt, fool! I am the guardian of this\ncastle’s gardens! A ninja of nature!
Bwahahahah! My Pokémon’s\nninja skills are without equal!
Gasp! What maliciousness was in that move?!\nI see. So you must also be a ninja...
Stop! I’m going to have to ask you not to move.\nJust sit back and see what I do with my shears!
What a shame. It looks like I’ve dulled my\nprecious pruning shears on an ordinary weed.
You have shown quite the cutting prowess...\nI shall sharpen my shears to face you again.
If you don’t have great Pokémon, you’ll never\nhave a great battle.
It seems like you don’t even understand\nhow great your Pokémon could be.
It looks like I didn’t properly appreciate how\ngreat my own Pokémon could have been...
My last ever battle...\nThat’s the way I’d like us to view this match...
We will meet again someday...\nHeh. If only that were true...
It’s been fun...\nLet’s have another last battle again someday...
My disciples cover the world!\nI am the owningest of Owners!
I can own any Owners, after all.\nI can’t be defeated that easily.
Sacre bleu! As of this day, you’ve\nowned the Owner of all Owners!
Having carte blanche only leads to disaster.\nNo, I was never well suited to be an Owner.
Victory is a shallow and fleeting illusion.\nYour eventual defeat is a fait accompli.
They say with age comes wisdom, but\nthat never seems to have worked for me.
Adults have learned a lot of things kids don’t get.\nLike what is right...and what is fair...
Let me guess... You spend a lot of time blaming\nadults for things you think aren’t “fair,” don’t you?
Getting older is a one-way ticket.\nI regret nothing!
I’ve recently remade my life completely!\nI’ve been reborn as a Beauty at last!
If you want to make your dreams reality, then you\nhave to be completely dedicated!
Yes, a mere half year ago I was a Black Belt!\nQuite the transformation, wouldn’t you say?
It’s only the first day of my honeymoon\ntrip...and I’m already missing home.
Enough already! I just want to\ngo home! I miss my mother!
Sob... Sob... Who needs this?\nI’m going home to my mother!
Are you lost here? Are you lost here?\nBrother John, Brother John.
Winning bells are ringing, winning bells are ringing.\nDing ding dong! Ding ding dong!
Now my head is ringing, now my head is ringing.\nDing ding dong! Ding ding dong!
It’s my honeymoon! I’m on my honeymoon!\nI’m definitely not a crazy lady traveling alone!
A-and I’m on my honeymoon, you got that?!\nThat’s the most important point to remember!
I-I’ve got a husband... No, really, I do...\nBecause this is my honeymoon...see?
Hoard your money, then spend it all shopping!\nWe’re making the economy move here, people!
If you don’t work, you can’t shop till you drop!\nI work hard so I can waste my money like this!
Though I guess I should\nprobably be buying local...
A true Monsieur should\nhave a liking for battles.
A true Monsieur should bask in\nthe elegant glow of his victory.
A true Monsieur should accept the\nresults of battle with a stoic mind.
I will evaluate your ability.
Hmm... As a Trainer, you are\nat the level of a Preschooler.
Hmm... As a Trainer, you are\nat the level of a Poké Fan.
You can learn much from a mature woman,\nsuch as wisdom, grace, and good manners.
Woo-hoo! Take that! Were you knocked\nout by this Madame’s charm, or what?!
Did you enjoy the battle with me?
Ah-roo! Let us have an\nelegant and unique battle.
Ah-roo-goo-lah! I was not confident of\nmy skills, so this is a delightful surprise.
Ooh la la! I’ll pay you back for this someday!
Obedient Pokémon, selfish Pokémon...\nPokémon have unique characteristics.
You should not get angry at your\nPokémon, even if you lose a battle.
It is important to nurture and train\neach Pokémon’s characteristics.
Hmm, do you discipline your Pokémon?\nPampering them too much is no good.
No matter how much you love your Pokémon, you\nstill have to discipline them when they misbehave.
Too much praise can spoil\nboth Pokémon and people.
Pokémon never betray you. They\nreturn all the love you give them.
This proves my Pokémon\nhave accepted my love.
It’s about time for me to give\na human my affection, though.
Shall I give you a tip for\ntraining good Pokémon?
The real trick behind training good\nPokémon is catching good Pokémon.
You don’t seem to need any tips\nfor training good Pokémon.

Hello-how-are-ya? Are ya in good form?\nI’m Nita. Welcome to the Battle Maison, pet.\c\nSure, I may be the youngest of us four Battle\nChatelaine sisters, but I’m still a class Trainer.\c\nI’ve been an owner of the Battle Maison this\nlong while. Honest, I’m not telling fibs!\c\nI’d be in charge of the Single Battles myself.\nWould you do me a favor? Of a bit of a match?\c\nYou will? Grand! Then let’s begin at once!
Would you look at the cut of me Pokémon!\nWhat a battle, and me not trying for real even!\c\nOh, I’m scarlet for you, pet. Made a complete\nand utter hash o’ that one, didn’t you now?\c\nBut get you a bit more training, and you’ll\nbe grand. Trust me, training’s your only man.\c\nThe Battle Maison and Nita are both here and\nwaiting for a challenge every day o’ the year!\c\nWe’ll always be waiting for you! See you then!
That was great fun! En’t you a jammie one!\c\nBut I’ll tell you nicely, did I not hold back... Well...\c\nG’wan with you! If I were to pull out all the stops,\nit’d be none too nice for our guests, eh.\c\nMy older sisters are always on at me about that!\c\nSure, I let you have a win this time...\c\nBut if you seriously want to battle against me,\nyou wouldn’t be goin’ astray to train up a bit more.\c\nThanks a mill! You come back again sometime!
Uh-umm...\nW-welcome to the Battle Maison...\c\nMy name is Evelyn...\c\nI’ll t-try t-t-to serve you as a Battle Chatelaine\nlike my sisters, so...\c\nI’m the th-third of us four.\c\nM-my specialty is...\nDouble Battles...\c\nI guess...\c\nUmm...\n... ... ...\c\nTh-the weather is in a\nlovely way today, isn’t it?\c\n... ... ...\c\nOh, please! I’m sorry, but...\nPlease s-start the battle already!
I’m s-s-so sorry!\c\nI didn’t m-mean for anything like this to...\nIt wasn’t supposed to happen like this!\c\nI would have lost, I would! Oh no...\c\nI’m supposed to make sure that our\nfine guests have a grand time!\c\nSniffle... Sniffle... S-sob... I’m so sorry...\nI’ll be sure to r-really lose next time...\c\nSo please... Please come and challenge\nme to a Double Battle again...
O-oh! Fair play!\nYou’re quite strong, aren’t you, guest!\c\nNow that I’ve seen how strong you are,\nI feel I shouldn’t have held back.\c\nIt’s just that my elder sisters had asked me\nto take it a bit easy on new guests...\c\nThe next time that we battle, I will try\nmuch harder to beat you!\c\nP-please continue to patronize the Battle Maison...\nAnd to challenge me!
Welcome to the Battle Maison!\nI’m Dana. Thank you for coming.\c\nI am the second eldest of the four sisters who run\nthis Battle Maison.\c\nI am also a Triple Battle expert!\c\nSo come at me, young challenger!\nYes, the extent of your strength...\c\nI will be weighing it in a moment!
My, my, my... What a pity.\nIs that the end of things for you?\c\nI thought you had potential, but you\ncan’t get blood from a stone, after all.\c\nAway with you! I’m not interested in wasting time\nwith weak Trainers!\c\nIf that’s difficult for you to accept, come back\nand dare to challenge me again.\c\nAnd if you’re just going to give up, then why not\njust run home now to lick your wounds in shame?
Gasp...gasp...\nThat was quite...the performance...\c\nTruly...\c\nYou and your Pokémon...are truly...\c\nEhh, leave it out! Let’s drop the act.\c\nGood [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0403)]ladgirl, yourself. That’s the best trouncin’\nI’ve had in ages. Sure, in ages!\c\nIn fairness, I put on a bit of a show for the guests.\c\nBut I can’t act so high ’n’ mighty\nafter a savage battle like that one.\c\nNow, you leg it this instant before\nI consider fighting ye again right now!\c\nAway ye go and keep on winning!\c\n’Cause if ye do...\nI’ll show ye my real skills.\c\nYe’d do well to mind yerself then!
If you’re free for a time, come on by. ♪\nIf you’re bored for a while, stop on in. ♪\r\nBattle till you burst, oh, won’t you try. ♪\r\nIf you want to battle, the Battle Maison’s fine. ♪\c\nHee! What do you think of our song, [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0C06)]my ladyoung missie?\nWe had it written just for our wee Battle Maison.\c\nMusic can be a lovely distraction.\nDon’t you agree?\c\nOh, me. I’ve not even introduced myself,\nhave I? Well, don’t bite my head off!\c\nI’m the eldest of the four Battle Chatelaine sisters.\nDo call me Morgan.\c\nWe all thank you for coming to visit our\ncherished Battle Maison today.\c\nI tell you, I may not be a first-class Trainer,\nbut I’ll put everything I have into treating you\r\nto the loveliest battle you’ve ever known!
Thank you for the battle, love!\nDid you have a bit of fun yourself?\c\nI do hope you might find your way to stop by our\nBP shops as you go.\c\nWe have cracking good souvenirs for remembering\nyour time here at the Battle Maison.\c\nI’ll be taking me leave now, but I do look forward\nto your next visit.
Thank you for the battle, love!\nDid you have a bit of fun yourself?\c\nGet out of the garden! I had no idea you were\nsuch a fine Trainer!\c\nIt’s not just that you’re fearsome strong,\nthough you are, of course.\c\nYou have real style to you, too! Heh heh!\nI’ve taken quite a shine to you, my [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0408)]fine ladgirl!\c\nBut, unfortunately, we’ve run out of time for\nour wee battle today.\c\nI wait with bated breath for the next time\nyou come to challenge me!
Welcome to the Battle Maison![WAIT 30]\nI’m Dana. Thank you for coming.[WAIT 30]\c\nI am the second eldest of the four sisters who run[WAIT 30]\nthis Battle Maison.[WAIT 30]\c\nI will praise your bravery, at least, in attempting[WAIT 30]\na Multi Battle with me![WAIT 30]\c\nAnd, of course, I am hardly alone![WAIT 30]\c\n... ... ...[WAIT 30]\c\nOh, give me a break, Evelyn![WAIT 30]\nIt’s your line next! Come on!
Dana: Oh, goodness me. Isn’t this a shame?[WAIT 30]\nIt looks like you’re finished already.[WAIT 30]\c\nWell, at least you weren’t any worse than I had[WAIT 30]\nalready expected you to be...[WAIT 30]\c\nDon’t you agree? Evelyn?[WAIT 30]\c\n... ... ...[WAIT 30]\c\nOh, for pity’s sake, Evelyn! Wake up![WAIT 30]\nI’m morto for them and you! Honest!
Dana: Ugh...[WAIT 30]\nYou’re not bad, that’s for certain...[WAIT 30]\c\nTo think that you would be able to break through[WAIT 30]\nour perfect combo...[WAIT 30]\c\nBut my real stage is the Triple Battle![WAIT 30]\c\nAnd Evelyn’s speciality is Double Battle![WAIT 30]\c\nIf you took either of us on in our own specialties,[WAIT 30]\nwe’d never lose to you![WAIT 30]\c\nIsn’t that right, Evelyn?!
I-I-I’m sorry, Dana...[WAIT 30]\c\nU-um, my name is Evelyn...[WAIT 30]\nI-I-I’m usually in charge of Double Battles...[WAIT 30]\c\n... ... ...[WAIT 30]\c\nU-um...so...well...[WAIT 30]\c\nI’m not all flash like my sister Dana when it comes[WAIT 30]\nto talking...[WAIT 30]\c\n... ... ...[WAIT 30]\c\nU-umm! Please! I’m sorry, but...[WAIT 30]\nPlease start the battle already!
Evelyn: Huh? Wha-what?[WAIT 30]\nD-did you say something, Dana?[WAIT 30]\c\nI-I was so nervous...that I don’t remember a thing[WAIT 30]\no’ the battle.[WAIT 30]\c\nSniff...sniffle...[WAIT 30]\nOh, I am scarlet for myself...[WAIT 30]\c\nU-umm...I... I... I...[WAIT 30]\nTh-thank you for the battle![WAIT 30]\c\nP-please visit the Battle Maison again![WAIT 30]\nN-now...excuse me!
Evelyn: Wh-wha... Well, I never said...[WAIT 30]\c\nI-I don’t really think I’m all that good at[WAIT 30]\nDouble Battles either...[WAIT 30]\c\nA-and the reason that we just lost was because[WAIT 30]\nI’m so slow...[WAIT 30]\c\nS-so I don’t think these guests should expect[WAIT 30]\nmuch from me...[WAIT 30]\c\nI’d look a bit silly... Please...[WAIT 30]\nPick anything but Double Battle...[WAIT 30]\c\nN-now then... I’ll excuse myself...[WAIT 30]\nThank you for the battle...
W-w-welcome...[WAIT 30]\nTo the B-Battle Maison...[WAIT 30]\c\nU-um...[WAIT 30]\c\nWe would like to thank you...for choosing a[WAIT 30]\nMulti Battle today...[WAIT 30]\c\nS-so...um...[WAIT 30]\c\nYou will be facing my elder sister Morgan[WAIT 30]\nand me, Evelyn, today...
Evelyn: Th-th-thank you very much![WAIT 30]\c\nY-your Pokémon were brilliant![WAIT 30]\c\nI-I will also work hard, so you’ll never be stuck[WAIT 30]\nfor a challenge...[WAIT 30]\c\nSo please...[WAIT 30]\nCome to visit us at the Battle Maison again...
Evelyn: Um, fair play, you two![WAIT 30]\nYou were both so very strong![WAIT 30]\c\nTh-the truth is I was nervous facing two strangers[WAIT 30]\nat the same time.[WAIT 30]\c\nSo I don’t know what I did...[WAIT 30]\c\nB-but I will try even harder the next time that we[WAIT 30]\nhave a Multi Battle...[WAIT 30]\c\nSo please d-do definitely ask me to join you[WAIT 30]\nin a Multi Battle again.
Evelyn? Are you ready to begin?[WAIT 30]\nAre you nervous again, pet?[WAIT 30]\c\nRemember, it is very important to greet our[WAIT 30]\nprecious guests...[WAIT 30]\c\nI know some of these goofs like it when you[WAIT 30]\nwaffle about, so that’s fine for business, but...[WAIT 30]\c\n... ... ...Hmm?[WAIT 30]\nOh? Oh! Were you earwigging?[WAIT 30]\c\nWhat a cheeky bit you are![WAIT 30]\c\nI should not have been discussing[WAIT 30]\npersonal matters in front a guest.[WAIT 30]\c\nL-let’s just get straight to the battle, shall we?[WAIT 30]\nAnd not before time![WAIT 30]\c\nEvelyn and I will do our very best,[WAIT 30]\nthough we’re both quite hopeless at this!
Morgan: Oh, good on you, both of you two![WAIT 30]\nDid you enjoy our wee little combo?[WAIT 30]\c\nI’ve two other younger sisters, sure, in addition to[WAIT 30]\nmy shy Evelyn here.[WAIT 30]\c\nIf you happen to meet either of them, I trust they’ll[WAIT 30]\nshow you a good time.[WAIT 30]\c\nWe’ll all be looking forward to your next visit then![WAIT 30]\nDon’t work too hard!
Morgan: Oh, good on you, both of you![WAIT 30]\nDid you enjoy our little combo?[WAIT 30]\c\nOur Evelyn is quite reserved, so she gets a wee bit[WAIT 30]\nnervous in these big battles.[WAIT 30]\c\nBut she’d take you on handily in a Double Battle![WAIT 30]\nI hope you’ll claim a Double Battle with her soon.[WAIT 30]\c\nAnd of course I’d be tickled meself to see you in[WAIT 30]\none of my Rotation Battles.[WAIT 30]\c\nWe’ll all be looking forward to your next visit, then![WAIT 30]\nDon’t work too hard!
Glad you made it! It won’t\nbe an easy job from here.
Haha! What’d I tell ya?\nYou’re not ready yet.
I got a little carried away earlier,\nbut what job was I talking about?
Both my mom and my dad are\nAce Trainers. I’m probably an Ace, too!
I want to be a real Ace\nlike my mom and dad.
Waaah! I should have superior genes and\nbe able to ride on my parents’ coattails...
I don’t mind your lack of focus, but you\nwill get no sympathy from me if you lose.
Ah, you see? You didn’t focus on\nthe battle. That’s why you lost.
That’s quite enough focusing.\nStop staring at me like that!
Father... Mother...\nWatch over my battle...
Father... Mother... Did you see?\nI won a battle... I really won!
Father... Mother...\nWhat should I do?
I came here to goof off. I don’t\nwant to cram for the big test...
I can’t lose now... I don’t\nwant to study anymore!
No! I don’t want to go home!\nI don’t want to have to study!
I just want to be successful\nand grow rich someday.
My dream is simply to be rich.
I will be rich someday\nand put you to shame.
I don’t care who you are\nor where you come from.
How should we act and react?\nThat is all that matters, isn’t it?
A label is not important, is it?\nAfter all, you are yourself, right?
Pokémon battles and study sessions\nare much the same. Let’s be efficient!
You are too inefficient. You need\nto be more quick and responsive.
How did I lose against such\na slacker? I can’t believe it!
I have more money than I know what\nto do with. There’s nothing I really want.
The only thing I enjoy\nis a Pokémon battle...
Just because I’m rich, it\ndoesn’t mean I’m happy.
Yes! I’m a Rich Boy!
Good-bye! You’ve been\nbeaten by a Rich Boy!
Thank you! Merci bien!\nYou’ve beat a Rich Boy!
I just battle for fun,\nbut I’ll do my best.
Well, I only won by chance.\nPlease don’t pay it any mind.
It’s good to battle for fun. If it’s\ntoo serious, you won’t enjoy it...
Yesterday was a party. Today is a\nbattle. I’m rich--I always have fun!
I’ve never done a day of work,\nbecause I’m loaded with cash.
No work and all play makes me a dull\ngirl. Do you think I don’t know that?
Go, my precious Pokémon!\nTo battle! Rush the enemy!
My Pokémon are the mightiest!\nI shall carve my name in history!
I won’t cry... I won’t.\nSomeday, I will win.
I came here for my big brother\nwho always hides in his room.
My big brother, look outside for once!\nI won for you! So come out and play!
I wish my big brother would come\nout of his room and play with me...
Hello, me old china,\ntime for the rhyma!
Bit of a Pokémon read and\nwrite, Trainer, many clinks!
Even though I lost, I’ll be\nfine. Best of luck, Trainer!
All Mom and Dad do is mumble\nat their computers! It’s no fun!
I don’t like Mom or Dad or their silly\ncomputers! All I need are Pokémon!
I wish they would talk to me\ninstead of their computers...
A globe-trotting young\nadventurer. That’s me!
Seeing Pokémon from all over the\nworld is the purpose of my journey.
Adventure is calling me.\nFarewell! See you again!
Let’s take it easy with\nPokémon and with life.
It’s OK to bust your tail. But you\nneed some breathing room, too.
No problem. No problem.\nI’ll have another chance.
Eww, don’t tell me this is one of THOSE\nregions. You expect me to tip the plebs?
Hmph! Looks like no tip is necessary.\nThen I guess this region isn’t all bad.
Tsk! I’m not paying any tip, you hear?
Every time I travel, I find myself thinking\nthe same thing. Do you know what it is?
That in the end, east or west, home is best.
That if your life can really be changed by\ntraveling, you haven’t been living it right.
I’ll always work part-time, ’cause it\nlets me focus on what I really love.
You only ever get one life to live.\nAre you doing what you want to do?
I want to play here forever\nwithout being tied down.
I took this job because I wanted\nto see smiles on people’s faces.
Oh... Don’t look at me\nlike that. Smile! Smile!
Losing is frustrating, but\nI’m glad I saw you smile.
Let’s start the battle!\nTime’s a-wasting!
What? Is it already over?\nWe still have lots of time.
WHAT?! It’s already time?\nAnd we can’t go into overtime!
I’m battling here to promote\nthe café that I’m working at.
You’re not that strong, so we\ndon’t need you in our café.
Yowza! What a strong Trainer!\nCome to my café next time, OK?
Join the Pokémon Fan Club!\nYour life will be happy!
If you join the Pokémon Fan Club,\nyou’ll be strong, like me!
If you join the Pokémon Fan Club,\nyour life will be saved!
I am not a regular Poké Fan.\nI am a major mega-Poké Fan!
I love Pokémon...\nI love, love, love Pokémon!
Remember this, you!\nI am a big Poké Fan!
I think I am a Poké Fan,\ntherefore I am a Poké Fan.
The Poké Fan is power.
You should remember\nthis: I am a Poké Fan.
There are young and beautiful people,\nbut youth is different from beauty.
If I’d only known that when I was young, I\nwouldn’t be having such a hard time now...
Youth is just youth. I wish\nI had realized it back then.
Ho there! You are a mountain\nstanding in my way, aren’t ya?
Yahoo! Yahooooo!!\nHear my cry of triumph!
Grrr... My victory has disappeared\ndown into some dark crevasse...
Hi! Sorry to keep you waiting!\nI’m a Hiker with a cult following!
Oh no! It’s over already?\nThe Hiker hunk is bored!!
This is important, so remember it:\ndon’t judge a book by its cover!
Even if it’s tough, even if it’s painful,\nI’mma do it! I’m a Trainer, dagnabbit!
I was born to do battle, ya hear?!\nI’m a darn tootin’ Trainer! I am!
Blast it all! And it’s all mah own fault! I’ve\ngotta apologize to mah sweet Pokémon!
Just because they’re both decided by who wins\nand who loses, don’t liken a battle to a game!
Fair play? What’re you talking about?\nIs that some kind of loser thing?
This...this can’t be... How could\nI be beaten at my own game...
My wovely widdle Pokémon are\ngonna take you apart, mmkay?
Don’t you worry your silly widdle head!\nI’ll take away ALL your pain, mmkay?
Oh phooey! Don’t you ever come back!\nIf you do, we’re gonna end you, mmkay?
Like a fragment of a forgotten dream, a\nmysterious Pokémon beckons to you...
Shhh. Rest now and close your eyes...\nYou won’t ever need open them again...
Being defeated by you makes this waking world\nseem even less believable than my dreams...
Everyone should just disappear!\nI don’t need anyone but Pokémon!
Humans should be gone from this world!\nI don’t like anything or anyone but Pokémon!
Wh-why do my Pokémon look like they\nare having so much fun battling you?
You have your way.\nAnd I have my way.
I will go my way because\nI don’t have any other way.
Your way must be rocky. Good luck\nto you. I am behind you all the way.
Hey, you! Don’t mess with me,\nor I will destroy your Pokémon!
Thought you might make trouble\nfor me, but what a wimpy attack!
How could I lose to such a wimpy move?\nGaaahhh, that bugs the snot out of me!
My dad and mom are both\nVeterans, but I am a loser...
I wonder if my mom and dad will be sad\nif they see that I’ve become a Punk Guy.
I can’t be like my mom and dad.\nSo I’ve gotta live as a Punk Guy.
Y’know, the truth is I really wanna be a normal girl\nand be all lovey-dovey with a normal boyfriend...
Sniffle... Maybe it’s ’cause I’m so stupidly\nstrong that no normal boys come near me...
I just want a boyfriend! No, not just any boyfriend--\nI want a silly boyfriend I can be lovey-dovey with!
Man, the bad things I used to get up to...\nI’ve done a little of this and whole lotta that.
This, that, and the other were like\nmy thing, you know what I’m saying?
But I guess that this and that are\ntwo totally different things, huh?
You wanna fight me? You do know I come from a\nlong line of punks, right? You’ve got guts, at least.
I’ll let you go this time. Get stronger,\nthen come back and fight me again.
Heh... I regret nothing... It was\na fight worth my family’s honor...
I’m warning you now--if you lose to me,\nyou’ll be smelling the rank scent of defeat!
Mm-hmm! So fragrant! Such a bouquet!\nLet me get another whiff of victory!
Hm, hm, hm! There was no avoiding it!\nYour Pokémon give off a real aroma of victory!
I, the great Dariole, fear\nnothing under the sky!
Mehehehehe... You fool!\nYou know not your place!
Feh! I will at least admit that you\nhave a skill for feigning strength.
“Une apple a day keeps ze doctor away.”\nAre you familiahr with zis saying?
You are what you eat, n’est-ce pas? And\nit seems you could use a pinch of ze winning.
If you want to win, ze whining, it will not\nhelp! Neizer will ze wurst, I’m afraid...
Y-you... How can this be... It is like seeing\nmy former master alive in the flesh again!
Thank goodness... In terms of strength, at least,\nyou have little resemblance to my former master.
Even your strength is just as my master’s was!\nP-please! Allow me to serve at your side!
The International Butlering Competition is drawing\nnear, so allow me to practice my skills on you!
Now, let’s see... If I accidentally beat my master...\nI know! I get on my knees and beg for forgiveness!
Now, let’s see... If my master easily defeats me...\nI know! That is the ideal moment for some flattery!
Always workin’ me to the bone, like I ain’t\neven worth their time of day or nuttin’!
What a waste! If only I could beat those\nrich jerks I work for this nice and easy!
What a bunch of louts! Don’t they even get that\nI’m always working my tail off over here!
Talk is unnecessary...\nI will just break you...
What? Are you broken already?
Ugh, I’m broken...
I have very low self-esteem, so I like\nhaving someone else give me orders.
Well, you’re not my master, so I\nguess you can’t help being weak.
Ohhh... Could you please give me an order?
This isn’t a uniform--it’s just what\nI like to wear. I made it myself.
This is a uniform from an anime.\nDoesn’t it look good on me?
I wish I could live in the worlds that\nI see in games, anime, and comics.
I’m not cut out for a regular\njob, so I make my living on art.
I envy Pokémon, ’cause they’re so\ncarefree. I want to be a Pokémon.
Bah! If I could do a regular job, I’d\nquit this stinking art in a second.
Every time a Pokémon uses a\nmove, my heart trembles!
Nothing stirs the soul\nlike Pokémon moves.
Aha! Pokémon moves are so\nbeautiful! I could almost faint!
I will make you cry, ’cause you\njust don’t know when to quit.
A state of deep sorrow and\nconfusion can also be art.
Someday, you will appreciate\nthe value of defeat and sorrow.
(This kid looks like a real sucker. All right!)\nOhhhh, poor me! No one understands my art...
I’d love to do a painting of you, you know.\n(Because I could sell it for a mint! Hah!)
Please come to the gallery to see my works!\n(You look dumb enough to buy something!)
The battle between us two...\nWithin and of itself, that is art.
Yes... I shall name this piece...\n“The Pitiful and Somehow Unsightly Youth.”
Yes... I shall name this piece...\n“The Tragic and Yet Alluringly Beautiful Artist”!
I collect the random scribbles of Pokémon, then\nsell ’em as “art.” I’m makin’ a fortune over here!
It’s like stealin’ candy from a baby!\nI’m livin’ the good life, all right!
The ones to blame are the ones who buy this junk.\nThey’re the ones who think it’s worth something.
The job site can be quite dangerous, but\nI have to keep working with my Pokémon.
I have trained my Pokémon well,\nand it’s ready to go to the job site.
Ugh. I won’t be able to make any\nmoney tomorrow with these injuries!
Welcome, welcome! Step right up!\nStep right up and battle a spell!
Only the winner! Yes, sir!\nOnly the winner can celebrate!
Enough... That’s enough...
I do menial work every single day.\nAm I just a cog in the machine?
I am well broken in. No snags slow down\nthe smooth running of this machine!
I guess I’m happier than a person who\ncannot even be a cog in the machine.
Yo, kid! Are you new? I’m the Worker\nthat everybody’s always talking about.
If you don’t know me, you’re bogus!\nGood-bye! The Worker is heading out.
Kid! Remember me! I am the\nWorker everybody talks about!
There are no such things\nas brakes on MY skates!
I won’t stop! Well, I can’t stop!\nHey, that’s just the way I roll!
They’ve gotta be defective or something!\nPlease! Someone! Anyone! STOP ME!
I started skating because I’d heard that girls\nliked guys who skate. It’s not working at all.
Tell me the truth... Roller skating\nisn’t even cool anymore, is it?
And I’m terrible at Pokémon battles, too!\nNow I’m never gonna get a girlfriend...
No matter how speedy the Pokémon is,\nI’ll catch it on my super-speedy skates!
No Pokémon or Trainer can escape me on my\nspeedy skates!
Man, I’m so speedy and smooth! I should\nbe on “So You Think You Can Skate!”
Five seconds. You got that? I’m gonna\nwipe the floor with you in five seconds.
What? You say that was over five seconds?!\nTime moves differently in my world, OK?!
The moment that I hadn’t beat you in five\nseconds, I’d already lost...to myself.
C’mon, pal. I’m just a newbie over here.\nYou’re gonna take it easy on me, right?
N-no! This is, uh...just a\nfluke! I really am a noob!
Whatever. That’s, like, sooo amazing.\nYou really showed me, huh? Really.
Ngh! Nosebleed! When I get too excited,\nmy blood pressure goes through the roof!
I just can’t stop these blasted nosebleeds!\nEvery time I get excited or nervous... Argh!
Uhhh... It’s not...stopping...\nI’m starting to feel...kinda...dizzy...
You’re a rather delicate-looking little\nthing, hmm? Sure you’re up for a battle?
See? What did I tell you?\nAre you ill or something?
Whoa-ho! Sorry for jumping to conclusions!\nWho’d have ever guessed you were strong!
Hey! You! Yeah, you! Let’s work\nup a good sweat together, right?
Hey, don’t sweat it... Sometimes\nyou’ve just gotta learn to let it go.
You had me sweating bullets there!\nThat’s what being young is all about!
I didn’t choose to be born a woman, OK?\nI didn’t choose to grow up and be beautiful!
Hey, it’s not like I chose for the battle to\ngo this way, all right? Don’t go blaming me.
Appearing, battling, then disappearing again...\nIt’s not like I was born just to play this bit part!
Breathe deeply of my perfume before you\ngo. Get a whiff of a real Beauty’s aroma!
Oh my, did you get too close? What\nare you, some kind of perfume fanatic?
The truth is that my “perfume” is nothing more\nthan the scent of my cheap fabric softener.
The endless process of entropy...\nThat is where nature’s true beauty lies.
It is only right to be who and what you are. Do\nnot fight it. Just leave yourself in fate’s hands.
You don’t understand? Well, neither do I.\nIt’s really just something I heard somewhere.
Ooh la la! Little Trainer! Graceful blossom!\nI’m going to snippety-snip you right at the stem!
La, la, oomph! Now where shall I\nstart pruning, eh? Snippety-snip!
N-non! Not so fast! I mean you to\nbe the prize bloom in my garden!
Watch out! You’re on the menu next!
What a pushover you were!\nThat was a piece of cake, my little cream puff!
Oh... I think I’ll go back to the kitchen and\nhave a nice slice of some humble pie...
Ready for the big game?\nGot your cap on straight?
My oh my!\nMy Pokémon knocked it out of the park!
Hey, another out. So what?\nWe’ll come back! We always do!
Grip and rip, baby! I’m going to capture\nevery moment of this trip for posterity!
Here, here! Take my camera, and get a shot of\nme looking awesome after beating you in battle!
I don’t need any memory like this! Who\nwants to remember their failures? Delete!
Three-star restaurants? Shopping? Sightseeing?\nIt’s all so...so ANNOYING! I’m about to lose it!
Everything is about what SHE wants to do...\nExactly what part of this is “our” honeymoon, huh?
You’d better remember this for your future, kid.\nNothing ruins a honeymoon quite like a spouse!
Farewell, hearth and home and all\nI know! I shall become a Tourist!
Yes, a man must take at least one great journey!\nEven if my $1 flight ended up costing me $400...
I leave my beloved family behind in my hometown\nand set out upon my lonely journey of a lifetime!
An airplane that soars across the sky, leaving\ntrails of jet stream behind it... That is how I fly!
Indeed! This is my moment of takeoff!\nI’m taking off from you! Eat my dust!
To think that I was grounded due to you...\nOhhh! I’d better get a hotel voucher at least!
I can’t tell my new husband now, of course,\nbut the truth is that I used to be a Punk Girl!
Hiding any unpleasant details of my past...\nAin’t I just the picture of a perfect wife?
Ehhh, off with you! If you don’t, I’m gonna make\nyou listen to me gush about my husband all night!
I’m going to battle you with the Pokémon that\nmy darling gave me as a symbol of our love!
A win for the love between me and\nmy darling... It will burn forever!
Y-you defeated the symbol of our love...\nDoes that mean that we’re over already?
I have raised these very special\nPokémon using a special method.
Pokémon will be strong or weak\ndepending on how you raise them.
Ugh... It wasn’t supposed to be like\nthis. Did I administer the wrong blend?
Shall I share an exclusive tip\nfor training great Pokémon?
You’ll be perfect if you buy my\nbook of Pokémon training tips.
You’ll be fine if you buy my\nDVD of Pokémon training tips.
Pokémon are my family! See\nthe solidarity of my family!
Well done, brothers and sisters!\nOur family solidarity is invincible!
NO! My...my family!\nWhat have you done?!
What you like doing and what you’re\ngood at doing aren’t always the same.
I’m good at battling, but\nI don’t enjoy it very much.
If you like what you do as a job, you\nhave a sense of fulfillment, don’t you?
Let me be brief.\nYou cannot win against me.
You see, you cannot win,\nbecause you are very weak.
Hummmm... You are good.\nYou are really pretty good.
Don’t underestimate me because I am\nold. I’ll show you my rejuvenating attack!
I’m old but still going strong!\nI can take care of myself!
What a cruel way to treat such a\nhelpless old man! Shame on you!
I would like to retire soon...but I have\nno one to carry on the family business...
If I’d had a child like you, my golden\nyears would have been carefree...
I wish my son were\nas mature as you are.
I feel sad whenever I see a\nbright, young child like you.
The first flush of youth...\nIt is too bright for me...
Sparkling eyes, firm skin...\nI won’t get them back.
Don’t you think it’s a bit too much? This kimono?\nBut, well, I can only pull it off while I’m still young.
The kinds of fashion you can pull off have\na pesky expiration date. We call it “age.”
And, well, I suppose that when I’m older...\nThis kind of getup will be too much hassle!
The story has it that this precious kimono was\npassed down within my family for generations...
Excuse me! Would you keep your distance!\nWhat if you got my precious kimono dirty?!
Look, truth is that “passed down for generations”\nthing is a joke. Who’d be caught dead in this?
Hey! It’s me. It’s me!\nThe Owner of the world!
How’s that?\nOwned, suckah!
Pffft! I wasn’t seriously trying or nothing!\nNext time I’ll show you some real ownage!
Watch out! I’m always ripped and raring to go!\nShow me a Pokémon that’s beyond the beyond!
Take that! My Pokémon have never\neven heard of words like sedate!
Not yet! My Pokémon can still stand!\nIt’s not over! They can still stand!
My research will lead this\nworld to peace and joy.
I am a genius. I will control\nthe future of the world!
I am a genius... I am not supposed\nto lose against someone like you...
Only my research is left in my life.\nI abandoned my family and friends.
It’s not bad to devote my\nwhole life to research, is it?
Dedicating yourself completely to\nsomething can cause loneliness.
Mwahahahaha... Please lend\nme a hand for my experiment.
Mwahahaha... Yes, I did it! The\nexperiment was a huge success.
Ho-hum. This is not good...\nThe experiment was a failure...
You must face off against my\nsuper-powered-up Pokémon!
Well, it is only the natural outcome.\nThe power of science is awesome.
Your Pokémon have a strength\nbeyond the power of science.
If you lose, I’ll have you help\nme with my latest experiment!
Mwahahaha! You lost! Now\nstep right this way, Subject A...
Pah. I was sooo close to signing\nyou up as my new test subject!
Why do people compete and fight?\nThis is the subject of my research.
Even if you win, you will hurt\nyour opponent’s feelings.
If you lose, you may\nresent your opponent.
Hi! Focus!
Fooooo!
Eeeeek!
Speech can be utter nonsense.\nPretty words only taint battles...
Trainers who treat battles as a\nsport are the height of vileness.
Defeat is worth nothing.\nLosers don’t need words...
Heh-heh-heh. If you lose,\nI’ll turn you into a Pokémon.
Heh-heh-heh. From today on,\nyou are already a Pokémon!
Next time I see you, I will turn you\ninto a Pokémon with my power.
I normally only ever listen to classical music,\nbut if I lose, I think I shall try a bit of new age!
New age simply refers to twentieth\ncentury classical composers, right?
Is this the dawning of\nthe age of Aquarius?
Heheh... I see it all clearly... You are a\ndoctor from an evil planet, aren’t you?
That was some kind of loss.\nWas there some sort of trap?!
Ugh... My powers... My powers\nare... I think I need a nurse...
You certainly look pleased with yourself.\nJust being near you makes me gloomy.
Now you’ve been dragged down, too.\nI think we could become friends now.
I hate the happiness of others...\nI’m just that sort of person, OK?
I praise your courage in challenging me!\nFor I am the one with the strongest kick!
Haha... I probably did not have\nto use my strongest kick on you.
Oh. The Pokémon did the fighting.\nMy strong kick didn’t help a bit.
’Sup! I’ll give it all I’ve\ngot! Let’s do our best!!
’Sup! That’s enough, friend!\nYou gotta value your life, yo!
’Sup! Good work. I tried everything I\ncould, but I’m still pretty disappointed, yo!
Yo!
Yo! Yo! Yo!
Yo!
You don’t have to try to impress\nme. You can lose against me.
Come. Sleep quietly in my arms...
It’s hard to say good-bye, but\nwe are running out of time...
Are you ready? I’m\ntaking my gloves off.
Well, well... You’re not even in\nmy league. This is like bullying.
Aww... I cannot believe\nI lost! Who are you?!
I sure would like to do the fighting\ninstead of my Pokémon, if I could.
Pokémon battles are not enough of a\nchallenge. I want it to be personal!
Ah, I tingle with excitement.\nI sure would like to fight...
Halt at once! You there!\nLet us cross lances!
Trainer, you are at my mercy!
Trainer, I yield!\nPlease spare me!
When I am surrounded by nature,\nmost other things cease to matter.
I won the battle. But victory is nothing\ncompared to the vastness of nature...
It doesn’t matter to the vastness\nof nature whether I win or lose...
Despite my appearance, I was born a\ncity boy. I yearned for country life.
Do you have a nice small hometown?\nIf so, you should go back and visit there.
I don’t have a small hometown to go back\nto, ’cause I was born and raised in the city.
It’s my mission to protect nature\nand all the Pokémon living there!
If villains disturb the natural\norder, I will put them in jail!
Protect Mother Nature!\nOr I will put you in jail!
We need a lot of money to protect\nMother Nature and her Pokémon.
Please donate money for a rich, healthy\nenvironment and for the sake of Pokémon.
We protect forests and Pokémon by\ngathering money and planting trees.
Let me stop your winning streak here.
Ah. You still have much to learn.\nLet me give you a crash course!
You didn’t win alone. You couldn’t\nhave won without your Pokémon.
You seem quite confident.\nI’ll sink you straightaway.
I am devoting my body and\nsoul to Pokémon battles!
AAAH! I am sooo scared!\nI will never do it again... Sorry!
I’m working very hard, but that\ndoesn’t mean that I’m strong.
You’re a strong Trainer, so I\nthink I was just lucky this time.
What?! Even I can lose?!\nBut I’m a battling genius!
I started battling just to be cool, but\nI became an Ace before I knew it.
People can become strong if they have\nclear goals. That’s just the way it goes.
But I’m still not cool even though\nI’ve been recognized as an Ace...
The main character of this\nstory... I’ll tell you who it is!
The main character of the story\nis me! You are just an extra!
Of course, you are\nthe main character!
We would like to hold a Pokémon\nbattle against the strongest foe.
We cannot believe we spent time on\nsuch a childish battle! Leave at once!
Ho ho ho! That was to our liking!\nWe find ourselves quite satisfied!
A person who wants to fight, fight, and\nfight forever. That’s the way of the Ace.
However hard they battle, they won’t be\nsatisfied. That is a real Trainer, isn’t it?
Your fighting style suits you very\nwell. You could be an Ace Trainer.
I can see the despair in\nyour eyes. Bring it on!
It was a waste of time, much as I suspected.\nYou should consider starting over from zero.
Did I underestimate you? Or was\nit your true ability that let you win?
Hey, you, young Trainer.\nI’m utterly stylish, aren’t I?
I’m so stylish, I hypnotize myself!\nYou’d better keep your distance!
I’m a wreck. I’m adrift. It just kills\nme. It’s so hard to be too stylish.
I won’t lose against a kid like you who\ndoesn’t know anything about battles.
You really are an amateur. No sweat.\n(Whew... That was a little too close!)
What? This kid is a fast learner?\nHahaha... I-I knew that, of course!
Ugh. Cough, cough! I don’t feel so\nwell. Please show a little kindness...
I lied when I said I didn’t feel well!\nVeterans will do anything to win!
You’re very sharp! You didn’t\nfall for my fake sickness, huh?
Come. I will give you a taste of a\nVeteran’s well-trained Pokémon.
How were the Veteran’s Pokémon?\nDefeat tastes quite bitter, doesn’t it?
You have served me a spicy defeat.\nAnd yet defeat is also part of life.
Oh, you are so cute! Come, I\npromise to be nice this battle.
You are just too, too cute. You are!\nI want to see you again. I’ll be waiting!
Your battle is too cute, too!\nLet’s play again sometime.
Oh? Aren’t you a child? Who\nsaid you could come here?
You’re not bad, but you’re immature.\nCome back when you’ve learned a bit.
I thought you were a child.\nHee hee... You are tough...
Don’t you call me a Veteran! A\nwoman is always young at heart!
I’m not finished with love or Pokémon!\nI’ll stay fit and ready for both all my life!
I have pains in my eyes, my shoulder, and\nmy back, but my heart is forever young.
I am the strongest Backpacker.\nI have lots of Pokémon in my Bag.
Hahaha! I am as big as my\nbackpack, aren’t I? Aren’t I?
I have more Pokémon in my Bag!\nOh... Wait... My Bag has a hole...
I’m not traveling in\nsearch of freedom.
You’re carrying bulky luggage,\nbut do you really need it all?
My Bag is like the sky...\nIn other words, it is empty.
Oh bother! It’s just SUCH a hassle the way\nthat I am always winning with my Pokémon!
Oh! Bother and vexation! This is just too much!\nI can’t stand how good it feels to win all the time!
Hey, can’t you take a hint?\nI was trying to fake you out!
They say that the rich don’t have to fight\nfor anything, but I LOVE a good battle!
This buzz after battle is the best!\nIt’s like I just closed a big deal!
If you want to dream big, then you’ll need to\nbuild up a whole lot of experience in battle!
Hey! Hey! Please check\nout my cute Pokémon!
How about that? I’m\nproud of my Pokémon.
Oh no, don’t bother them like that!\nPlease leave my Pokémon alone...
Being a Garçon is my disguise,\nand it helps me live a quiet life.
On my days off, the real me can\nappear! Yes, I am an Ace Trainer!
I’m struggling to make a living, so\nI’ve been in disguise a long time.
My Pokémon are the strongest.\nI don’t think I will lose to you.
Did you think you could beat\nme with such wimpy Pokémon?
Ah... It’s hard. It sure\nis frustrating to lose.
Don’t you think a restaurant\nfor Pokémon is a fun idea?
I wonder if people will order a\nfull-course meal for Pokémon.
It’s a restaurant for Pokémon,\nnot a restaurant of Pokémon!
Harrumph! Harooo!
Harooo!
Harrumph!!
I am the great mountain range of\nyour life! Overcome me if you can!
Hahaha! I am the summit, and the\nroad to reach me is still very steep!
Finally, someone has climbed\nthe mountain! This is my summit!
I’m gonna give you an experience so\nsweet that your eyes are gonna spin!
The dazzling romance of battle will\nmake you grow into a real adult...
Phew... You are smoking hot! It’s like\na sweltering summer night in here!
The pretty-suited Pokémon soldier who\nsprinkles love on the world appears!
Take that, evildoer! I am the pretty\nsoldier of “Prettiness and Pokémon”!
I can’t be defeated yet... I still have to\nprotect all that is pretty in the world...
Scary places are the best to me.\nI’d love to live in a cemetery...
Healing sites are nice, too, but they\ncan’t hold a candle to haunted sites!
In a cemetery where the party begins\nafter the day ends. Yes, that’s the life for me...
I may look like this now, but I was\nonce a Beauty, too, you know!
I’m super popular with ghosts, but we have\nvery ethereal relationships.
After I was dumped by my boyfriend, I fell into\ndepression. Before I knew it, I looked like this!
I can really cut loose in Pokémon\nbattles without getting scolded.
Nobody scolds me. That’s why\nPokémon battles are the best!
You like a big fight, don’t\nya? You’re my new pal!
My ’net friends said I wouldn’t\nbe taken lightly with this look.
I won, but I was so scared...\nMaybe I’m not cut out for this.
Eek! I should’ve stayed\nin my room with my PC!
Sorry, pal. Nothing personal, but I’m abouts\nto go all kinds of crazy on your Pokémon!
My bad, my bad! Little too much for ya, huh?\nBut there’s no pullin’ punches in a fight, amirite?
Arghhh! You little--! That HURTS.\nBut, well, that’s how it goes, yeah?
Yo. You ready to start this already?\nI ain’t long in the way of patience.
Sucks, don’t it? If you don’t like that feeling,\nyou better be ready to do anything to win!
That’s fine by me! I like a strong partner! But\nyou’d never take me in a bare-knuckle fight.
I’m about to serve you up a slice of battle so\nexquisite you’ll think I’m the cream of the crop!
So? It was delicious, right?!\nHave some more then! MORE!
Stop right there! We haven’t\nreached the final course yet!
Slobber... Oooh, a tasty-looking Trainer\nand Pokémon have wandered my way...
Yum-yummm, you all look\ndelicious... Bagon appetite!
Mehehehe... Got away this time, did you?\nI’ll definitely be Gulpin you down next time!
I used to get two minutes of sleep per\nday. Being a Butler was one hard job.
I don’t know if they thought\nI was a Butler or a robot...
Change! It’s time for a change! I couldn’t\ntake that kind of job a single day longer!
I’m tired of doing nothing but serving...\nSo I think it’s time for you to serve me!
Outstanding! From this day,\nyou may call me “Master”!
No...wait... Don’t run away...\nYou’re supposed to be my Butler...
If you lose, you can be my servant.
From now on, I am your employer.
I’ll make you my servant someday.
Ahhhh... So strange.\nI feel very, very tired.
I still feel kind of\nblah. I’m all achy...
I really feel blah...\nI think I’ll go home.
A child like you cannot understand\nthe kind of beauty that I am pursuing.
I am a loyal servant to beauty.\nUgly defeat does not suit me.
Perhaps the beauty I’ve\nbeen looking for...is you?
I paint pictures and live with\nPokémon. I’m enjoying my life!
The sting of defeat will become a\ngood memory when you grow older.
Experience hardships when you’re still\nyoung. Old bodies just can’t take them.
All right, then. I’ll watch you.\nLet your passions run wild!
What? You’re done already?\nNo, I’ll have none of that!
Heheheh... Are you sure? Don’t\nyou think you could keep going?
Heehee! If you wanna see some of\nmy art, it’s displayed all over the city!
Who needs a gallery, huh?!\nThe streets are my art show!
The days that I spend dedicated to\nmy art... That is the art of youth!
If you work diligently,\nyou will get results.
You, keep trying.\nMaster the basics.
Well, even if you work diligently,\nthings don’t always go as hoped.
I’ve arrived from a distant island.\nMay I please trouble you for a battle?
I have won.
I was utterly inexperienced. I’d be\ngrateful if I could be your pupil.
I am so obsessed with Pokémon,\nmy wife is fit to burst with anger!
Pokémon battles are so much\nfun. There’s no way I can quit!
I don’t want to go home, ’cause my wife\nis as scary as a Legendary Pokémon.
Our lives have plenty of ordinary\ndays...so I gotta have Pokémon!
Only Pokémon rescue me from\nboring and monotonous days.
When I look at a special\nperson like you, I just melt.
The thrill and adrenaline has me racing!\nYou look like you’re almost standing still!
By putting yourself into a corner,\nyou draw out your full potential!
Everything feels clearer when you get this\nexcited! I can’t stop this dangerous game!
I won’t get mad if you beat\nme. It’s just a game, after all!
Don’t get mad over something like this. There\nare things in the world more worthy of anger.
It doesn’t matter at all who wins or loses\na game. The one who had fun is the real winner.
You have to cut down on resistance\nif you want to go as fast as you can!
I want to melt right into that blurry scenery\nthat you can only see when going so fast.
Perhaps I could have gone even\nfaster if you hadn’t resisted me?
I’m the infamous “Cannon Girl” that all the town\nis raging about! I’ll blast right into your heart!
I’m fast! I’m strong! I’m lovely!\nNothing less for the Cannon Girl!
Blast!
Lemme tell you, I’m mighty strong. Don’t\ncome whining to me after I warned you.
Well, aren’t you quite pathetic? This is what\nhappens when you can select an opponent.
Hey, now, just a minute there!\nI haven’t lost this thing yet!
Do not mistake the means for the goal.\nThat is what my master once taught me.
The battle is just the means.\nVictory is always the goal.
For you to defeat me like this...\nWhat is the goal you strive for?
Oooh! I’ve spotted some handy prey!\nThe hunt is about to begin... Game on!
C’mon, prey! You’ve gotta struggle\na bit more, or it’s not any fun for me!
Ohhh, a strong enemy! Is there\na continue option somewhere?
My Pokémon are my pride and joy, so take\nyour time and enjoy this battle with them.
Your Pokémon seem to be lacking a\nwee bit in the power department, friend.
Ahhh... That’s a fine, good Pokémon you\nhave. How would you fancy a wee trade?
“Harsh” and “bitter” are flavors in any good\nChef’s repertoire! Would you like a taste?
Your battling was bland, I’m afraid. What did you\nexpect to happen when you’re so unseasoned?
Yes, the harshness of that defeat...\nThe bitterness on my tongue now... It’s perfect!
I’m going to tell you something valuable:\nnever expect much from a famous food!
You expect too much of something famous, and\nyou just end up disappointed by reality.
“It’s even better than I thought it would be!”\nIf you can think that, you’ll walk away happy.
All right then. Let’s all be good little children\nand start our Pokémon lesson, shall we?
Oh my...\nIt looks like you’ll be repeating this lesson.
Oh my!\nYou’ve passed with flying colors!
Hey... Can I ask you a question?\nWhen did you start loving your Pokémon?
I’ve always loved my Pokémon.\nI really thought that was true, but...
I guess it’s more important to ask how long\nyou’ll keep loving them, though, isn’t it?
Being called a Beauty doesn’t excite me\nat all. It just seems like cheap flattery.
Certain types of people use sweet talk\nno matter what you look like. It’s meaningless.
It’s just plain creepy when someone uses\ncompliments to win your attention. Ugh!
Come on, let’s get on with it already!\nNo need to worry about particulars!
Regrets from the past, worries about the future--\nforget all that! All that matters is here and now!
Even if I try to forget, I can’t remember...\nThat’s probably all I need to know, isn’t it?
D’ya, uh, know where my little lady is?\nSeems like she’s gone up and missing...
Someone like me winning something like a battle?\nCity slickers sure are weak these days, ain’t they?
My little lady’s never been to a city like this’n.\nMay’ve bitten off more’n we can chew. Uh-huh.
Don’t these kind of guided tours make you\nfeel like you’re really not used to traveling?
Who was I kidding--going on a trip?\nAt home, I just hide inside. By myself...
Why’d I bother screwing up my courage to come\non a trip anyway? I should’ve just stayed home...
Ahhh! Blast! Where’d that useless\nhusband of mine get off to now?!
Ditching his new bride like this... He...he\ncan’t possibly be getting cold feet now?!
You’re even wilder than my new\nhusband... Oh no, this is just...
Woo-hoo! My husband got food poisoning,\nso now I get to do whatever I want to do!
Ahhh... It’s so fun and freeing... I guess\nI really am best suited to the single life...
Though the truth is that I just made him\na TV dinner because I wanted some time alone!
I have made them too strong.\nThey are beyond my control...
It’s all over now...\nNobody can stop them...
Finally, they calmed down...\nYou’ve saved me. Thank you!
I will test the Pokémon\nyou have been training.
Bah! Is that the best you can do?\nI expected more from you...
Wow! You’re amazing! You’ve\ntrained some great Pokémon!
Take a look at these Pokémon--I raised\n’em myself. They make me right proud.
I am right proud of these Pokémon.\nThey’re my friends and my treasures.
You’re a strong one, sure ’nough.\nBut I don’t plan to lose next time!
I am the top Breeder. I can\ntame any kind of Pokémon.
You see? My Pokémon are\nvery loyal to me, aren’t they?
They are too attached to me.\nThey are not fit for battling.
Monsieur? What’s there to be so sure about?!\nI’m sure I’ll bring you down, that’s for sure!
Argh! I hate being so sure all of the\ntime! I don’t want to be a Monsieur!
Arghh! You! You’ll regret this!\nI will bring you down someday!
My brother told me once...\n“Eyes! Aim for the eyes!”
What my brother told me\nwas right... Thanks, Bro...
I lost against a kid, Bro...\nI should’ve listened to you...
I can’t drop my luxurious lifestyle just\nbecause I’m older. Nothing can stop it.
It may be a hard truth for a child to accept,\nbut money does make the world go round.
I cannot drop the habits I\nlearned when I was young.
I am a late bloomer and a crazy\nbloomer. I’ll bloom and dazzle you!
Dance, blossom, and bloom!\nThis woman flowers in triumph!
I want to fall while still in bloom,\nrather than dying on the branch.
In my country, we say that white can\nhide all manner of sins. Isn’t it great?
But wait--doesn’t that mean wearing white\nmakes it clear you’ve got something to hide?
Oh, forget it! I’m done with fancy clothes!\nI’m ditching this outfit and going to get a tan!
I had no plans for the weekend, so I ended up\nwandering here before I knew what I was about.
The fact that you are so strong... It means\nyou have too much free time, doesn’t it?
Before I knew it, I’d been here for ages.\nBut I’m not lonesome. Of...of course not.

Hi, how are you? I’m Nita!\nIt’s been a long time, Trainer!\c\nYou haven’t forgotten me, right?\c\nI might go mental if you say you\ndid, with how I’ve been waiting!\c\nI know you’re the only Trainer\nworth the challenge, and no guff!\c\nSo let’s get cracking on it!
Eh, that was a savage battle, all right!\nSo what do you think of a serious Nita now?\c\nQuite the change? I hardly know myself!\c\nI know some folks think I’m a bit of a layabout,\nbut I’m one to relish a real challenge.\c\nTo battle a Trainer like you is one for the books!\c\nThe Battle Maison and Nita will always\nbe here and waiting for your visit, lovie!\c\nI’ll even wet the tea, so come on by soon!
Wahey! That was such great fun!\c\nYou really are a strong one, Trainer!\c\nIt’s been a long time since I’ve been\ndefeated like that! So...\c\nI can hardly wait myself for the next\nbattle between us, you bold thing!\c\nThe Battle Maison and Nita will\nalways be here and waiting for your visit!\c\nYou’d better come again--and no guff!
Uh-um...\c\nDo...do you remember me?\nYou don’t...do you...

You’ll excuse us...
Welcome to the Battle Maison!\c\nMy name is Dana. I am the second eldest\nof the four Battle Chatelaine sisters!\c\nLet me introduce my partner for this Multi Battle.\nNita?
Dana: ... ... ...[WAIT 30]\nWe have retained our victory.[WAIT 30]\c\nHowever, I must apologize[WAIT 30]\nto the both of you, I’m afraid.[WAIT 30]\c\nMy sister Nita should not have attacked[WAIT 30]\nyou like that without any warning.[WAIT 30]\c\nSuch behavior reflects poorly on[WAIT 30]\nthe dignity of the Battle Maison.[WAIT 30]\c\nNita! Are you even listening?[WAIT 30]\nApologize to them this instant!
Dana: Nita![WAIT 30]\c\nWe only lost the battle because you went and[WAIT 30]\nstarted it without waiting for me to be ready![WAIT 30]\c\nThe key to any Multi Battle is being[WAIT 30]\nin perfect sync with your partner![WAIT 30]\c\nCan you not get that through[WAIT 30]\nyour thick skull, you moppet?!
Eh, you and your innocent act, Dana!\c\nForget the show! Let’s just get on with it.\nIs this to be a battle or not, eh?\c\nI’m always up for a challenge,\nand I’m ready to start right now!\c\nThere! You’re wide open! I’ll take you down!
Nita: Ah, yer sister! Why should I?[WAIT 30]\nThey’re the ones at fault for being wide open![WAIT 30]\c\nI swear, Dana, you’ll drive me crackers[WAIT 30]\nwith your rules and manners.[WAIT 30]\c\nPokémon battles should be fought as we like,[WAIT 30]\nand who’s to tell us otherwise?[WAIT 30]\c\nAs long as it’s good fun for everyone,[WAIT 30]\nwhere’s the harm?[WAIT 30]\c\nI’ll stake my life that you secretly agree with me.[WAIT 30]\nAnd I’d suppose these two feel the same.[WAIT 30]\c\nThat was a grand battle altogether,[WAIT 30]\nand I hope we can do it again sometime!
Nita: What’s the situation, then? I don’t see[WAIT 30]\nwhy I need to care about that sort of thing![WAIT 30]\c\nAll a battle has to be is cracking good fun![WAIT 30]\c\nBesides that, my real specialty is Single Battle[WAIT 30]\nand has been since year dot![WAIT 30]\c\nWho cares a fig about being in sync?[WAIT 30]\c\nAs for you two, I hope I’ll see each of you[WAIT 30]\nin a Single Battle sometime!
What kind of Pokémon will you be battling with?\nHurry up and show me already, would you?
Well, I lost the battle, but at least I got to see\nsome amazing Pokémon. That’s fine by me!
I sure hope you’ll bring a bit more impressive\nPokémon along for our next battle, OK?

It went just as it always does!\nHahaha! Looks like I win again!
I’d rather battle Pokémon than sleep! I’d even\nrather battle than eat! So come on already!
That’s it! That’s exactly the kind of battle I love!\nYup, that’s what battling you made me feel like.
Come on, pal! Do me a favor and bring some\nstronger Pokémon along next time, won’t you?
You look like you could do some decent battling\nyourself! Hah, this is beginning to look promising!
That was a fantastic attack there!\nLet’s battle one another again someday!
That was no poor show you gave!\nCome challenge me again someday, won’t you?
Hahaha! Come battle against me, my Pokémon,\nand my blindingly beautiful smile!

Ho-how could I lose...\nOoohhh! It’s just so frustrating!
Gwa-ha-ha-ha! You’re about 10 years early\nif you think you can take me on!
OK, here we go! Let’s battle!
Wow, you’re really amazing!\nYou must really love your Pokémon, right?
Pretty pretty please! Give me that victory!
I don’t want to lose anymore!\nNever, ever again!
What is this?!\nAhhhhh! I’m sorry, my Pokémon!
I’m over the moon!!!
This is a team made for winning!\nThey say that honest effort will never betray you!
What... Is this for real?
I’m the one who’s beaten everyone in the nation!
I don’t really know what you want from me,\nbut I just have to battle a bit, right?
There’s, like, no way I could have won against\nsuch a strong opponent. That’s crazy.
Huh? I won? What did I do? What happened?\nI don’t get it. Can you explain?
I’m always serious and ready to go!\nI’m going to go all out again today!
WHAT?! Are you serious?!\nI stayed up all night thinking of that strategy!
See! Everything went just as I expected it to!\nMy calculations were flawless!
C’mon! C’mon! Faster! Let’s go!\nMy Pokémon are chomping at the bit!
What a world! You’re amazing!\nBe my friend, why don’t you?!
I get to fight everyone in the world! I love it!\nThis is what living’s for, pal!
The word that can unite people around the world...\nThat word is “Pokémon”!
Battles all come down to the luck of a moment!\nYou’re amazing for having that luck on your side!
You’ve got to smile whether you win or lose!\nThat’s what it means to be with “Pokémon”!
It doesn’t matter who your opponent is. All you\nneed is the appropriate method, and you will win.
Even with the ideal method, I could not win...\nYour team is nothing short of amazing.
In any pursuit in life, you must fix your eyes on\nyour desired outcome and proceed accordingly.
Aha! Even half-hearted moves are enough to\nbefuddle an opponent!
Aha! A truly strong opponent will not be led\nastray by such moves!
Aha! You seem to have confused yourself\nin your effort to befuddle your opponent.
These competitions are like a wild party, right?\nYou never know what will come at you!
Your battling style is not bad!\nYour Pokémon seemed to have fun, too!
I was just having a good time, but I accidentally\nwent and won. Sorry about that!
What I want is the glory of victory!\nI’m going wrest it away with all my might!
I’m frustrated with all my might!\nI’m not going to forget you!
It was what I wanted with all my might!\nThat’s why I could seize victory for myself!
I only use the coolest moves!\n’Cause I want to win while looking cool!
I guess that just plain winning is cooler than\neven the coolest moves...
Any moves will look cool when we’re the ones\nusing them! Hah!
Every meeting in life is precious, every encounter\nto be cherished. Let’s make our Pokémon happy!
I must use this defeat as fuel for my improvement\nand grow stronger. Let’s meet again!
Win or lose, each battle is a unique experience that\nonly comes once in life. I’m glad we got to battle.

You and I were born\nright here in the same world.
For this one brief life,\nwe’re beneath the same sky.
The great flow of time.\nThe wide expanse of space.
We are lucky enough\nto share this lifetime we get.
We can gain more if we give.\nBy taking, we only lose.
Let us make this a new age\nwhere we show our gratitude.
There’s a fragile bud of hope,\nblooming in each of our hearts.
Don’t you take that away.\nOur dreams are meant to be shared.
Let it grow. Let it live.\nLet us see what it will bring.
When we share in our love,\nwe make a beautiful world.
Search it out, and find the way:\nthe point where we can all meet.
The point where we’re all the same.\nThere it lies: the future we seek.
Start from there, and then we’ll forge\na world where all can be free.
Free to dream, and free to smile.\nFree to be who we will be.
Let’s make sure we create...
A world of our hopes and dreams.
In our brief lives,
we’ve managed to meet.
Treasure this gift...
This precious time that we have.
KISEKI

“Secrets to Super-Training Success:\nAim for bonus goals while you still can!”\c\nThe white goals that appear in front of\nBalloon Bots disappear after one hit, OK?\c\nBut red goals are special bonus goals you\nearn, and they won’t disappear after one hit!\c\nHit ’em again and again and again--until\nthey disappear after a set amount of time!\c\nYou ready for another regimen?\nGood luck!

Watch out! This Balloon Bot will keep firing\nan endless barrage of shots at your Pokémon!\nDo you think you can dodge them all?!
What are those mysterious objects\ncalled “Bitbots” that float around the\nBalloon Bots like that?!
A Balloon Bot that soars up in the sky!\nCalm down and take careful aim if you want\neven a chance to hit this wily target!
A mysterious force seems to be protecting the\nBalloon Bot from any harm...\nWhat is this barrier, and how can you beat it?!
Duck sideways for vertical shots!\nSoar up or down for horizontal ones!\nYou’ve gotta dodge these tricky missiles!
Some shots are headed straight for your\nPokémon--but not all of them!\nCan you tell the difference in time?!
Even the most furious offense follows some\nsort of pattern! Your only chance at victory\nlies in the challenge of finding that pattern!
Can you blast away the Bitbots in your way?\nYou might have to if you want to complete\nthis Super-Training Regimen in time!
If you wanna dodge these high-speed shots,\nyou’ve got to be ready to move the instant the\nBalloon Bot fires ’em! Maybe even before!

What’s with these crazy, changing goals?!\nMemorize the patterns if you hope to hit\nthe next one to appear in time!
Your chance for victory might just betray you!\nWhen you think you’ve got it in the bag is\nexactly when this Balloon Bot shoots back!
Your crisis will become the chance for victory!\nIf you can just make it past the first hurdle,\nyou’ll have a chance to turn this one around!
If you keep a close eye on this Balloon Bot’s\nshots, a flawless victory isn’t out of reach!\nDodge every last shot that comes at you!
Revenge is best served cold, you know!\nThis Balloon Bot is back from the tutorial\nand ready to take back all those points!
Try to accurately hit these constantly moving\ngoals while dodging a merciless barrage of\nshots! Do you think you can do it?!
One wrong step will set you back to zero!\nYou’ll have to avoid every last one of this\nBalloon Bot’s nullifying shots to win!
Secret Super-Training Regimens are the\nlast hurdle for your Pokémon to overcome!\nThe ultimate training for the ultimate Pokémon!
Watch for it! When this Balloon Bot turns its\nback, the shots will fly! Be ready for a barrage\nif you hope to pull through this one!
This Balloon Bot’s arms will slow down right\nafter letting loose a shot--that’s your chance!\nUse the opening to launch your bid for points!
The easiest way to dodge these cross-shaped\nshots is to dodge diagonally! But don’t forget\nthat you can also use a barrier in a pinch!
Can you dodge ’em all?! Watch out for big\nshots, homing shots, and the shots from all\nthose pesky Bitbots--all at once!
Who knew that S.T. could pay so well?!\nThe rewards for this regimen are items that\ncan be sold at a high price to shops!
Take on Balloon Bot after Balloon Bot--and\neach one requires a completely different\nstrategy! Give this one everything you’ve got!

Yeah! I saw the professor buying\nPoké Balls there the other day!
Yeah! I saw the professor talking to the\nlady who works there the other day!
The Skiddo makes the\ncutest noises as it sleeps...
Do you know how many\ncafés there are in this city?
How many cafés have we still\nnot visited in Lumiose City?
I’m not sure, but I know that\nCafé Soleil is next on my list!
Aren’t you curious about that\nplace called Café Cyclone?
Honestly, if you’ve come all this way,\nyou’ve just got to shoot a Trainer PR Video!

No, no, I couldn’t possibly! It’s enough\nfor me just to watch others’ videos!
No, no, I couldn’t possibly! It’s enough\nfor me just to watch others’ videos!
Hey! Did you know that a super-famous\nmovie star sometimes visits Lumiose’s cafés?
Hey! That woman who came to the café the\nother day... Wasn’t that the movie star Diantha?!
I know! I’ve seen her, too!\nOh, I love her movies!
I know! I saw her, too!\nI love Diantha’s movies!
What’s that woman’s name again?\nShe sure is a popular movie star...
I always just remember the names of the\ncharacters, not the movie stars who play them!
She is a beautiful lady, for sure.\nNo wonder she’s so famous!
When you’re recorded for TV like\nthat, you’ll always be young, huh?
The Skiddo looks so\ncomfortable sleeping...
Prism Tower is the very symbol of Lumiose.\nIt can be seen from everywhere in the city.
The only place that you can stand in this city\nand not see Prism Tower is inside the tower!
The napping Skiddo looks so comfy...
The gate has the number 14 carved on it!\nThat way you know what route it leads to.
The gate has the number 14 carved on it!\nThat way you know what route it leads to.
The Skiddo are huddled\ntogether and snoring softly...
Coffee, tea, and then more coffee...\nI could spend my whole day in a café.
Dunking something sweet in your bitter coffee...\nIt’s the best way to enjoy both!
If I had to say, though, I think Striaton\nCity’s tea would be the best in the world.
All of the galettes that I bought as\nsouvenirs were eaten by my Pokémon!
I’d guess it’s already\ntime to say good-bye.
I’m back again already!
Remember, I’m just a\nshort TMV ride away.
...It really is just a\nshort TMV ride away.
So we’re now between Magenta\nPlaza and Estival Avenue...
This stretch between Magenta Plaza and\nEstival Avenue is very stylish, you see.
The blinding rays of the sun watch over\nyour beauty, reflected in my eyes...
The soft caress of the moon washes\nover my beauty, reflected in your eyes...
O-oh, how poetic, darling!\nIt’s so wonderfully romantic!
O-oh, how poetic, darling!\nIt’s so maddeningly lunatic!
I’ve heard that here in Kalos, they don’t\nput ice in your soda! Can you imagine?
People in Kalos kiss each other on the cheek\nto say hello or good-bye. Even if they just met!
Seems like there are more kinds of juice lately, or\nis it that I’ve been hanging in Lumiose City a lot?
Do you think my Fletchling would\nenjoy some premium Berry Juice?
Jui-chiii!
Chi-chi-chi-chiiirp!
In a Double Battle, your Speed stats\nwill become of utmost importance.
In a Double Battle, the real point\nis which Pokémon to attack.
But you could also mix up the order\nin a Double Battle using Fake Out.
But you could also protect your allies\nin a Double Battle using Follow Me.
Dinner sure was good last night...\nI wonder what I’ll have for breakfast.
Breakfast sure was good this morning...\nI wonder what I should have for dinner.
What would you recommend on\nAutumnal Avenue? Hmmmmmm?
Thanks to you, lady, I’ve become\na real master of Autumnal Avenue!
Hee hee hee! I’d say the Poké Ball\nBoutique or the Berry Juice shop!
Oh ho ho! Aren’t you getting ahead of yourself?\nYou haven’t even been to the restaurant yet!
Lysandre loves the color red,\nso he even made his café red.
Lysandre Café’s red décor supposedly\nrepresents the owner’s burning passion!
I’m gonna become even\nbigger than Prism Tower!
Now, now, young man... Why don’t\nyou just start by eating and sleeping well?
Each gulp of coffee reminds me of\nthe Pokémon move Swallow...
The only way to watch the world slowly\nchanging is with a coffee cup in one hand.
What is this blinding aura?!\nIs this what three stars means?!
Maybe I could withstand this overwhelming\naura if I were the Champion or something...
I want to stand atop Prism Tower and\nsee every corner of Lumiose City!
Is it just me or do you seem like you’ve\nalready seen every corner of Lumiose City?
These narrow alleys...\nThey reek of danger...
I heard from someone that there\nare Pokémon in Jaune Plaza.
Whoa! I hear that there’s a Lava\nDome Pokémon in Jaune Plaza!
It’s hard to stand in Jaune Plaza and not\nwant to mimic Pokémon cries, isn’t it?
Hohohoho! It’s hard to stand in Jaune Plaza\nand not want to mimic Pokémon cries, isn’t it?
Gosh, if I could just fish, I could find out\nwhat kind of Pokémon live in the river...
Hey, Trainer! Where’s a fun place\nto go with your Pokémon?
I want to be able to fly around the\nworld freely! Just like a Fletchling!
Wait, you mean the Fletchling in\nLumiose...just walk everywhere?!
This place positively exudes\na stylish atmosphere, doesn’t it?
Oh, isn’t that just like you!\nYou’re already like a Lumiose native!
You can get anywhere in Lumiose\nin no time flat if you use a taxi!
You know Alexa at Lumiose Press...\nDo you figure she’s stronger than Viola?
Snip-snip! ♪ Snippity-snip! ♪\nIt’s a Pokémon salon! ♪
Hey, hey, didja know? Didja know?\nYou can, like, BECOME stylish! Wow!
Another day...  To while away... \nTrimming treasured Furfrou. Yay! 
Yup! You can have your Furfrou’s\nlong hair cut in all kinds of ways!
Y’know... My Emolga wants to\nbe with your Dedenne forever...
Y’know... My Emolga really\nwants to shock your Dedenne.
Mm-hmm...
...What?
Being stylish means knowing all\nabout everything in Lumiose City!
We are swathed in the stylish\naroma of stylish Lumiose City!
We shall go everywhere in Lumiose City,\nand the city will love us for it, darling!
Our promenade through the city has\nimbued us with its stylish fragrance.
I thought we weren’t supposed to\nmeet in Vert Plaza but in Bleu Plaza?
Or maybe it wasn’t Bleu Plaza\nat all but Magenta Plaza?
Is that fool in the\nwrong plaza again?
How many times can he\npossibly get it wrong?
Even after I told him how many times\nit was Vert Plaza and not Bleu Plaza!
Even after I told him how many times that\nit was Vert Plaza and not Magenta Plaza!
I live today for the thrill of trying\nto win the Loto-ID again tomorrow!
Oh, aren’t you a good boy! That’s right!\nWe can only try it once a day!
I like taking a break by roosting\nin the shade of a tree.
I’m so in the know about Lumiose that I\neven know where the best place to rest is.

It’s Sycamore.
Hi, it’s Trevor.
Hello, Holo Caster.
It’s ME! LOOKER! 3
[~ 36]
[~ 37]
Tierno: So, check this out!\c\nI’m out on Route 5 right now, and\nit’s just hopping with wild Pokémon!\r\nHurry and come check it out!\c
Sycamore: Hello there! Looks like you’ve\nalmost made it to Shalour City!\c\nThat’s fantastic! It looks like your journey\nwith your Pokémon around the Kalos region\r\nis going swimmingly!\c\nI wanted to tell you about a person in Shalour\nwho knows a great deal about Mega Evolution.\c\nPeople call him the Mega Evolution guru.\c\nI’ve told everyone else about him, so if you\nhave a second, you should give him a visit!\c
Calem: [VAR TRNAME(0000)], I challenge you to a\nbattle in front of the Gym!\r\nYou’d better be ready!\c
Serena: [VAR TRNAME(0000)]. I challenge you to a\nbattle in front of the Gym!\r\nPrepare yourself!\c
Lysandre: Pokémon Trainers.\nI come to you by the Holo Caster\r\nto make an important announcement.\c\nListen well.\c\nTeam Flare will revive the ultimate weapon,\neliminate everyone who isn’t in our group,\r\nand return the world to a beautiful, natural state.\c\nUnproductive fools are consuming our future...\c\nIf nothing changes, the world will become ugly\nand conflicts will raze the land from end to end.\c\nI repeat. We will use the ultimate weapon\nand wipe the slate clean.\c\nI’m sorry, those of you who are not members\nof Team Flare, but this is adieu to you all.\c
[~ 43]

Calem: [VAR TRNAME(0000)].\c\nThis time, I challenge you to a battle in front of\nAnistar City’s Gym!\r\nYou’d better be ready!\c
Serena: [VAR TRNAME(0000)].\c\nThis time, I challenge you to a battle in front of\nAnistar City’s Gym!\r\nPrepare yourself!\c
Sycamore: Do you have a minute?\c\nI’d like to talk to you face-to-face.\nLet’s meet in Couriway Town!\c
We’re bringing you this special bulletin.\c\nThe Poké Ball Factory in the area\naround Laverre City has been attacked.\c\nThe identities of those involved are unknown.\c\nHowever, this is not expected to have\nany effect on the sales of Poké Balls...\c
Lysandre: Professor Sycamore told me\nyou can now wield Mega Evolution.\c\nThat is truly wonderful.\c\nWith that power, you can steer\nyour future in a better direction!\c\nWe can’t just cover up\nthe old filth with new filth!\c\nI implore you to consider what we\nneed to do to change the world\r\ninto a new, beautiful world!\c
Lysandre: According to Professor Sycamore’s\nresearch, Mega Evolution releases all of a\r\nPokémon’s hidden energy at once.\c\nThe Pokémon then exhibits a level of power it\ncould not attain through ordinary Evolution.\c\nWhat meaning can we draw from this?\c\nDo all people and Pokémon have such potential,\nor is it hidden within a chosen few?\c
Thank you for using the Holo Caster.\c\nLysandre Labs developed the Holo Caster\nto make the lives of Pokémon Trainers\r\nricher, fuller, and more convenient.\c\nWe hope you’ll continue to enjoy the\nfine services this device provides.\c
[~ 53]
Sycamore: Hello there!\c\nI wanted to talk to you for a little bit.\nCould you come to Lysandre Café?\c\nDo you know where it is?\c\nYou can see it from outside the\nPokémon Center right by Prism Tower.\c\nIt’s the red café.\c\nJust hop in a taxi if you can’t find it.\nBe seeing you soon!\c
Trevor: Hello. How have you been?\c\nI just wanted to let you know\nwe’re all going to meet on Route 14.\r\nPlease come and join us.\c
???: Ahem...\c\n[VAR TRNAME(0000)]. Please excuse me.\nI only need a moment. Or perhaps three.\c\nThere is something I really need to talk\nabout with you.\c\nPlease come to the Looker Bureau.\nThe building is close to Rouge Plaza.\c\nI can’t say any more right now.\nI will expect to see you soon.\c
Looker: So now that you’re heading off into\nthe city, [VAR TRNAME(0000)], I just thought I would\r\ngo over the locations of the hidden tickets\r\nonce again.\c\n1. In the Pokémon Center next to Magenta Plaza.\c\n2. In Centrico Plaza, in the tower illuminating\nthe city.\c\n3. On Vernal Avenue, at a shop selling medicines.\c\n4. On North Boulevard, 1F, in a place where\npeople rest.\c\n5. On North Boulevard, 1F, in a place filled with art.\c\nThat’s it.\c\nIf you’re having trouble, return to the\nLooker Bureau or read this message again.\c\nI wish you luck.\c
Looker: [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\nIt is I! Looker!\c\nI want to talk to you about something important!\nCould you come to the Looker Bureau, please?\c
Looker: [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\nI have received a tip from the children.\c\nI judge it most important,\nand it may be of use to you.\c\nMimi apparently doesn’t like\nbeing petted by strangers.\c\nIt is imperative that you check the\nalleys where Mimi is known\r\nto stroll around.\c\nTo be precise:\nAcross from the Galette Stand!\c\nAcross from Lumiose Station!\c\nRight next to Café Triste!\c\nThe entrances to these alleys are\nall found on North Boulevard!\c\nAu revoir and out!\nI wish you luck!\c
Looker: [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\nIt’s me! Looker!\c\nI want to talk to you about something important!\nCould you come to the Looker Bureau, please?\c
Looker: [VAR TRNAME(0000)].\nIt’s me. Looker...\c\nI apologize for the interruption, but could\nyou make haste to the Looker Bureau?\c\nThere’s a bit of a situation.\nI could use your help.\c
Newscaster: We bring you a special bulletin...\c\nLate last night, an intruder broke into the\nLumiose Museum and damaged a painting.\c\nMuseum staff said that security is very tight\nand breaking into the museum is impossible.\c\nThe culprit remains at large.\c
Newscaster: We have another special bulletin.\nPoké Ball thefts are rampant in Lumiose City.\c\nThe thief strikes directly after Pokémon battles,\nwhen Trainers let their guard down.\c\nThese crimes are thought to be the work of a\nsingle individual, but reports on the suspect’s\r\nfeatures vary greatly, so authorities are\r\nstruggling to identify him--or her.\c\nThese crimes are occurring in back alleys and\nin other places where there are few people around.\c\nResidents of Lumiose City should exercise caution.\c
Looker: It’s me! Looker!\n[VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\c\nWould you kindly return to\nthe Looker Bureau posthaste?\c
Looker: OK!\nIt looks like you’ve arrived at the back alley.\c\n[VAR TRNAME(0000)]! Inspect the area!\nThe culprit may be in hiding close by.\c\nI am maintaining a lookout near your position,\nbut use every precaution!\c
Looker: OK!\nLooks like you’ve reached the back alley.\c\n[VAR TRNAME(0000)]! Inspect the area once more!\nThe culprit may be hiding nearby again!\c\nWe’ll wait for an opening,\nand then I’ll rush in, too!\c\nCautiously, [VAR TRNAME(0000)], cautiously...\nClassic precautions never go out of style!\c
Looker: Finally!\nLooks like you’ve reached the back alley!\c\n[VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\nShe’s trapped like a Patrat now!\c\nAccording to our informant,\nthe culprit is a young woman!\c\nShe won’t be able to fool us with\nher clever little transformations!\c\nWe will not let her escape again!\nThis time, we will most certainly catch her!\c\nWe’ll watch for an opening,\nand then I’ll rush in, too!\c\nI’m counting on you, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\c
Looker: OK!\nLooks like you reached the back alley.\c\nBe of good cheer, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\c\nShe may have gotten away from us twice,\nbut THIS time, we’ll get her.\c\nYet I wonder... This miscreant does\nnot seem like an ordinary human being...\c\nIf you get into trouble, call me.\nCertainly! I’ll come running!\c\n[VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\nRemember your precautions!\c
Emma: Um...\nHello? [VAR TRNAME(0000)]?\c\nEr, it’s me...Emma.\c\nI received this Holo Caster thing, so\nI thought I’d try sending a message.\r\nI hope it reaches you.\c\nI have something I want to ask you,\nso please come to the Looker Bureau\r\nwhen you have time.\c
Emma: Hello, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].\nCan you hear me? It’s me, Emma.\c\nI have incredible news for you, so\nplease come to the Looker Bureau!\c
Emma: [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\nI just got a message from Xerosic!\c\nHe’s with Looker at Lysandre Café!\c\nI’m going to take Mimi there!\nHurry over and join us!\c

Maryline: I’m not holding back!\c\nI may only be a Baroness now,\nbut I’m still a Pokémon Trainer!
Maryline: Thank you for letting me show\nmy potential without having to hold back!
Maryline: I don’t hold it against you.\nLosing is part of the game. It’s all about having fun.
Maryline: I enjoyed the battle so much that I’d\nlike you to take this as my thanks.
Estelle: You can only reach the stars if you\nfight for that right. This is why I fight you.
Estelle: Have you already forgotten how I\nsnatched your lucky star away from you?
Estelle: I hope you will go on winning\nand become a shining star of victory.
Estelle: Here. A token of victory for you,\nwho has succeeded in reaching the stars!
Maelys: I have a WONDERFUL feeling about this\nbattle! My heart is fit to burst from my chest!
Maelys: Our battle just now...\nIt left me with a FANTASTIC feeling.
Maelys: I feel like my heart is fit to break...\nThis is the first time I’ve ever felt like this...
Maelys: This is to thank you for helping\nme to experience something new!
Cadette: A graceful maiden and an ancient castle...\nIt’s enough to make a picture, wouldn’t you say?
Cadette: Our battle held a beauty that no picture\ncould properly convey.
Cadette: You were envious of my beauty, weren’t\nyou? It’s all right. I can tell.
Cadette: What a disgrace! So unbecoming!\nTake this, and it will be as if it never happened.
Francine: Wazzat? You wanna tussle? Hah!\nGood times! I’m comin’ at you with all I’ve got!
Francine: Look, I don’t wanna have to break it\nto ya, but losin’ to a mere Baroness like me...\r\nWell, ya ain’t gonna make it too far like that.
Francine: Y-ya totally beat me...\nYou’re pretty tough for such a cute little thing!
Francine: All righty then!\c\nI guess I’ll just have to give ya a treasure that’s\nbeen passed down in my family for generations!
Evran: Are you new around here?\c\nI mean, why else would you dare to\nbattle someone like me, said to be\r\nthe next Viscount in the making?
Evran: You’ve lost. And do you know\nwhy? Because you don’t know your place.
Evran: Hmph... So you are more capable\nthan your plebeian looks would suggest.\c\nIf you continue winning battles like this, I\nexpect your rank in the nobility to increase.
Evran: Even if it was a near miracle, you did\nmanage to beat me--so take this.
Marseille: Money is no object when\nit comes to getting what I desire.\c\nI can get any Pokémon I want if\nI throw enough money around!
Marseille: Would you look at that?\nYou’ve lost to me, now haven’t you?\c\nDon’t fret. You never stood a chance\nagainst my money’s power.
Marseille: This is...unprecedented...\nCould it be I didn’t use enough money?\r\nOr could...I actually be the problem?
Marseille: Well, that’s rather impressive!\nI have the perfect job for you. I’ll let\r\nyou be my bodyguard, my personal servant.\r\nHow about this for your compensation?
Lyon: I shall do this all myself so that no\none can say I used my parents’ influence!
Lyon: It is frustrating, isn’t it? I know all\ntoo well! So you must try to win for yourself!
Lyon: I cannot blame others for my\nfailures! I said I would do this myself!
Lyon: I will be coming here again\nso I can see it through for myself!\c\nHere! I want you to take this, Trainer,\nso you will remember me for myself!
Orvault: Heh-heh-heh...\c\nA first-class gentleman has\nto have first-class Pokémon!
Orvault: It’s hardly any wonder, was it?\c\nAfter all, you were battling first-class\nPokémon...and a first-class gentleman.
Orvault: Heh-heh-heh...\c\nA first-class gentleman isn’t\nruffled by a little loss like this.
Orvault: I really am just a\nfirst-class gentleman, aren’t I?\c\nThat’s why I have no problem\nrewarding you for winning.
Herisson: This is my debut in society!\nI have been dreaming of this day!\c\nI may be just a Baron, but I am going\nto latch on to some nice Duchess and\r\nAqua Jet myself to the top of society!
Herisson: Beating you will definitely\nhelp boost my status in society!\c\nI’m going to keep speeding ahead\nlike a swift Quick Attack to the head!
Herisson: Look, since I lost and\nall, I’m gonna level with you, pal.\r\nI’m actually super, crazy poor.\r\nLike poorer-than-dirt poor, see?\c\nBut I’m gonna raise my rank here\nand use a mean Revenge on life!
Herisson: Now, you be sure to use an\nIllusion and hide the truth about me.\r\nYou will, right? This’ll be your reward.
Moray: What’s this? It seems as\nthough a commoner has gotten in.
Moray: In the end, a commoner just\ndoesn’t have what it takes, hmm?
Moray: How fortunate you are!\nThis arena is only for the chosen,\r\nand you seem to be one of us.\c\nIf you raise your rank, you will be\nable to battle more and stronger\r\nTrainers. Don’t you feel honored?
Moray: To think you would be worthy...\nDo forgive my earlier assumptions...\r\nI’ll give you this token as an apology.
Renée: I want the kind of thrilling\nexcitement that money can’t buy!
Renée: That was terrible! There was\nnothing thrilling or exciting about you.
Renée: Ohhh, what a thrill!\nFrom you and your Pokémon!
Renée: Heh-heh...I feel completely\nsatisfied. Here, don’t be shy. Take it.
Denis: Friend, lend me your ear!\c\nFor I am the great Denis, envy of\nall, holder of the lofty rank of Baron!\c\nOne word alone appears not in my\nmighty lexicon! That word is “defeat”!
Denis: Bwahahaha! It was ’cause\nI sounded so impressive, right?
Denis: Truth is, I’m really\nnot all that strong a Trainer.\r\nBut I sounded cool, right?
Denis: Bwahahahaha!\nNow it’s time to say adieu!\r\nHere’s a parting gift!
Camille: Defeating a simple servant should pose\nyou no problem. Or you might as well go home!
Camille: I tried to give you the benefit of the doubt.\nBut with someone so weak, even that’s pointless.
Camille: Of course, it’s only to be expected that\nyou would defeat a mere servant like me.\c\nIf you show yourself capable of doing the same to\nmore suitable opponents, your rank will grow faster.
Camille: This is a gift I was\ngiven by my own employer...\r\nTake it with my compliments.
Danielle: Oh my, that is quite the\nunusual style you are sporting there.\c\nDid you pick out your clothes in the\ndark? Or perhaps from a trash can?
Danielle: Oooh, well, wasn’t that embarrassing...\nBut I suppose someone so hopeless in terms of\r\npersonal grooming must also be rubbish at battle.
Danielle: I-it’s just because of your\nhideous style, I’ll have you know!\r\nI was distracted by its terribleness!
Danielle: Look, I’ll give you this, all right?\nSo just leave already and spare my eyes!
Anne-Laure: It’s, like, so difficult having\nway too much of everything, y’know?
Anne-Laure: You would not believe what\na pain it is to keep winning all the time.
Anne-Laure: Look, I’m being serious here...\c\nWhat happiness is there in life other than\nmoney? Do you know? Can you tell me?
Anne-Laure: It’s heavy carrying all this great\nstuff around. Could you take this off me?
Beatrice: Let’s get started at once!\nI’ve been chomping at the bit!
Beatrice: Hurry up and raise your rank\nso you can come back and serve me\r\nup a real good trouncing, would ya?
Beatrice: Going wild with my Pokémon\nis the ultimate stress relief for me!
Beatrice: That was awesome!\nTake this from me!
Gourdon: Rich Boys definitely run\nthe gamut, from superb to dismal.\c\nBeing a Viscount like me is just the\nsort of pedigree my birth demands.
Gourdon: Did you hold back\nin awe of my superior birth?
Gourdon: ... ... ...\n... ... ...\c\nYou know, the weight of all my\nglorious forefathers’ honor...\r\ngets pretty heavy sometimes...
Gourdon: I may have lost, but you\ncan’t tell my family, you got that?\r\nJust take this and be off with you...
Braine: That’s right! This is it!\nThis is the highlight of your life!\c\nBecause I am just as blindingly,\nfantastically famous as I look!
Braine: Oh! Speaking of famous!\c\nDid you know Gym Leaders are\nsaid to show up here sometimes?
Braine: Even if a star loses...\nit doesn’t lose any of its shine.\c\nDoes it?
Braine: Yes, the brilliance of a star...\nI guess I’ll give you a little piece of it!
Herault: Krmph! Bwahaha!\c\nYou seriously think that you\ncan beat a Viscount like me?\r\nYou’re too funny, you know?
Herault: Krmph! Bwahaha!\n’Cause I’m pretty good, y’see!
Herault: Sniffle...\nI-I’m going home...\c\nMaman will make it\nall better for me...
Herault: S-stop right there!\nDon’t you dare come closer!\c\nI’ll give you this, s-so just...\nleave me alone, would you?!
Ardmore: Hmm.\nI don’t want any pretty words.\r\nJust show me what you’ve got.
Ardmore: You did well...
Ardmore: You don’t need any\nwords from a loser like me...
Ardmore: Hmm. This is for you...
Ayla: Come at me, Trainer!\nYou should know there can be no holding\r\nback in a battle against a Viscountess! ♪
Ayla: A Viscountess like me\nis always ready for action! ♪
Ayla: I thought you were just another\ncommoner, but you’re quite strong!\r\nTo be honest, I never expected that! ♪
Ayla: I’ll give you this from me.\nI’m sure it’ll be perfect for you! ♪
Mathilde: Listen up, young Trainer.\nBattling a Viscountess is different.\r\nMore different than night and day.\r\nMore different than I can even say.
Mathilde: You have good potential.\nYou’d better give it all you’ve got.
Mathilde: You’ll be even stronger.\nI guarantee it. Just you wait and see.
Mathilde: A farewell gift.\nJust take it, no complaints!
Regine: It’s the same for both\nPokémon and fashion brands...\c\nThey can’t settle for being strong.\nThey have to look good, too.
Regine: Do you understand\nthe power of brands now?
Regine: Strength and beauty...\nPut them together, and you have\r\nthe makings of a real luxury brand...
Regine: Here. Take this to\nmemorialize a beautiful win.
Cullinan: I may be a master businessman, but I\nknow nothing about Pokémon.
Cullinan: Were you taking things easy\non me, perhaps?
Cullinan: What could I be doing wrong?\nIf there’s some trick to it, do teach me.
Cullinan: I’ll dash away the pain of losing with an\nexcess of riches!
Tolkowsky: Win! Win! Win! WIN!\nYou’ve gotta say it to believe it!
Tolkowsky: You’ve just gotta speak up!\nI’m sure you could’ve won if you did!
Tolkowsky: Wheeze...\nM-my vision...is going black...\r\nMaybe I shouted too much...\c\nPerhaps this is also an effect\nof that red Writ of Challenge\r\nthat I received before...
Tolkowsky: Now I’ve learned, though...\nShouting won’t get you anywhere.\r\nHere! To thank you for this lesson!
Orloff: Hehehe. You there! Young’un!\c\nYou’d better drink deep of the strong-brewed\ndandyism you can only get from a dried-up old\r\nman like me! Hehehe!
Orloff: Did you get a good taste?\nThat’s the real depth and bite of my dandyism\r\nthat oozes from every pore!
Orloff: The hunched shoulders\nof a man defeated in battle...\c\nThis is man’s true pathos.\nThis truly is dandyism.
Orloff: Here, I’ll give you this!\nI hope it will bring you one step closer to true\r\ndandyism, my child!
Julia: Vrrrrr...\nTARGET...ACQUIRED.\r\nCOMMENCING ATTACK.
Julia: THIS DEVICE IS NOW IN SLEEP MODE.\c\nYOU MAY LEAVE A BRIEF MESSAGE AFTER\nTHE BEEP...
Julia: I WAS CREATED\nSOLELY TO DO BATTLE...
Julia: THIS IS A PART OF ME\nBROKEN IN OUR BATTLE...\r\nYOU SHOULD TAKE IT...
Anita: Wazzat?\nYou wanna stand up to me?\c\nThen ya’d better show me a\npower worthy of a Countess!
Anita: Tsk. What was that?\nNot even worth talkin’ about...\c\nI feel like I oughta put your\nPokémon outta their misery...
Anita: To beat someone like me...\nYou ain’t no ordinary Trainer, kid...
Anita: Here, I’ll give ya a reward.\nPick it up. ...I SAID pick it up!
Royan: I am a royal, and I also\nbear the title of Earl in this hall.\c\nMaking an effort and sweating...\nSuch things do not become me.
Royan: This was the only way\nit could end. Do not blame me.
Royan: A royal member of the\nranked nobility such as myself...\r\nmust retain his pride and dignity.\r\nI accept loss with grace and poise.
Royan: Take this with you,\nand be gone from my sight.
Glen: It matters not if you are young.\nI will show no mercy to you in battle!
Glen: Never holding back.\nThat is how battle should be.
Glen: Even though you were\nyoung, I did not hold back.
Glen: A loss is a loss...\nTake this, won’t you?
Mira: I have always wanted to be\nrich, ever since I was a small child.\r\nSo I worked to become a Countess\r\nbecause wealth gets you respect.
Mira: Sigh...\nWhat is true happiness anyway?
Mira: In the end, what I truly\nfound was only the wealth...\r\nRespect is won, not bought.
Mira: Being surrounded by money\nseemed like such a joy back then.\c\nBut when you reach my age, it all\nseems so empty and meaningless...
Eliane: There comes a time in life when gems\ncease to sparkle and gold loses its allure.\c\nBut...my next life is soon enough for that.\nToday, bring on the bling!
Eliane: If you stick it out here,\nyou can make a pretty penny.
Eliane: I want to live to the end of my\nlife without worrying about money!\c\nThat’s why I send countless numbers of\ngold Writs of Invitation--to bring in cash!
Eliane: The truth is that I hate to\ngive away so much as a penny.\c\nBut I guess we privileged folk are obliged\nto give to charity from time to time.
Patricia: I have something good to say:\nbeing bored is a crime! You got that?!\c\nSo you and your Pokémon better be\nsure that I enjoy this battle to the max!
Patricia: You won’t be reaching\nany of the higher ranks like that!\c\nIf you want to battle me again, you’d\nbetter go do some training, I guess!
Patricia: You’re really good!\c\nI could use some full-time training...\nSo how about I adopt you?\r\nYou’d be my darling grandchild!
Patricia: Well, it was fun while\nit lasted. Don’t you forget me...
Edith: Now, I want you to listen to me...\nThe Pokémon I am about to use were\r\nleft to me by my dearly departed husband.
Edith: Even if my husband is gone,\nhaving his Pokémon here with me is...
Edith: My darling husband... Yes, he was\na Swimmer ♂ with the body of an athlete...
Edith: Oh, darling...\nLook how happy your Pokémon are now!\r\nHere, child, I will give you this in thanks.
Adele: Ohoho... It’s been 70 years\nsince I came squalling into this world.\r\nIt has been a long journey to this day.
Adele: Ohohoho... You have to\nturn crisis into an opportunity.
Adele: Ohoho... You have to work while\nyou are still so young and cute.\r\nAnd not concern yourself with rewards.
Adele: Ohoho, that’s what I said, but...\c\nI’ll reward you this one time, with the hope\nthat you will continue to be successful.
Lesotho: M-Monsieur!\nMonsieur for sure!
Lesotho: M-Monsieur!\nMonsier du jour!
Lesotho: M-Monsieur...\nMonsieur...premature...
Lesotho: Monsieur!\nMonsieur, endure!
Gruosi: I have slithered my way up from the dregs\nof society to where I am now.\c\nI will not lose to anyone, whether it comes to the\nstrength of my heart or my body!
Gruosi: Raise your head, young one...\nLife is battle. There’s no changing that.\c\nThat is why you should raise your rank.\nAll you need to do is work your way up...
Gruosi: That’s right...\nI overcame my past in the gutters.\r\nThat is how I became this Gruosi...\r\nStanding before you as an Earl...
Gruosi: I’ll give you this...\nUse it when things get tough.
Nassak: Crikey, you know everyone\nseems to think the rich have no troubles...\r\nThat’s a filthy, mean lie right there, it is!
Nassak: I mean, of course, we’ve got trouble!\nPeople always asking for handouts...\r\nWorking hard to evade taxes...\r\nIt’s hard being rich!
Nassak: See? I have plenty of troubles. Can’t\neven win a battle!\r\nWinning is as impossible for me as...as...as being\r\nrich is for you!
Nassak: Oh, fine! Blast it all!\nYou’re gonna be something big!\c\nHere. I’ll just have to consider it an investment for\nthe future!
Sancy: Thank you for visiting!\nHow ya doin’, pal? Doin’ good?\c\nMoney sure makes the world go ’round!\nNot just Pokémon, no!
Sancy: Scram. Get outta my face.\nI got nothing to say to a weakling.
Sancy: If you’re this strong, you oughta be able to\nstrike it rich, kid!
Sancy: Gwahahahaha!\nI like you, kid. I really do!\c\nEven if I ain’t what I was, I’m still an Earl, so...\nHere! Just take it, wouldja?!
Nizam: And so he appears...\nThe man with the ultimate Pokémon.
Nizam: Yes... My Pokémon...\nThey truly are the ultimate, aren’t they?
Nizam: The truth is, I knew it...\c\nLooks alone don’t mean anything.\nAnd what’s inside means even less.
Nizam: Guess I don’t have much choice.\nI’ll give you this...
Ida: I’m great at cleaning!\c\nI’m going to dispose of you\nlike a stinky bag of trash!
Ida: Oh my... How does it\nfeel to be kicked to the curb?
Ida: Well, this is troubling...\nA Maid who can’t clean up might\r\nget thrown out like yesterday’s trash...
Ida: Let’s keep the results of the battle\njust now between the two of us, OK?
Alyssa: I apologize for the wait, but you have\nfinally reached me: the Pinnacle of Princesses,\r\nthe one recognized as the Leader of All Ladies!
Alyssa: Would you like to battle\nme again on another occasion?\c\nIf you dream of such an honor,\nperhaps wish on a shooting star.
Alyssa: Yet I am the one who is\nsaid to be the pinnacle of Ladies...\c\nPerhaps it is time for me to consider\nadvancing from Lady to Madame Alyssa?
Alyssa: Are you paying attention?\nThis is a gift from the very Lady\r\namong Ladies. Take it with care...
Caen: I see... Then so be it.\c\nCome at me, prole. Everything I do,\nI do to become a great ruler someday.
Caen: ...Are you also\nperhaps seeking power?
Caen: Just you watch, you lowly prole...\nThe day will come when I rule the world!
Caen: Bwahahahahaha!\nIt was only for an instant, but I shall\r\npraise you for inspiring fear in me.\c\nThe next time you wish to fight, I suggest\nyou send a red Writ of Challenge.\c\nIf you wish to see my true power,\nthat is! Bwahahahahahaha!
Arran: ... ... ...\nIt is my master’s orders.\r\nPlease forgive me for\r\nwhat I am about to do...
Arran: The master’s orders\nare absolute, you see...
Arran: I shall not say...\nI shall never reveal...\r\nmy master’s identity...
Arran: ... ... ...\nI cannot reveal that, but...\r\nI quite like you. So, here...
Amandine: Feel it... Feel it with your\neyes, ears, mouth, skin, breath...\c\nBreathe in the feeling of battle with a\ngreat Marchioness like me...
Amandine: You lack experience.\c\nIt is not just enough to flail about with your body!\nYou must train your spirit, as well!
Amandine: Every sport is a battle\nbetween victory and defeat...\c\nBut there is no winner or loser\nin the arena of Pokémon battle.\c\nIt is instead a sublime experience\nthat can move body and soul...
Amandine: Hohoho...\nFor your sublime battle.
Grisognono: Did you know?\nI’m a Marquis. Yes, I am!\c\nI’m super elite and stuff!\nLet’s see what you’ve got!
Grisognono: Ehh, don’t mind it!\nHere, this should cheer you up:\c\nsome opponents you can never beat, but no rain\ncan fall forever!
Grisognono: That was great!\nI may have lost, sure, but that was the kind of\r\nbattle that leaves you feeling as light as the clear\r\nsky overhead!
Grisognono: Phew! I dunno, but I think I like you,\nkid! Take this with you, yeah?
Amelie: Hey, you! Yeah, I’m talking to you!\nYou lookin’ down on me ’cause I’m a Maid?\c\nHere in this Battle Chateau, I’m a Marchioness!\nHow d’you like that? I’mma destroy you!
Amelie: Even Maids can\nfight. Don’t you forget it!
Amelie: Oh, er, sorry about that...\c\nI’m afraid that I tend to get a bit\ntoo free with my words when I am\r\ncaught up in the heat of battle...
Amelie: Gosh, that was so much fun! \nAnd here, this is for you! Tee-hee! 
Yolande: You know, recently I don’t\nlike to wear anything that wasn’t\r\ntailor-made specifically for me.
Yolande: But the truth is, I’m\nbored with just looking good.\r\nIn the end, it’s battling, isn’t it?\r\nBattle is definitely the most fun.
Yolande: Huh? What’s that? You want\nto know how much my furisode is worth?\r\nI’d say about 200 Big Nuggets, why?
Yolande: Oh yeah, my boyfriend\ngave me this, but it’s so gauche.\r\nSo I’ll just give it to you instead.
Meriel: If you’re not strong around here,\nthen no one will recognize you, right?\c\nSo then what happens to the weaklings?\nDo they not have any value at all to us?
Meriel: What is the true value\nof being a Trainer, I wonder.
Meriel: I don’t know, but...\nI don’t think it’s all up to strength.\c\nNot the value of a Trainer, nor the\nvalue of his or her Pokémon either.
Meriel: I guess I don’t really\ncare about being recognized.\c\nI had fun, and that’s all that\nmatters to me, so here...
Keira: I can feel it...\nYou are...very strong...
Keira: All of the people here...\nThey are all...very strong...
Keira: Both you...and your Pokémon...\nSo strong... So...wonderful...
Keira: Since you’re strong...\nI will give you...this...
Fiona: To envelop and conceal\nmy lovely body from others...\c\nAgain, I cloak myself with\nthis trifling, transient garment...
Fiona: This furisode is the armor\nthat hides my true form from all.
Fiona: The bulging muscles that\nspread beneath this furisode...\c\nYes, in truth, I am a bodybuilder.\nMy body, a tapestry of muscles.
Fiona: I shall give you this,\nin the name of all muscles...
Even as a Marchioness, I’m still\nalways looking for the perfect shot.\c\nAnd the quickest way to the perfect\nshot is by capturing the perfect win!
The photo from the moment of my\nvictory will be a real winner, all right!
I knew that you and your Pokémon could\nshow me a whole new depth of field!
Here! Another bit of gear\nfor such a perfect shot!
There is only one thing I wish for.\c\nThat by surpassing one another, we\nfind a way to even greater heights.
Do not give up. That is all there really is to it.\nThe most important lessons in life are simple.
Yes, this is the way it should be. This way\nboth humans and Pokémon will grow.
To commemorate such an impressive\nshow of teamwork, please accept this gift!
Time for Lady Korrina’s big appearance!
If I want to be able to use Mega Evolution\nright, I’ve gotta keep raising my own level!
Oh! Defeat!\nAlack, alay!
Oh well, I can roll with the punches.\nTake this. I award it to you, [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0908)]good sirfair lady.
So yer back for more, whippersnapper!\c\nI know I’ll enjoy another Pokémon battle\nwith yeh, sprout, sure as trees grow up!
Hohoho... Indeed. Frail little blades o’\ngrass’ll break through even concrete.
Yeh believe in yer Pokémon...\nAnd they believe in yeh, too...\r\nIt was a fine battle, sprout.
Go on, then. Take it.\nYeh’ve earned it.
Oh! I’m glad that we got\nto meet again like this.
It looks like the machine that I made\nfor helping a Trainer grow stronger\r\nhas really paid off in spades! Brilliant!
I’m glad whenever I get to learn\nfrom other strong challengers.\r\nThank you for the battle!
The future is now, thanks to science!\c\nPower on, my precious gift-giving machine!
Oh, if it isn’t my young Trainer...\nIt is lovely to get to meet you again like this.\c\nThen I suppose you have earned yourself the\nright to a battle, as a reward for your efforts.\c\nThe elusive Fairy may appear frail as the breeze\nand delicate as a bloom, but it is strong.
Oh goodness, what a pity...
That was truly a captivating battle.\nI might just be captivated by you.
I hope you will accept this gift from me...\c\nPlease consider it as a personal gift from\nme, not simply the winnings of a battle.
An ancient custom\ndeciding one’s destiny.\c\nThe battle begins!
Peace steals over me.\c\nDefeating the strong gives birth\nto a restful heart.
Winner and loser.\c\nA winged Pokémon leads on,\nto the goal of both.
Proof of my defeat.\c\nYour great victory made real.\nThat is what I give.
You know what?\c\nWe all talk big about what you learn\nfrom battling and bonds and all that,\r\nbut really, I just do it ’cause it’s fun.\c\nWho cares about the grandstanding?\nLet’s get to battling!
You know what?\c\nI believe I have shown you the extreme\nawesomeness and strength of ice.
You know what?\c\nYour Pokémon really threw everything\nthey had into that battle just now.\r\nYou really are something, you know?
Here, you know, it’s a\nlittle gift. Just take it.

Do not give up. That is all there really is to it.\nThe most important lessons in life are simple.
Yes, this is the way it should be. This way\nboth humans and Pokémon will grow.

Here, you know, it’s a\nlittle gift. Just take it.
Robin: Oh! I’ve heard about you, of course.\nHeh heh, I’ve been looking forward to this.\c\nI wonder how you will perform in a battle\nagainst a masterful Duchess like me.
Robin: Don’t worry, you were good.\nJust not as good as the rumors say.
Robin: You are even better\nthan the rumors suggest.\c\nTo have battled this far\nwith such ability as this...\c\nYes, you are the real thing.\nIn all senses of the word.
Robin: I’d like to see you again.\c\nSo I hope you will keep battling\nhere forever, as I certainly will!
Lormont: I could wreck a battle!\nSure, it’s thanks to battling with\r\nmy Pokémon that I’ve made it here!
Lormont: You soft in the head or something?\nHow’re you going to keep winning like that?
Lormont: Ohh, now you’re in for it!\c\nYou’ve got some fierce, strong Pokémon,\nbut don’t think I’ll keep losing like this!
Lormont: Bwahahaha!\nNaw, but you’re pretty good!\r\nI want to give you this for a reward, so I will!
Turner: You know, I have been thinking...\c\nThe ties between a Butler and his master\nare quite like a Pokémon and its Trainer.
Turner: How unfortunate...\c\nAre your Pokémon perhaps\ndefying your leadership?
Turner: Yes, this is as it should be...\c\nJust as a Butler will function most\neffectively for a great human master.
Turner: Here, this is for you...\c\nIt was a reward from my own\nmaster, but I cannot use it...
Odele: Perhaps it seems dull to you\nto battle an old woman, but think about this...\c\nAge notwithstanding, I am a Duchess.\nWill you favor me with a battle?
Odele: Were you so bored battling an old woman\nthat you let your guard down?
Odele: Yes, hmm. I have almost everything\na person could wish for in life, and yet...\c\nIt seems the only way I can lighten my\nboredom and loneliness is through battle.
Odele: If I had been blessed with a grandchild,\nI wonder if [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0100)]she might have turned out like you.\c\nWon’t you take this little something from me?\nJust do it to humor an old woman, won’t you?
Hennessy: Is it fate or is it our nature?\c\nIt seems as though we Trainers will never\ntire of seeking battle, no matter our ages...
Hennessy: I wished to better understand\nwhat qualities a true Trainer should have.\r\nThat is why I began hosting this contest.
Hennessy: I have done nothing but\nbattle since I was a very young man.\c\nBefore I knew it, I had become this\ngraying old man you see before you.\c\nAnd yet I still feel that I can go so\nmuch further as a Trainer...
Hennessy: Hmm. I expected no less.\c\nI knew the moment I met you that\nyou would be worthy of our ranks.\c\nI feel grateful once again for having\nthis chance. Please do take this...
Elise: With my skills, no one can best me.\nI have my master wrapped around my finger.\c\nYes, every penny he has will eventually\nplunk straight into my little pocket...
Elise: I will succeed, no matter what.\nAnd what will you do with your life?
Elise: I was born miserably poor.\c\nBut rather than curse my birth,\nI am going to seize success for\r\nmyself, no matter what it takes.\c\nThat’s why I use my master and\nwhy I use places like this.
Elise: Please don’t get in\nthe way of my success...\c\nI’ll give you this in return.
Rosalie: It all just seems way too tragic...\c\nThe flowers in bloom will someday wilt and fall.\nThis lovely girl will become an old lady...
Rosalie: Yes, that is youth...\nIt passes before you’ve even\r\nnoticed its expiration date...
Rosalie: So you keep on working hard and\nyou keep on getting older and you keep on\r\nsaving till you accumulate modest riches...\c\nBut then how are you going to use your\nmoney then, let alone really enjoy it?\c\nIf that’s the case, isn’t it better to live in\nthe now, with all the brilliance of a short-\r\nlived cherry blossom just waiting to fall?
Rosalie: Here, a gift just for you\nfrom a tragically beautiful girl...\r\nSo won’t you tell me how to live?
Ione: The Pokémon on my team are a\nbit different from what you’ve got there.\c\nI paid the very top Pokémon Breeders\npiles of money to raise these lovelies.
Ione: What are your thoughts on this matter?\nI am certain we agree that Pokémon raised by\r\npros are on a different level from the rabble.
Ione: Ughhh.\c\nMaybe you really do have to\nraise your Pokémon yourself.
Ione: Here, I’ll give you this.\c\nI’m nearly out of money after paying such\nridiculous fees to all those Breeders!
Sabine: Um, you know, even though\nI’m dressed so fashionable like this...\r\nWell, I am still a Duchess, you know?\r\nI’m super strong. Better watch out!
Sabine: Um, you know, I think that\nyou’re probably not really that weak.
Sabine: You know, my mom and\nmy dad are both super strong, so\r\nI guess that’s why I’m strong, too.
Sabine: But, seriously, you know,\nI’ll give you this, OK? So take it.
Nicolette: Wahahaha! Brilliant!\nI’ve been waiting AGES for this!\r\nLet’s battle till we’re fit to burst!
Nicolette: Wahahaha!\nLet’s battle again sometime!
Nicolette: Shame on you!\nThat wasn’t nearly enough to burst!
Nicolette: Hey, check this out! I’m giving\nit to you, so let’s battle again sometime!
Well met, young challenger!\c\nVerily am I the famed blade of\nhardened steel, [VAR COLOR(0001)]Duke Wikstrom[VAR COLOR(0000)]!\c\nLet the battle begin! En garde!
What manner of magic is this? My heart,\nit doth hammer ceaselessly in my breast!\c\nWinning against such a worthy opponent\ndoth give my soul wings--thus do I soar!
What manner of disaster be this? My heart,\nit doth hammer ceaselessly in my breast!\c\nAt last do I understand that sweet torture,\nthat perfect balance of joy and frustration!
Do accept this token of my regard.\c\nLong has this treasure been held by\nthe esteemed knights of my family...\c\nVerily has it been our most treasured\npossession, since I happened to pick it up\r\nin a shop a week ago. Or two weeks, mayhap!\c\nMay it serve you well.
I am the [VAR COLOR(0001)]Duchess Malva[VAR COLOR(0000)], and I\nshall be your opponent today.
I am delighted! Yes, delighted that I\ncould squash you beneath my heel!
Oooh, you wicked little Trainer, you!\nI will definitely remember this battle!
Take this with you when you go.\nI selected it particularly for you.
Oh goodness, hello to you!\nI’m so glad you’ve joined us!\c\nI know that you’re very strong.\nThat will make this great fun!
How can this be?
Oh, you! You’re too much!\nYou and your Pokémon are simply charming!
And, my word, wouldn’t this just go\nwonderfully with your look? Do try it!
... ... ...\nYes, I see it now.\c\nThis is a path with no end. To seek to\nbe the absolute best is an absurd goal.\c\nYet, as long as I am alive, I shall strive\nonward to seek the ultimate cuisine...\r\nand the strongest opponents in battle!
Our Pokémon battle was like food\nfor my soul. It shall keep me going.\c\nThat is how I will pay my respects\nto you for giving your all in battle!
No! This result will not satisfy my\nhunger--my aching thirst for victory!\c\nHowever, when I look at it from a\ndifferent perspective, I must admit\r\nthat your way of living is fantastic...
Take this gift with you on your way.\c\nAnd strive always to find the meaning\nin everything that happens to you.
Oh my!\c\nI never thought I would meet\nyou here! Honestly, I didn’t!\c\nOh, but--silly me--I should at\nleast do these things right...\c\nAs Champion and as\nGrand Duchess of the Battle Chateau,\r\nI, Diantha, challenge you.
Oh, fantastic! What did you think?\nMy team was pretty cool, right?\c\nIt’s a bit embarrassing to show off,\nbut I love to show their best sides!
I just...I just don’t know what to say...\nI can hardly express this feeling...\c\nBut I’m so glad that I got to be\nChampion and Grand Duchess...\c\nBattling you and your Pokémon\nmakes everything seem worth it!
Hehe, here you go!\nI hope you like it!

Welcome to the Battle Chateau, my good sir.\c\nHow might I be able to assist you on this fine\nday, [VAR COLOR(0001)]Baron [VAR TRNAME(0000)][VAR COLOR(0000)]?
Of course. It would be my pleasure to explain.\c\nFrom this reception, you will find yourself able to\nissue a Writ of Invitation to the other Trainers who\r\nfrequent our humble Battle Chateau.\c\nYou will discover that there are some differences in\nthe types of Trainers that will respond to your Writ,\r\ndepending on its variety.\c\nIt is my duty to inform you, however, that we do\nask for a slight compensation for this service.
I would be delighted to assist you.\nWhich Writ of Invitation would you like issued?
If we issue this Writ of Invitation, other Trainers\nwill come to patronize our fair Battle Chateau with\r\ngreater frequency than they usually do.\c\nIn return for this service, we would ask you to pay\nthe modest fee of $[VAR NUM6(0004,002C)].\c\nAre these terms agreeable to you?

If we issue this Writ of Challenge on your behalf,\nyou will find that rather more motivated Trainers\r\nwill come to patronize our fair Battle Chateau.\c\nIn return for this service, we would ask you to pay\nthe modest fee of $[VAR NUM6(0004,002C)].\c\nAre these terms agreeable to you?
If we issue this blue Writ of Challenge on your\nbehalf, you can expect rather more sedate and\r\nserene battles with your fellow Trainers than you\r\nmight usually experience.\c\nIn return for this service, we ask you to pay\nthe modest fee of $[VAR NUM6(0004,002C)].\c\nAre these terms agreeable to you?
If we issue this red Writ of Challenge on your\nbehalf, you will experience fierce and competitive\r\nbattles that go beyond your usual milieu.\c\nIn return for this service, we ask you to pay\nthe modest fee of $[VAR NUM6(0004,002C)].\c\nAre these terms agreeable to you?
Very good. Then I will issue this Writ at once.

If there is anything else that I can possibly help\nyou with, please do not hesitate to call on me.
If we issue this black Writ of Challenge on your\nbehalf, it will draw the most competitive and\r\nmost competent of opponents to you.\c\nIn return for this service, we would ask you to pay\nthe modest fee of $[VAR NUM6(0004,002C)].\c\nAre these terms agreeable to you?
