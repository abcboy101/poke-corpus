Advanced Tips!\c\nYou can cast a fishing line from a Pokémon’s back\nwhen using Surf to move across the water!
Do you have the Mega Ring?\nIs that what this stone is reacting to?\c\nI see...\nThen you should take this with you.
If Korrina and the Mega Evolution guru have\nrecognized your skill as a Pokémon Trainer,\r\nI’m sure you can master the power of your bond\r\nwith your Pokémon and that Mega Stone.

Welcome to\nHotel Ambrette.
Hey, I got something rare\nfrom a customer!\c\nI had a chat with the customer\nseveral times, and we hit it off!
Ouaf!
Tee-hee!
Traveling Trainer!\nWhy don’t you use this?
Nature Power becomes a different move\ndepending on the place it’s used.\r\nI hope it will add fun to your journey!

Hi! Guess what!\c\nI heard that some Pokémon can evolve\nduring a battle! Did you know that?
There are lots of stones that can bring out\nnew power in Pokémon.\c\nThe Kalos region just so happens to have\na lot of stones. That makes me think that\r\nanything could happen here.
[~ 2]
I’m very particular about the Speed of Pokémon!
That’s why I’m wondering if you have any Pokémon\nwith a Speed of [VAR NUM3(0001)] or greater with you!
Your [VAR PKNAME(0000)] is fast!\nJust like I like them!\c\nThat makes me really happy, so I’ll give you this!
[~ 6]
There are many different Pokémon\nwith many different Speeds! ♪\c\nIf you’d like, please come\nvisit me again tomorrow, OK?
Worry not! There’s more to Pokémon than Speed.\c\nBut what I’d really like to see today is a Pokémon\nwith Speed greater than [VAR NUM3(0001)]!

Welcome, future archaeologists!\c\nYou were drawn here by the\nmystique of Fossils no doubt!
Wait for me.
Wait for me.
My name is Serena, and this is [VAR TRNAME(0000)].\c\nWe’re researching Mega Evolution, and we were\nwondering if you know anything about it.
I’m Calem, and this is [VAR TRNAME(0000)].\c\nWe’re researching Mega Evolution.\nDo you know anything about it?
Oho! So you’re Professor Sycamore’s students!\nI’ve heard about you!\c\nMega Evolution, you say...\nI’m sorry, but all I know is that it has\r\nsomething to do with mysterious stones...\c\nStill, since you’re students of the professor,\nyou must know about Pokémon Fossils, correct?
Wonderful! I expect no less from\nProfessor Sycamore’s students!\c\nThat’s right! Fossils are the legacy\nof prehistoric Pokémon!\c\nYou should really go to the dig site\nand see the real thing firsthand.
How unexpected! I would have thought Professor\nSycamore’s students would know the basics.\c\nListen well. Fossils are the legacy of Pokémon\nfrom the distant past!\c\nI think you should definitely go to the dig site\nand see the real thing!
My assistant loves excavating Fossils!\c\nWhen he’s hard at work digging,\nhe loses sight of all else.
Now, if you bring us Pokémon Fossils,\nwe will be happy to restore them for you!\c\nOh, and did you know, sometimes you will find\nFossils in rocks you can break with Rock Smash!\c\nDo your best out there, and make\nProfessor Sycamore proud!
I hear I have you two to thank\nfor my assistant’s return.\c\nThank you very much!\nTake this as my thanks!
I had completely forgotten that we also\nfound that when we were digging up Fossils.\c\nBy the way, did you know that the Pokémon\nAerodactyl can be restored from Old Amber?\c\nSometimes you can find Old Amber when you\nbreak a rock with Rock Smash.
Oh. I see.\c\nWell, if you don’t know anything\nabout Mega Evolution, then...
Is that so?\c\nWell, if you don’t know\nanything about Mega Evolution...
Hold on! Pokémon that can be restored\nfrom Fossils just might have something\r\nto do with Mega Evolution.\c\nThe assistant in Glittering Cave\nright now might know about that!
What should I do? Well, since I’m already here,\nmaybe I should go talk to that assistant...
Are you going to Glittering Cave, [VAR TRNICK(0001)]?
Well... As long as I’m here, I guess\nI’ll go see that assistant.
Heading to Glittering Cave, [VAR TRNICK(0001)]?
We have a machine that restores Fossils\nand turns them back into Pokémon.\c\nBut only the assistant in Glittering\nCave knows how to use it.
If you show the assistant a Fossil,\nhe will turn it back into a Pokémon.
You must have come to the Fossil Lab\nbecause you like Fossils.
Now you...have the kind of face\na Rhyhorn will like.
The Rhyhorn on Route 9 used to race,\nso it loves having people ride on it.
If you have a Pokémon called Genesect\nwith you, please let me know, all right?
Is that Pokémon with you...\nGenesect?!\c\nWell then, why don’t I give you\nthese four drives?
An acquaintance in the Unova region\ngave me these plans.\c\nBased on them, I made these four drives:\nthe Douse Drive, Shock Drive,\r\nBurn Drive, and Chill Drive.
Genesect is also rumored to have\nbeen found in Glittering Cave...\r\nIt’s only a rumor though.
The bookshelf is packed\nwith research materials.
Excavated Fossils are lined\nup on the shelves.

Thanks for visiting our aquarium!\nYour interest marines so much to us!
The Pokémon on the far side of the glass...\c\nAll they see every day is the strange faces\nof the humans who have come to see them.
Do you think there are still Pokémon\nthat’ve never been seen down there?\c\nDeep, deep in the depths of the sea...
Wowzers! I just saw a fish Pokémon\nhiding behind that rock!
Aw, I wanna swim in the\nsea with the Pokémon!
A wandering young Trainer, are you?\c\nLet me guess--you wish to fish\nfor all the Pokémon in the sea, right?\r\nI’m sure you do! Shall I lend you a rod?\c\nI’m a fishing fanatic, and I’ve collected\nmore Old Rods than I could ever use!
You really do want to fish for all\nof the Pokémon in the sea, huh?\r\nThen how about I give you a rod?\c\nAfter all, I have more Old Rods\nthan I know what to do with!
Yeah!
Not now.
There you are: one fishing rod!\nI’ll teach you quickly how to use it.\c\nFirst, you’ve got to face the water when you use it.\nIf an exclamation mark appears, press the A Button!\c\nYou can either try to catch the Pokémon that you\nfish or just beat ’em in battle! It’s up to you now!
Ah hm! What a modest la[VAR GENDBR(00FF,0201)]dss you are, hm?\c\nLook at that lovely, spacious Bag of yours!\nI’m sure you have space for an Old Rod!
Mrrraowr!
The amazing Pokémon Ability Storm Drain!\c\nNot only does it draw all Water-type moves\nto a Pokémon--it even raises their Sp. Atk!
There are many types of Pokémon in the wider\nworld. Solely Water types are most populous...\r\nAfter Normal types, of course!
Route 8 continues on out that door there.\c\nThat’s right! Route 8 sure is a long one!\nIt runs down the cliffs, through Ambrette\r\nTown, along the sea, and all the way to\r\nthe next town!

You can normally ride the Rhyhorn\nto get to Glittering Cave, but we’re\r\ngiving them a little break.
Oh! Are you going to search for Fossils in\nGlittering Cave?\c\nYou’ll have to ride on a Rhyhorn to get there\nin that case!\c\nRiding Rhyhorn is so much fun...\nYou can even pretend that you’re the famous\r\nRhyhorn racer, Grace!
Pokémon moves that come in\ndirect physical contact with\r\nthe target are direct attacks.\c\nIf you want to do something\nabout them, you can try this!
If a Pokémon holding a Rocky Helmet takes a\ndirect attack, the attacker takes damage, too!\c\nCombine that with an Ability like Iron Barbs\nor Rough Skin, and it’ll really start to sting!
I like to ride Rhyhorn, too!\c\n“Press the A Button to find a way over the clay!”\nThat little ditty will teach you how!

Hi there, neighbor!
This is Ambrette Town.\c\nYou just go through the aquarium\nto get to Cyllage City, but...

Here, Trainer! Use this TM!\nIt’s Rock Smash!
Rock Smash may also lower the other\nPokémon’s ability to defend itself.\r\nThat makes up for what it lacks in power.
I wonder how strong the Smeargle\nI left at the Day Care has become.\c\nDo you know about Smeargle’s move Sketch?\c\nIt takes the move the other Pokémon\nused and makes it into its own!

Hello...
I have to apologize to you about Lysandre...\nI’m very sorry for the trouble he caused...
And I’d also like to thank you!\c\nI’m sincerely grateful for what you did for\nall of the Pokémon and people of this world.\c\nAnd by stopping Team Flare, you also\nsaved Lysandre.
I always knew that he desired a beautiful world...
And maybe someday the population of people\nand Pokémon will actually increase to where\r\nresources become very scarce.\c\nIf someone acts out of greed in such a world,\nsurely some will go without.
If all living things keep acting that way,\nthere will be nothing left at all in the end.\r\nWhy, there won’t even be anything left\r\nto steal, will there?
But what I really wanted was for\nhim to put his ego aside and lead\r\neverything to greater heights.\c\nI never had this discussion with him, though.\nSo I’m partially responsible for this.
Well, enough of that.\n[VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\c\nI want you and your Pokémon to take\neverything you learned from your journey\r\nand hit me with your very best shot!
The strength you’ve found is simply marvelous!\nAnd...
You truly love and trust your Pokémon!
[VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\nA treasure of mine is hidden in this town!\r\nIf you’d like, try to find it.\c\nWell, I’ll be off then! I have many\npreparations I must attend to!\c\nI have a little surprise planned for\nall of you to thank you for fighting\r\nTeam Flare and saving Kalos!
It’s a message written in neatly carved letters.
“To the person reading this:\c\nWhat are you like now?\nDid you become who you wanted to be?\c\nFor starters, what was the person you\nwanted to become even like?\c\nI don’t know, but it would be wonderful if you\ncan boast that you’re living each day to its fullest.\c\nTo future Sycamore.\nFrom the Sycamore dreaming of the future.”
Powerful moves have fewer PP,\nwhich is short for Power Points.\c\nAccomplished Trainers use\nPP Up on such moves.
I really like the story of the\nMagikarp climbing the waterfall.
Are you familiar with the Abilities\nthat keep Pokémon from fleeing battle?\c\nTee hee hee! Those Abilities don’t\nwork on Ghost-type Pokémon!
In an album, you see pictures that make you\nremember the excitement you felt at that time.\c\nIn Dendemille Town, you can make\nPokémon remember moves they once knew...
How about Couriway Town’s famous Fresh Water?\nIt’s $300 a bottle!
Fresh Water!\nFresh Water!
Here’s something extra.\nTake it now. Don’t be shy.
Couriway Town’s Fresh Water!\nOnly a pro can tell the difference in taste!
Please stop by again tomorrow!
It’s worth no less than $300.\nI can’t bring the price down $1.

One of the ways that Pokémon Trainers\nmake their Pokémon strong is to use TMs!\c\nI know it’s a bit sudden, but do tell me:\nDo you have the TM for [VAR MOVE(0000)]?
I know! It’s so sudden again! But tell me:\nDo you have the TM for [VAR MOVE(0000)]?
It’s certainly the TM for\n[VAR MOVE(0000)]!\c\nAre you making your Pokémon\neven stronger by using it?
What? I can’t find the TM for\n[VAR MOVE(0000)] anywhere.
Are you a reserved person?
By utilizing TMs well, your Pokémon can\nbeat its opponent even if your\r\nPokémon is weak against it!\c\nYou can use TMs as many times as\nyou want!\c\nIf you don’t like a move, you can ask a man\nin town to help a Pokémon forget it!

A Pokémon holding a Shell Bell recovers its HP\na little bit if it inflicts damage during a battle.\c\nBut what’s more important is this: Have\nyou shown the Pokédex to a professor?

Why hello, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!
How have you been?
How’s your journey going?\c\nYou see, when I was younger, I visited\nmany different regions as well.\c\nI met many kinds of Pokémon and noticed\nhow each place has its own distinct flavors.\c\nSo, I really came to enjoy trying new foods\nas I traveled.\c\nBecause of my adventures, I’m an expert\non the cafés all over Kalos.
Um... Professor...
Come now, Dexio.\nI’m going somewhere with this.
Do you remember the Pokémon Lysandre\nmentioned in that café?
Wonderful!\nI knew you would!
I suppose you wouldn’t.\c\nIt’s important to forget\nthings from time to time.
Kalos’s Legendary Pokémon is called...\c\nXerneas!
Kalos’s Legendary Pokémon is called...\c\nYveltal!
According to material I’ve read, those who\nsaw it were so overwhelmed by its power,\r\nthey were only able to say that this Pokémon\r\nresembled the letter X.
According to material I’ve read, those who\nsaw it were so overwhelmed by its power,\r\nthey were only able to say that this Pokémon\r\nresembled the letter Y.
Apparently, this Pokémon can control energy.\c\nIt gives life energy to plants and Pokémon,\nand makes them full of vitality again.
Apparently, this Pokémon will absorb energy.\c\nIts life span is said to be 1,000 years.\nWhen it reaches the end of its life,\r\nit steals all of the spirits around it.
Wherever do you think a Pokémon that amazing\ncould be now?
When Kalos’s Legendary Pokémon loses all\nof its vitality, it goes to sleep in a secret place.\c\nI don’t have a clue where it could be.\c\nThe writings that mention it are also around a\nthousand years old, so they aren’t much help.
It would be absolutely astounding if\nyou found it, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].
It would be absolutely astounding if\nyou found it, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].
Maybe I’ll look into the legend a little bit.\nIf I find something, I’ll let you know!
Ah ha ha! Oh, it would be a thrill if you\nfound it, indeed!\c\nBut your journey is yours and your\nPokémon’s alone.\c\nI want you to enjoy yourself and do\nwhatever you’d like!
Um... Is the Professor gone already?
I was hoping to have him have\na look at my Pokédex in person.\c\nOh well, I can still get my Pokédex\nevaluated at a Pokémon Center’s PC...\c\nAnyway, I’m heading off to go look\nfor Pokémon in the Frost Cavern\r\nand fill up more of my Pokédex!
Mamoswine is amazing!\nIt lived 10,000 years frozen in ice!

Someone wandering for 3,000 years\ntrying to find a Pokémon...\c\nI’ve heard a story about a man like that,\nbut you can’t believe everything you hear.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I hear the history of this area\ngoes back to ancient times.\c\nYou can probably get the details\nfrom the guide in the hotel.
For some reason, a Pokémon will not evolve\nwhen it holds an Everstone.\c\nI have quite a few of them,\nso I’ll share one with you as well.
Could Pokémon and stones have some\nkind of connection?\c\nThink about it. Some Pokémon even evolve\nwhen exposed to a Fire Stone or Water Stone.

Welcome to Hotel Marine Snow, located right here\nin cozy Geosenge Town--the town of stones!
And where might you be from?\c\n... ... ...\n... ... ...\c\nIs that right? All the way from Vaniville Town?\nWell, it’s a pleasure to have you here!
I think your [VAR PKNAME(0000)] is great, too!
It makes me happy when other people\nlike the same Pokémon as me!\c\nI get curious about people who like\ndifferent Pokémon than I do.
H...hello.
You saw those huge stones on\nRoute 10, didn’t you?\c\nSome of the bigger ones are\nmore than 30 feet tall!\c\nAnd there are hundreds of millions\nof them, spanning more than a mile in all!
I suppose it’s possible that people put up\nthose stones with help from lots of Pokémon,\r\nbut for what purpose? Why are they there?
There are lots of theories about them, of course.\nSome people think they mark the burial site\r\nof warriors from ancient times.\c\nOthers say they were built as family\nmemorials or that they were set up\r\nfor a ritual to celebrate life.
I don’t know about all that, though. Personally,\nI think they might just be a kind of calendar.\c\nYou see it all the time in astronomy studies.\nAncient cultures used stones to track\r\nthe movement of the sun.
One thing is for sure--those\nstones are full of mysteries.\c\nMany believe that they contain\nsome kind of mysterious power.\c\nI just hope it’s a benign power that is\nwatching over us people and Pokémon.\c\nSpeaking of which, there are some mysterious\nstones in the neighboring Shalour City, too.
The stones were there to absorb energy from\nPokémon? I guess the theory about them\r\nbeing gravestones wasn’t too far off!\c\nThankfully, they were destroyed, which\nmeans no Pokémon have to worry about\r\ntheir energy getting stolen now!
Ouaf!

These big stones are pretty resistant to\nweathering, which has made them a symbol\r\nof the eternal for many people.\c\nLots of folks even think the stones\npossess some kind of mysterious power.
Did you see that thing come up\nfrom inside the ground? Crazy...
Did you come here to see the\nbig stones with your Pokémon?\c\nMaybe you’ll get lucky, and the stones will\nimpart some of their power to your Pokémon!
That thing was under us this whole time?\nWhat caused it to come up from underground?
If you have a Pokémon that is\npretty slow, give this one a try!
The Payback move doubles in power if it\ngoes off after its target makes its move!

[VAR TRNICK(0000)], was someone from\nTeam Flare here just now?
Yes
No...
He was here...\nBut he isn’t anymore, is he?\c\nAnd the only thing past here\nis a dead end...\c\nThere’s something very weird\nabout Team Flare...
You said he was here...\nBut he isn’t anymore, is he?\c\nThere’s only a dead end up ahead...\nI wonder where that Team Flare guy went...
You don’t need to protect me!\nI chased a Team Flare Grunt here.\c\nBut the only thing past here\nis a dead end...\c\nThere’s something very weird\nabout Team Flare...
You don’t have to worry about me.\nI chased a Team Flare Grunt here.\c\nBut there’s only a dead end up ahead...\nI wonder where that Team Flare guy went...
And in conclusion...\c\nThe stones on Route 10 are lined up\nso they connect to Geosenge Town.\c\nCyllage City’s Gym Leader, Grant,\nis researching them, but much about\r\nthese stones remains unknown.
Hey, you! If you want to know more\nabout the stones, come to the Hotel!
Arranging so many stones like that\nis really impressive.\r\nPeople were amazing 3,000 years ago.
This has to be the work of extraterrestrials!\nThere’s no other explanation!
So in the end nobody really knows...\nThe world is full of things like that.
You’re a pretty sophisticated traveler\nif you’re here to check out the monument.
Nothing but rocks here, you say?\c\nNon, non! You don’t get it.\c\nThis town has nothing else,\nso it’s obvious how amazing the stones are!
Geosenge Town\nQuiet stones speak volumes.
Hotel Marine Snow\nWhere wanderers rest.
These ancient stones are said\nto emit a mysterious power.
Phew...\nI’m so glad you’re all safe!
I really respect the courage\nand kindness all of you showed.
Thank you... We’re all fine.\c\nAre you guys all OK, Tierno?
Thank you... We all got out in one piece.\c\nAre you guys all OK, Tierno?
Yep! As you can see, we’re doing great!\nThanks for asking!\c\nWe worked together to save the Pokémon\nconnected to the stones on Route 10!\c\nI mostly left battling with Team Flare\nto Sina and Dexio, though...
Who are these Sina and Dexio you speak of?\nWe’re the masked heroes!
Don’t worry about it, Tierno.\c\nWe were all doing the best we could\nto stop Team Flare’s plans.\c\nOh, we have a little bit of news for you all.\c\nWe managed to destroy the machine\nin Lysandre’s lab that was spying on\r\npeople’s Holo Caster transmissions.
So, we won’t have to deal\nwith Team Flare anymore.\c\nNow, I can go back\nto filling up my Pokédex!
So...it’s finally over, right?\nWe can go back to our adventure, right?!\c\nLet’s go back to Anistar City\nand start over from where we left off!
Thank you, [VAR TRNICK(0000)].\c\nI have so much respect for you as a friend.\c\nIt’s because I respect you that I want\nto beat you in battle as your rival!\c\nI really mean it!
Thanks, [VAR TRNICK(0000)].\nI respect you as a friend.\c\nThat’s why I want to beat you in battle\nas your rival!
A long, long time ago.\nA very long time ago.
The man made an ultimate weapon.
Using it required the life force of many Pokémon...
The Pokémon granted eternal life learned this.
The resurrected eternal Pokémon left\nthe man’s side.
The man was surprised and sad.\nHe had revived it so they could be together...
Day after day passed, but they were never to meet.\nEventually, he became a mere shell of a man.
A man condemned to wander forever\nby the light of the weapon...
And a Pokémon that also\nwanders eternally...
Where is it now?\nWhat do I have to do to meet it?
Are you wondering about the ultimate weapon,\ntoo, [VAR TRNICK(0000)]?\c\nThat man wanted to bring his Pokémon back\neven if it meant breaking the laws of nature.\c\nI wonder if I would feel that way\nif I lost my partner...\c\nThis is changing the subject, but...
Have you caught [VAR PKNAME(0001)] yet?
I thought you might have!\nI caught one, too!\c\nIt makes you smile when you catch the\nsame Pokémon as a friend does, huh?
Hmm. I see that you’ve seen it, though.
There are still many\nPokémon to search for.
According to Professor Sycamore’s research,\n[VAR PKNAME(0001)] has a potential Mega Evolution!
So the ultimate weapon can only be powered\nwith the life energy of Pokémon...
Nope! I can’t hear them!\nI won’t listen to the Pokémon’s cries!
I can’t let you go beyond this point!\nA kid like you shouldn’t be exposed to such sights.
The mysterious stone is\nabsorbing energy...
Um? Where was the entrance to our\nsecret HQ again? Was it in a boulder?
Only Team Flare’s\nstayin’ alive, stayin’ alive.
I bought a new life for $5,000,000!
It’s an ancient artifact?
[VAR TRNICK(0000)], I’m coming with you!
When I was in Lysandre’s lab, the\nmasked heroes told me what is going on.\c\nThey also told me what Team Flare plans\nto do with the ultimate weapon!\c\nC’mon! Let’s stop Team Flare... No...\nWe have to stop Lysandre himself!\c\nThe world isn’t corrupt enough to give up\non yet!
[VAR TRNICK(0000)], you’re not in this alone!
When I was in Lysandre’s lab, the\nmasked heroes told me what is going on.\c\nThey also told me what Team Flare plans\nto do with the ultimate weapon!\c\nC’mon! Let’s stop Team Flare... No...\nWe have to stop Lysandre himself!\c\nI...I want to protect my friends!
Lucario! What are you doing?
Hey! You’re that Trainer from Route 5!
Awwof!
I’m not exactly sure, but I think Lucario\nis saying it wants to battle with you.\r\nWould you battle with us?
So, I have two Lucario...\c\nBut do you know which is the one\nthat has taken a shine to you?
Yeah, I guess that was a pretty\nsudden request, wasn’t it?\c\nWell, we’ll just have to battle\nwhen you’re ready then!
OK! Now I get it!\nI see why Lucario likes you so much!\c\nSo! Do you remember that I’m the Gym Leader\nin Shalour City?\c\nOnce you get past the cave just beyond here,\nyou’ll be there, so stop by and say hello!
You’d better have come here prepared!\nBoth you and your Pokémon!
Lysandre does whatever he can to help us realize\nour goals. Surely he deserves respect for that!
Huh... Geosenge sure had an amazing thing\nresting below it.\c\nIt’s hard to put into words how amazing\nit was...
Ha ha ha!\c\nThere might’ve been nothing but stones here\nbefore, but now this town has a big ol’ hole!

Yo, how’s it going there? I’m Cassius.\nCheck this out. You know what I’m doing here?\c\nI’m keeping the PC Box running! No, seriously!\c\nBill over in Kanto asked me to come here and\nrun things. For real!\c\nEnough with the introductions. Get out there, catch\nsome Pokémon, and put ’em in the PC!
Yo, you got something you wanna ask me?\nI ain’t got all day, you know?
Boxes
The Battle Box
Trays
Nothing
Boxes are pretty sweet. You can store up to 30\nof your Pokémon in a single Box.\c\nYou start out with only eight of ’em, but the more\nPokémon you deposit, the more Boxes will appear!\r\nNo, seriously! It’s like magic!\c\nThat’s not all, either. You can swap whole Boxes\nat once if you want. For real!
The Battle Box is no joke, yo!\c\nGot Pokémon you use in battle a lot? Put up to six\nof ’em in the Battle Box. Hold up--I’ll explain why.\c\nSee, if you’re having a Link Battle over the\nInternet, local wireless, infrared connection,\r\nor by using the Battle Spot, you can choose to\r\nuse the Pokémon in your Battle Box instead of\r\nthe ones in your party.\c\nThat means you don’t have to go to the trouble of\nmoving around Pokémon before a battle.\r\nIt’s crazy convenient! For real!
Trays are totally awesome, dude!\c\nThey let you select a bunch of Pokémon at\na time and move ’em around the PC Box.\c\nNo, seriously! They’re a lifesaver\nonce you’ve caught a lot of Pokémon.
They got PCs in every Pokémon Center, right?\c\nBoot one up, and you can edit your\nTrainer PR Videos. No, seriously!
Take this, Thief!
With the Thief move, you can take the target’s\nheld item while dealing damage to it!\c\nIt won’t work if the user is already holding\nan item, though.

Hi, [VAR TRNICK(0000)]!
An acquaintance of yours?\nTwo visitors to Shabboneau Castle?\c\nI can’t remember the last time\nwe’ve been so busy!\c\nThis castle, chateau if you will,\nwas a manor house of a noble family.
It may be a little run down, but that’s\nbecause there’s history to this place.
During that history, the owners of this castle\ngave away a lot of their stuff to everyone,\r\nso that’s why it feels so empty. The end.
That’s it?! Don’t you have anything\nrelated to Mega Evolution?
That’s it.\nWhat in the world is Mega Evolution?
...
Sir!\nIt’s back again.
Is it that time of year already?\nWell, there’s nothing I can do about that now...
I need to go to Route 7, but please\ntake your time and have a look around.
I wonder what that’s about.
Why don’t we go to Route 7, too?

A quarter?\c\nHmm, that’s probably overblowing it, too.\nOne percent! You’re missing at least one percent!
Anyway! The point is!\c\nYou’ve really got to check\nout Shabboneau Castle!\r\nAfter all, it’s free to go in!
Shabboneau Castle must look pretty\ndifferent to you than it does to me.\c\nWe are different people, after all.
It’s about that time again, huh...\nThat lazy lug’ll be back soon...
No one wishes more than us that we could\ngive Snorlax gobs of Berries like we used to.
Welcome, welcome, dear visitor!\nHere, take this for your Pokémon!
Even if you try to keep it all for yourself,\na human like you or me can’t use that!
Hey there! I’ll give you this, so tell all your\nfriends to come to Camphrier Town, OK?!

Oh, Tierno, do you ever think\nabout anything besides dancing?
Nope! Even during Pokémon battles,\nI’m always checkin’ out their moves!\c\nAnd then my feet just starting moving,\ntoo! I can’t even help it, y’know?\r\nLike with Swords Dance! I love it!\c\nI guess that’s why I can never win...

Oh, uh, [VAR TRNICK(0000)]?\nDo take this Honey, won’t you?
You see, using Honey will encourage Pokémon\nhordes to appear.\c\nThough if you are going to challenge a\nwhole horde...\c\nYou may want to use moves that can hit\nmultiple targets.

Come in!\c\nYou know, my grandparents came\nto Kalos from a distant region.\c\nThey came from a town where the past lives on...\c\nWhen I was growing up at their knees, they\nraised me on tales of the Pokémon of\r\ntime and space.\c\nIt’s really thanks to those stories that I decided\nto become a Dragon-type Trainer.
Oh, you! You’re too much!\c\nYou and your Pokémon\nare simply charming!
Oh, you’re going already? Farewell, then!
Oh, dear me. Was I the first to lose to you all?\c\nIf I’ve made you feel too confident, that\nwon’t be very fair to the others...\c\nBut I suppose you’d best hurry along to that\nelevator over there to face them for yourself.
And I was even the second you’ve beaten!\c\nAh, I suppose it’s just as well, really...\c\nGo on. It’s time for you to show the\nlast two of us how strong you are.
With your Pokémon, I’m sure\nyou can beat the last of us.
You have beaten all of the Elite Four!\c\nThis is just wonderful for you. Congratulations!

Well met, young challenger!\c\nVerily am I the Elite Four’s famed blade\nof hardened Steel, Wikstrom!\c\nWith my magnificent Pokémon at my side,\nI will reveal the scope of Trainer achievement!\c\nLet us both give our word that our contest\nshall be fair and honorable. Ready?\c\nEn garde!
What now? What sweet, glorious pain and joy\nnow rock my mighty heart?\c\nMy will, which even shakes spears, trembles\nat so fine a battle as this! I am undone!\c\nGood sir, you are indeed our equal--\nand worthy to enter this lofty hall!

Easy, child. You need not explain. It is no mystery\nto me why you came to me first.\c\nNature herself has framed man as such a creature\nthat any would choose to face their strongest\r\nenemy before all others.\c\nNow, to the elevator with you! It burns with a\ndesire to hasten you on your way!
So you have struck down two of the Elite Four!\c\nThe road is still long. Do not waver now.
Is your heart prepared for this?\nOne last wall remains before you.\c\nYou would do well to remember: defeat us, and\nthen you will face the Champion in battle!
The time has come at last for your\ngreatest challenge.\c\nNow show our Champion the same strength you\nhave shown us!

... ... ...\nNo, I simply can’t say.
You there! Young [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0403)]manlady!\nI have a question I must pose to you.\c\nDo you think Pokémon battling can\never be worthy of being called an art?
... ... ...\nIndeed.\c\nYou see, cooking is the type of art that\ndisappears as soon as it is completed.\c\nPokémon battles are the same. Even memories\nof sweet victory soon fade after the battle ends.\c\nTo devote yourself entirely to such a life, made\nup of fleeting experiences--that is truly artful.
Fool! You silly, unseeing child!\c\nIf all you seek in life is to fill your\nstomach with some tasteless matter,\r\nthen why are there Chefs in this world?!\c\nWe labor tirelessly to make something\nwonderful that will disappear from sight\r\nas soon as it is enjoyed.\c\nThat is the life of a Chef!\nThat is the life of a Trainer!
Devote yourself entirely, so even that\nwhich will fade and disappear is ingrained\r\nforever upon your heart and mind!\c\nThat is the only fate for any human.
There are no weak Pokémon in a Pokémon\nbattle. There are only weak Trainers.\c\nFind the good in every one of your Pokémon.\nDraw out the unique strengths they possess.\c\nNow step back into that elevator and\nreturn to the room from which you came.
It is the duty of both Trainers and Chefs to find the\ngood in any raw materials they have to work with.\c\nThere lies the answer to reaching ever higher.\nBattle the last two of us and find it for yourself.
There is only one course remaining in\nyour Pokémon League banquet.\c\nDevour it with the hunger for strength.\nSavor it without leaving a scrap behind.
You have drawn forth the strength of Pokémon\nwith your own particular style and method.\r\nAnd now you can challenge the Champion.

Oh, I can’t tell you how happy I am to meet\nyou again...\c\nI feel like my heart might just burst into flames.\c\nI’m burning up with my hatred for you, runt!
Oooh, you wicked little Trainer!\nYou’re just too much, you know?\c\nYou’re so amusing that I just want to burn you up\nwhere you stand!\c\nBut I’ll let you live... After all...\c\nIf you want your dreams to come true, you have to\nbe strong enough to force them to happen.\c\nTeam Flare wasn’t strong enough to do that,\nbut I can see that you are.
Three more members of the Elite Four stand\nbetween you and the Champion.\c\nTake that elevator there to return to the main\nhall if you’re ready for them.
Beat the last two members of the Elite Four, and\nyou can face the Champion.
If you beat the last of the Elite Four, you’ll face\nthe Champion.
You’ll be facing down the Champion next.

Defeating the Champion\nis one step to growing stronger.\c\nWell, I guess I should wait to say that\nafter defeating the Champion.
Is adapting to any opposing Trainer\nthe sign of real strength?\c\nOr is strength more about staying true\nto my own style?

I am a traveling minstrel, wandering the world.\nPlease listen to my song and hear my words...\c\nThe Kalos region, now upheld as fair,\nFrom ancient days an ugly past doth bear.\c\nThe woes of war did knock on every door,\nTill man nor Pokémon could take no more,\r\nThree thousand years ago, upon this shore.
So many lives were lost--both man and ’mon.\nIt seemed a night that ne’er would bring dawn.\c\nNo beauty, no joy in those days of yore.\nOnly the pain of parting was in store\r\nFor victims of the ancient Kalos war.
Man’s grief brought the end, the land did tear,\nWartime finished in a lightning flare.\c\n’Mon’s rage brought the end, a furious roar.\nLightning crackled forth to end the war--\r\nKalos’s long pain was then no more.
One man, through it all, lives ever on.\nTo a Pokémon once lost, he’s ever drawn.\c\nOne man, through it all, lives ever on.\nSearching for his heart, long lost and gone.
Would you care to listen on...\nto the completion of my song?

You can call me the Judge.\c\nHeh heh, that’s actually not my real name,\nbut it’s what everyone calls me.\c\nIt’s because of this weird power I have.\nIt’s a gift, really.\c\nI can discern--or judge, you might say--the\noverall potential of individual Pokémon.\c\nHow about it? Let me judge the intriguing\npotential of your Pokémon!
Hey there! So how about it? Are you gonna let me\njudge the intriguing potential of your Pokémon?
...Oh?\nYou don’t need me to judge? I get it.
Judge an Egg?!\nThat’s a tall order even for me!
I see... I see...\c\nThis Pokémon’s potential is\ndecent all around.\c\nThat’s how I judge it, anyway.
I see... I see...\c\nThis Pokémon’s potential is\nabove average overall.\c\nThat’s how I judge it, anyway.
I see... I see...\c\nThis Pokémon has relatively\nsuperior potential overall.\c\nThat’s how I judge it, anyway.
I see... I see...\c\nThis Pokémon has outstanding\npotential overall.\c\nThat’s how I judge it, anyway.
Incidentally, I would say that its\ngreatest potential lies in its HP.
Incidentally, I would say that its greatest\npotential lies in its Attack stat.
Incidentally, I would say that its greatest\npotential lies in its Defense stat.
Incidentally, I would say that its greatest\npotential lies in its Sp. Atk stat.
Incidentally, I would say that its greatest\npotential lies in its Sp. Def stat.
Incidentally, I would say that its greatest\npotential lies in its Speed stat.
But its Attack stat is good, too.
Hmm. And its Defense stat is good, too.
Although its Sp. Atk stat is equally good.
Its Sp. Def stat seems just as good, though.
And, well, its Speed stat is good, too.
It has rather decent stats, I’d say.\nThat’s how I judge it.
It’s definitely got some good stats.\nThat’s how I judge it.
This Pokémon has some fantastic stats.\nThat’s how I judge it.
Stats like those... They simply can’t be beat!\nThat’s how I judge it.
But its HP... It’s pretty dismal, you know?
But this Attack stat... It’s terrible...
But how can you make it through battle\nwith this kind of Defense stat?
But this Sp. Atk won’t even leave\na scratch on an opponent...
But this low of a Sp. Def stat is going to\nleave you high and dry...
But you won’t get anywhere fast with\nthis low of a Speed stat...
And that’s quite a disappointing Attack\nstat there, isn’t it?
And that Defense stat is nothing to write\nhome about, you know?
And I’m afraid that its Sp. Atk is pretty\nbad, too...
And it looks like it’s no great shakes when\nit comes to Sp. Def either...
And that Speed stat... Well, it’s nothing\nto brag about, that’s for sure.

You know about the mysterious object\ncalled the Anistar Sundial, right?\c\nApparently, even the most cutting-edge\nscientific techniques can’t break it.
Some people call out-of-place artifacts\nlike this “OOPArt.” This might have been\r\nmade with the mysterious power of Pokémon.
Why, hello, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\c\nRunning around all over Kalos is\nactually rather tiring, is it not?\c\nOh yeah, I’m the one making you\ndo that, aren’t I?\c\nTerribly sorry about that!

Well, Calem may have already told you, but\nI found a way to power up the Mega Ring!\c\nBefore we get to that, however...
Let’s talk about Mega Stones briefly.\c\nMy theory is that they’re special stones\nirradiated by the light--the energy of the\r\nLegendary Pokémon Xerneas--fired from\r\nthe ultimate weapon 3,000 years ago.
Let’s talk about Mega Stones briefly.\c\nMy theory is that they’re special stones\nirradiated by the light--the energy of the\r\nLegendary Pokémon Yveltal--fired from\r\nthe ultimate weapon 3,000 years ago.
And that’s what I think they are.\c\nIt’s even possible that stones like Fire Stones\nwere what turned into these Mega Stones.
So, what’s the Mega Ring that you are holding?\c\nThat mysterious stone transforms feelings felt\ntoward Pokémon into some kind of wavelength.
The Mega Ring works in a similar way\nto how this object over here works.\c\nIt’s an object that changes sunlight\ninto a mysterious light.
For one hour starting at 8 pm,\nthis sundial starts emitting light.\c\nThis mysterious object has towered\nover the city here for over 3,000 years.\c\nIt’s relationship to the Mega Ring isn’t\nunderstood at all yet.
Now, let’s get down to the heart of the matter!\c\n[VAR TRNAME(0000)]! Try touching the sundial!
You were exposed to the Legendary Pokémon’s\nenergy in Team Flare’s secret HQ.\c\nAnd the Mega Ring has absorbed the\npower of the sundial.\c\nThese two powers have combined\nto upgrade your Mega Ring.\c\nNow, it will react to underground Mega Stones,\nbut only when the sundial is emitting light.\c\nI’m sure these stones hide in every corner\nof Kalos! Use this power to find them!

Oh, welcome, [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0A03)]sonyoung lady.\c\nDo you have questions about\nhow to take care of Berries?
All right! I’ll teach you anything!\nWhat do you want to know?
Check the soil where you planted Berries, and\nthen water the Berries. That’s all you have to do!\c\nAlthough the soil will dry out quickly or slowly\ndepending on the Berry or Mulch you’re using.
Sometimes weeds grow in the\nsoil where you planted Berries.\c\nWhen that happens, check the soil\nand yank out the weed!
Sometimes hungry Bug Pokémon\nare drawn to Berry trees...\c\nIf you don’t want to give them all Berries,\ncheck the trees and battle against them!
After the Berries on Berry trees ripen, if you don’t\ndo anything, they will wither and dry out.
The more you take care of them,\nthe more Berries you can get!\c\nOne Berry can produce more Berries.\nThat’s the best part of fieldwork.

Cancel
Your Pokédex must be jam-packed with\nall the memories of your journey...\r\nI hope you treasure it always!
Incredible! You’ve already completed\nthe Central Kalos Pokédex!
Incredible! You’ve already completed\nthe Coastal Kalos Pokédex!
Incredible! You’ve already completed\nthe Mountain Kalos Pokédex!
Incredible! You’ve already completed\nthe National Pokédex!
Hmm... So you’ve seen [VAR NUM3(0000)] kind[VAR NUMBRNCH(0000,0100)]s of Pokémon\nin Central Kalos, then.
Oh ho! You’ve seen [VAR NUM3(0000)] kind[VAR NUMBRNCH(0000,0100)]s of Pokémon\nin Coastal Kalos.
I see! You’ve seen [VAR NUM3(0000)] kind[VAR NUMBRNCH(0000,0100)]s of Pokémon\nin Mountain Kalos.
You’ve caught a total of [VAR NUM3(0000)] kind[VAR NUMBRNCH(0000,0100)]s\nof Pokémon! Fantastic!
And you caught [VAR NUM3(0001)] of those Pokémon\nspecies in the Kalos region!
How fantastic!\c\nYou’ve caught every kind of Pokémon\nin the Kalos region!
Wow! You successfully completed the\nCentral Kalos Pokédex! Wonderful!
Fantastic! You successfully completed\nthe Coastal Kalos Pokédex! Great work!
Amazing! You successfully completed\nthe Mountain Kalos Pokédex! Superb!
You have to get yourself in that tall grass\nif you’re going to find any Pokémon!
Oh ho! The pages are getting filled in.\nIt’s starting to look good!
Some Pokémon can be hard to find,\nbut keep on searching in the tall grass!
Battling against other Trainers is another\ngood way to fill up your Pokédex!
Some Pokémon only appear\nin certain places! Keep an eye out!
Why hello! Find any Pokémon that\nyou’ve taken a particular shine to yet?
Just a little bit more, and you’ll have found\nevery kind of Pokémon in the Central Kalos area!
Congratulations! You’ve encountered every\nkind of Pokémon in the Central Kalos area!
A new Pokédex means new Pokémon!\nHow exciting!
I’ve heard that there are Trainers out there\nwho have some truly rare Pokémon with them!
Some Pokémon can be found only by fishing.\nAren’t Pokémon fascinating?
Some Pokémon can only\nbe seen inside caves!
Some Pokémon Abilities make it easier\nfor you to encounter wild Pokémon!
You should try using Surf to explore new areas\nand find the Pokémon that live there!
Just a little bit more, and you’ll have found\nevery kind of Pokémon in the Coastal Kalos area!
Congratulations! You’ve encountered every\nkind of Pokémon in the Coastal Kalos area!
The third Pokédex of the Kalos region!\nI wonder what kinds of Pokémon you’ll find!
It’s so interesting to look at the differences\nbetween the Pokémon that live in each area!
I’ll bet the Pokémon you can find in the\nmountains and caves are tough and rugged!
There are still many Pokémon awaiting you in\nlocations you’ve yet to visit!
It’s fascinating to learn how certain\nPokémon evolve!
Isn’t it great to learn about all of the different\nPokémon that are out there?
Just a little bit more, and you’ll have found\nevery kind of Pokémon in the Mountain Kalos area!
Congratulations! You’ve encountered every\nkind of Pokémon in the Mountain Kalos area!
Keep traveling through the Kalos region, and\nyou might find even more new encounters!
I hear there are more than 700 kinds of Pokémon\nto be found in the National Pokédex!
Now remember--the trick to catching a Pokémon\nis to lower its HP before using a Poké Ball!
Rumor has it that some Pokémon can only be\nencountered by hatching Eggs!
You won’t be able to find all of the underwater\nPokémon by fishing in just one spot!
The Sticky Hold and Suction Cups Abilities\nmake Pokémon easier to reel in when fishing.
Pokémon with the Magnet Pull Ability can help you\nencounter Steel-type Pokémon more easily!
Pokémon with the Static Ability can help you\nencounter Electric-type Pokémon more easily!
Some Pokémon only evolve by becoming\nfriendly with their Trainer!
Wow! You’ve caught 500 kinds of Pokémon!\nYou sure are an amazing Trainer!
Some Pokémon can only evolve at certain\ntimes of day or in certain places!
There are some moves that leave Pokémon\nwith just a tiny bit of HP left!
Some Pokémon have Abilities that prevent\nwild Pokémon from fleeing!
Wow, 600! Pokémon sure do live\nin all kinds of places!
You’re a Pokémon-catching pro, you know that?\nMy jaw drops at your incredible skills!
Trading Pokémon with friends is another great\nway to fill up your Pokédex!
If you have access, it might be a good idea\nto use the GTS, too!
Almost 700...\nJust a little bit more! Keep it up!
This is it! We’re in the final countdown for your\nmomentous completion of the National Pokédex!
Congratulations!\c\nThis is such an emotional moment!\nI’m so lucky to have met you!\c\nThis Pokédex could not have been completed\nwithout the sweat and hard work you put in as\r\na Pokémon Trainer...\c\nIt’s a one-of-a-kind treasure chest\npacked full of your dreams!

So this is the Kalos region, huh...\nNot bad...
I just love traveling around the world,\ngoing fishing with my trusty Old Rod.
Sure don’t see very many Magikarp\nin the Kalos region, do you?
You know what? I’d really like to have\nsomething to remember my trip to Kalos by.
How about this?\nI’ve got a special offer just for you!\c\nI’m willing to trade my super-secret\n[VAR PKNAME(0001)] here for [VAR iCOLOR2(0002)][VAR PKNAME(0002)]!\r\nWhaddaya say?
All right. All right!\nLet’s begin the trade!
Well, that sure is a shame...\nI had hoped we could’ve had ourselves\r\na Kanto-Kalos Pokémon trade!\r\nOh well...
No, thank you! I’m not interested in\nany more trading!
Hey, now--you’re gonna need at least two\nPokémon with you if you want to trade!
No way--I can’t trade you for that...
Check it out!\nI never drop the balls!
I’ve heard a lot about you!
Phew! How electrifying!
Ohh...\nI can’t help but sigh.\c\nI’m cheering for you, you know?\nCome on--take this!
I’m going to be keeping an eye on you!\nI have a feeling you’ll do great things!
Aren’t there any hot springs around here?\c\nWhere I come from, we have a hot spring right\nnext to the Pokémon Center, and it’s incredible!
Where I’m from, we put Pokémon Eggs\nin sand baths.
Riding the monorail here reminded me\nof taking the cable car on Mt. Chimney!
Here--I’ll share some with you!
It’s a Lava Cookie--a local specialty\nfrom Mt. Chimney!\r\nFeed it to a Pokémon to heal status conditions!
This is my first vacation in such a long time!
The Kalos region is so very big!
Everyone in the Kalos region is so very nice!
I’d so very like to trade Pokémon with you!
I’d so very like to trade this Eevee that I brought\nall the way from the Sinnoh region with one of\r\nyour Pokémon!
The time has come for Mr. Backlot’s\nPokémon to shine in the Kalos region!
Oh. I’m so very shocked...
When I feel like slacking off, it’s my\npolicy to stay in bed.
If you’d like to trade, you need to have\nat least two Pokémon with you.
Actually, it’s a Pokémon that I’d so\nvery like to trade for!
I’m traveling the land to learn more\nabout strong Trainers.
First, I think I’ll head over to Santalune City\nand then Cyllage City.
There’s a lot to be excited about when it comes\nto the strong Trainers of the Kalos region!
I know a whole lot about strong Trainers!
Which Trainer do you want to\nknow about?
Viola

Valerie...\c\nWhat to call her? Miss Valerie? Lady Valerie?\nShe definitely needs some kind of title.\c\nOh, never mind my rambling!\c\nShe’s a fashion designer from the Johto region and\nalso happens to be the Gym Leader of Laverre City!\c\nShe’s also got this certain mysterious charm about\nher that’s really hard to put into words!
Lady Olympia!\c\nA mystery wrapped in an enigma! Little is known\nabout the Gym Leader of Anistar City.\c\nOne thing is for sure, though--she’s second to\nnone when it comes to fortune-telling!\c\nWhether it’s predicting one’s love prospects or\nthe fate of a corporation, she nails it every time!

Today is Monday!\c\nI’m going to help you shift gears and perk right up\nby giving your Pokémon an Alert Ribbon!
When you’re all perked up, everything goes well!\c\nIf you’re feeling down, just take a gander at\nan Alert Ribbon, and you’ll feel better in no time!

Finally, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\nWhat took you so long?\c\nGuess what!\c\nMr. Looker is getting\nout of the hospital! Finally!\c\nI wanted us all to be here\nto welcome him home!
Murrr-murrrrrr...
Oh! Mimi, you’re back!\c\nCome on, Mimi! You’re part\nof the welcome party, too!
Mrawr! Murrr-rrrawr!
Huh? What’s wrong with Mimi?\c\nI think it’s holding something...
Mrrrawr!
It’s...a letter?\c\nIt’s from Mr. Looker.\c\n[VAR TRNAME(0000)]...\nI’ll read it out loud, OK?
“To my dearest friends...\nI must have but a moment of your time.\c\nIt is I, the great detective Looker.\c\nI write today because there is\nsomething I must confess to you.\c\nThis is confidential! Top secret!\c\nI am not a private detective at all but\nan officer of the International Police!\c\nYou are shocked, of course. My hard-boiled\ndetective act was brilliantly flawless, after all.\c\nBut I know you have been worrying about\nmy long ‘hospital stay’ and the strange\r\n‘illness’ that kept me there.\c\nThe truth is--I am the very picture of health!\c\nMy hospital stay was a ruse to\nkeep you all out of harm’s way.\c\nMy intentions were only the best, but it\nwas still a lie, for which I humbly apologize.”
“However, my friends, there\nis another reason for this letter.\c\nAnd so I must request of you\njust a minute or two more.\c\nI came to this region for an investigation.\nDetective Officer Looker was on the case!\c\nAnd, indeed...\nThanks to yours truly, the case is now closed.\c\nMy greatness prevailed! I cheer! And yet...\nIt also means my time in Kalos is done.\c\nI must say good-bye to this lovely region.\nAnd, more painfully, to you, my friends.\c\nThank you for all your assistance...\nAnd adieu.\c\nP.S. To [VAR TRNAME(0000)], my colleague...\c\nYou have been the perfect partner.\c\nFor all that you have done for me in\nour time together, I would like to present\r\nyou with my cherished code name, ‘Looker.’\c\nAnd for Emma and Mimi...\c\nTo the two of you, I leave the Looker Bureau.\nI purchased the whole building, so never\r\nagain will you have to worry about rent.\r\nIt is now yours to do with as you will.”
Wh-what is this...\nIs he joking?\c\nWhat’s this “International Police”?\c\nH-he wouldn’t go and leave us,\nwould he? Why...?\c\nCould he leave without even\nsaying a word to us?!\c\nIt can’t be...\nHe can’t go...\c\nI don’t want him to go\noff somewhere without us!\c\nHe can’t have gotten far yet, right?\c\n[VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\nI’m going after him!
Mrrraaawwwrrr!!!
Wotcher! How’s it going, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]?\nI was bored, so I came over!
Eh, when I was comin’ in just now,\nEmma were tearin’ out in a hurry!\c\nSomethink happenin’?
Now you’re gonna up and leave, too?!\c\nI came all the way over here to visit!\nWhy you all gotta be so cold like that?\c\nAn’ even old man Looker!\c\nWhen I just ran into him, he said he had\nto go to the Lumiose Museum and totally\r\nblew me off without another word!
Gah, I’m bored outta me skull.\nHappen I shoulda gone to the museum\r\nwith our Looker, after all...
LOOKER’S NOTEBOOK\nTo [VAR TRNAME(0000)], my friend--\c\nI imagine that you must have read the letter\nI entrusted to Mimi by now.\c\nHere, in my private notes, I must express\nto you my gratitude and my regrets.\c\nMy greatest regret is that I had to lie to you,\nmy worthy partner.\c\nIn adherence to the guidelines of the\nInternational Police, I was strictly\r\nforbidden to reveal my identity.\c\nBut I am grateful from the bottom of my heart\nthat you were my partner.\c\nOur time together was brief, but I will treasure\nthe memories of working with you for always.
As I wrote in the letter, my task here is complete.\c\nI must escort the suspected criminal Xerosic to\nhis trial and bid farewell to this land.\c\nI’m sure Emma must be distraught, but I know\nyou of all people will understand why I must go.\r\nYou are my partner, after all.\c\nThank you for working at my side.\c\n                                          Ever your partner,\n                                                  Looker
Oh! You’re that curious young\n[VAR GENDBR(00FF,0403)]manlady who came the last time...\c\nWell, the repairs to that mural\nhave been completed now.\c\nAnd the police officer who just\nleft told me that the suspect\r\nhas been apprehended.
Oh! You’re that same kid who\ncame before to see the mural!\c\nThe criminal responsible was\ncaught--did you know?\c\nI overheard the director of the\nmuseum talking with the police!\c\nBut still...it sure was odd...\c\nWhy do you think that police\nofficer looked so sad when he\r\nwalked out of here?
I’m telling you I gave them back!\nEvery last one of them!
...Fine.\c\nIf you really say that you returned all\nthe Poké Balls that Essentia stole...
And I did! I returned them!\c\nAnd I’m turning myself in without\na fight, so just give me a minute!
There is no minute to give you!\nOur train is about to depart!
Haha! Here they come!
What? [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\nWh-why are you here?!
Because I contacted\nEmma, of course!\c\nI’m sure she’ll be here\nany minute, too!
Where is he? Hold on!\nWait for me, Mr. Looker!
Good timing, Emma!
Oh, Dr. Xerosic!\nThanks for your message!
Mr. Looker, I’ve been searching\neverywhere for you!\c\nPlease t-tell me why, please...\c\nWhy did you lie to us?\nWhy are you leaving us behind?
I...I’m sorry, Emma...\nBut my letter explains everything.\c\nI work for the International Police!\nI am a globe-trotting, crime-fighting elite!\r\nWherever there is a case, I must go!\r\nJustice awaits!
Then take me and Mimi with you.\nWe’ll join whatever police!\c\nWe can be police or anything--\nif only we can just stay together!
Emma, I wish it could be like that.\c\nYou can’t come. It’s not possible at all.
Why not?! Why can’t we?!\c\nI’m part of the Looker Bureau, too!\nI’m your assistant, aren’t I?!
In fact, the time has come for you to\ngraduate from being my assistant.\c\nAs of this moment, I name you the\nnew head of the Looker Bureau!
Wh-what?
Listen to me, Emma.\c\nYou were born and raised in this fair city.\nEvery day of your life, you have been here.\c\nYou are the only one who knows this\ncity inside and out. No one else could\r\ndo the things you can do for it!\c\nI pass my torch of brilliant detective-ing\nto you! Take my place, and keep\r\nprotecting the peace of Lumiose City!
But that’s not fair at all!
Come on, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\nSay something! Tell him he’s wrong!
Emma, please. I must ask you to\nrespect the necessity of my decision.\c\n[VAR TRNAME(0000)] understands\nperfectly why I must go.\c\nIt is the way of partners. [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0201)]HShe is my\npartner. We understand each other.
Mrrrawrrr...
Oh, Mimi...\c\nPlease don’t make a\nsad face on my account.\c\nNo matter where I go,\nour bonds will never change.\c\nYou will be my dear friends from the\nLooker Bureau, always and forever.
Yes! That is it! Bonds!\c\nThe preposterous notion which\ncannot be seen nor measured!\c\nAnd yet I cannot deny that they\ndo still exist!\c\nFear not, Emma, for I suspect\nthat you will always be tied to the\r\nInternational Police by your bonds!
Dr. Xerosic...
Emma! I give you my Expansion Suit!\c\nI have removed the remote-control\nfunctionality, so you needn’t worry!\c\nAs the new head detective in town,\nplease use your powers as Essentia\r\nto protect your beloved Lumiose City!\c\nAnd...and...\c\nPlease take all of the Pokémon that I\nraised for so long! They are yours now!
Dr. Xerosic...\c\nDr. Xerosic, you’ve tried to do\nterrible things to the world, I guess.\c\nI find it hard to see you as that\nkind of person.\c\nI only became a Pokémon Trainer\nthanks to your being there for me.\c\n... ... ...\c\nI will always cherish your Pokémon\nand your suit, Dr. Xerosic.\c\nI won’t forget our bonds, either...
Everyone... I’m sorry, but...\nWe are nearly out of time.\r\nOur train is due to depart.
Mr. Looker...\nI think I understand...\c\nAnd I know what I’m gonna do.\nI’ll keep on working hard for you.\c\nI’ve got Mimi and [VAR TRNAME(0000)]\nto help me. With Dr. Xerosic’s Pokémon\r\nand Expansion Suit, I will become the new\r\nhead of the Looker Bureau!
I leave it in your hands, Emma!\c\nI’ll rest easy, knowing you’re on the case!
Emma!\nDon’t you mess this up, my girl!
Ahem...\c\n[VAR TRNAME(0000)]! Emma! Mimi!\c\nI entrust to you three the great task of\nprotecting the peace of Lumiose City!
Thank you for everything!\nFarewell, my friends!
Thank you... And good-bye...
That’s enough...
Muuurrrawr...
Hey, Mimi?\c\nYou know, we’ve made a lot of really\ngood friends since we left the alleys...\c\nM[VAR GENDBR(00FF,0302)]r.iss [VAR TRNAME(0000)] and Mr. Looker...\nAnd Dr. Xerosic, too...
Mrawr! Mrawwwr!
Mimi...\c\nThose two old guys really\ndid everything for us...\c\nDo you think that’s what\nit’s like...to have a father?
Mrawr?
Hehehe...\c\nNothing. Never mind.\c\nOf course you wouldn’t know\nany better than me, Mimi.\c\nBut...I’m still glad.\nI’m glad we got to meet them.
Mrrrrrrawr! 
You got a message on your Holo Caster!
Oh! [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\nHow’re you doing?\c\nWe’ve got no new cases in\nthe Looker Bureau today!\c\nI was thinking of going for a\nwalk with Mimi, but what if a\r\nclient came while I was gone?\c\nDo you think you could hold\ndown the fort for a while?
Hehehe... Thank you, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].\nYou’re always so sweet.\c\nBut never mind--I think I’ll\nstay in. I can take a walk later.\c\nMr. Looker entrusted me\nwith the Looker Bureau, and\r\nI’ve got to be a good head!
Oh, really?\nO-of course... I see...\c\nYou’re a really busy person,\nof course. Right, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]?\c\nSorry for asking too much.\nJust forget about it, OK?\c\nBut don’t forget that you are\nalso part of the Looker Bureau!\c\nSo feel free to drop by for a\nvisit any time!

Oh! You actually showed up!
Hey, [VAR TRNAME(0000)], I was\nhoping to find Mr. Looker.\c\nI’ve been so busy lately that\nI’m hardly ever here anymore.\c\nDo you have any idea where he is?
Wha...?\nHe’s in the hospital?!\c\nWhat’s wrong with him?\nNow I’m even more\r\nworried than before!\c\nB-but...\c\nI’d need more money\nto get to the hospital...
Ah! Is that the time?!\nI’m gonna be late!\c\nI gotta go, Mimi!\nWe’ll talk later, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!
Murrr-murrrawr!
Please pardon my intrusion...\c\nWould I be correct to assume that\nthis is the Looker Bureau and that\r\nyou might be M[VAR GENDBR(0000,0305)]asteriss [VAR TRNAME(0000)]?
I am terribly sorry to intrude upon\nyou, but I have a request. But\c\nbefore we discuss the reason for\nmy visit today, would you allow me\r\nto verify your strength, M[VAR GENDBR(0000,0305)]asteriss [VAR TRNAME(0000)]?
As expected, the confidence\nof a Champion is unshakable.\c\nPlease allow me to begin\nthe battle at once!
Oh? Does even a Champion\nneed time to prepare?\c\nI shall wait here until you\nare ready. Please do hurry.
Yes, as I suspected...\c\nYour abilities and strength are\nwithout peer, M[VAR GENDBR(0000,0305)]asteriss [VAR TRNAME(0000)].\c\nEven I, a former admin of Team Flare,\nhad no chance against you.\c\nPlease forgive me for testing you.\nI am a mere servant, sent here\r\nby order of my mistress.\c\nShe told me to measure your skill,\nand to proceed only if\r\nI judged you to be able.
Oh goodness! Look at the time!\c\nMy mistress is not a patient woman!\nIf she is made to wait too long,\r\nthe consequences will be severe.\c\nPlease, M[VAR GENDBR(0000,0305)]asteriss [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\nYou must hurry to Hotel Richissime’s\r\nRoyal Suite at once!
LOOKER’S TOP-SECRET JOURNAL\n･ The XXth day of the XXth month...\c\nI have at last succeeded in\napproaching the detestable contact.\c\nIt must be said that the personality\nof this contact is formidable.\r\nThis will not be an easy task.\c\nI may have to give a promise of amnesty\nto secure help from such a vile individual.
Took you long enough, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].\c\nIt may happen that I have need of your\nservices, but I expect you to keep in\r\nmind how valuable my time is!
Oh, never mind! Just fight me!\c\nI can’t possibly have a reasonable discussion\nwhen my emotions are so inflamed!
I’m burning up with rage!
You’re only adding fuel to the fire!
Enough for now.\c\nI brought you here for a reason.\c\nThe first issue is the identity\nof the Trainer called Essentia.\c\nIn truth, she is simply a young\ngirl called Emma, wearing\r\na piece of special technology\r\ndubbed the Expansion Suit.\c\nThe Expansion Suit was\ncreated by Dr. Xerosic.\c\nI can see that name means\nsomething to you.\c\nYou remember him, I take it.\n...One of Team Flare’s scientists.
This brings me to my request, young [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0403)]manlady.\nMake sure Xerosic disappears.\c\nI don’t care how. If you need a reason,\ncall it honor among thieves...\c\nEven we in Team Flare\nhad our sense of pride.\c\nYou may have disagreed with us, but\nwe were doing what we thought right.\r\nI won’t let him sully our honor now.\c\nThe hero of Kalos would hardly wish\nfor that girl Emma to keep staining her\r\nhands with these crimes as Essentia.\c\nIf you want to help the girl, you\nneed to put a stop to Xerosic.\c\nAnd that I can help you with!
If we leave now, we should find him at\nLysandre Café. Don’t dawdle.\c\nBe ready to face death if you go.\nPrepare well if you want a shot at surviving.
Oh my. Aren’t you a speedy one?\c\nScore one for you.\nI do so hate to be kept waiting.\c\nCome on. I’ll show you the way.
You’ll find Xerosic in the lab.\c\nIt’s a secret floor that only\ncertain admins know about.
You’ll need to take the elevator.\c\nI’ll just enter the special password\non this panel here...
And voilà!\c\nNow you have access to the\nsecret floor of Lysandre Labs.\c\nYou should find Xerosic\nand his Essentia there.\c\nThe rest I leave to you.\c\nThe secret floor has the\nsame layout as this one.\c\nYou defeated Team Flare\nonce, right? Then this should\r\nbe a piece of cake.\c\nOh. And one last thing...\c\nTell that partner of yours...\c\nTell that infuriating man...\c\nYes, tell him I fulfilled my\nend of the bargain.\c\nAnd he should keep in mind\nwhat will happen to him if\r\nhe doesn’t do the same.\c\nGood day.
There are obstacles blocking the way.
If it ain’t [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\nWhat’s cookin’?\c\nEh? That’s yer line? Heh.\nWell, I got onto a part-time\r\njob as a security guard. See?\c\nEmma got us in with the\nboss of here. But I dunno\r\nwhy they want a guard.\c\nAin’t seen hide nor hair o’ nothin’!\nRight bored, I am.
Hey, how ’bout we have a little\nbattle to keep me on my toes?
Right! I’ll give it my all!\nYer better not expect another\r\neasy win like that time at the station!
Oi, seriously, mate? Lame.\c\nI’m that bored. Look ’ere, if yer win,\nI’ll tell yer somethin’ epic.
Man, I lost in no time flat!\nYer somethin’, that’s for true.\c\nIt was fun while it lasted, but\nit’s still a long grind till my\r\nshift ends, y’know?
Allow as I’ve an idea...\nC’mere a sec!
’Ere we are, yo!\c\nNobody’s supposed to be allowed\nin, y’know?\c\nWhich makes yer think there’s bound\nto be somethin’ epic locked up\r\nin ’ere, eh? Stands to reason.\c\nI ain’t got nothin’ goin’ on at the moment,\nso let’s be havin’ us a little look-see\r\nfor stacks of treasures.
What’s good, my friend?\nFind anythin’ yet?\c\nMaybe hidden on those\nbookshelves or suchlike?\c\nThere’s gotta be somethin’!\nCheck out every corner!
[~ 32]
Hi, where’s the hurry?\c\nKeep me company, c’mon.\nIt gets so borin’ down here!
Ermh...\c\nSo there’s just Poké Balls\nan’ papers, like?\c\nThose Poké Balls got to belong\nto somebody, stands to reason.\c\nI promised Mr. Looker, an’\nwhat’s more, I meant it.\c\nI won’t never take Poké Balls\nthat aren’t mine!
Waugh, my shift’s finally endin’!\nI’m out, see? Later, [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0102)]brluv!\c\nBe sure an’ shut the place\nwhen you go, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!
EXPANSION SUIT SPECS\n1. Physical Enhancement\c\nHeightens physical abilities of the wearer\nwith built-in muscle-enhancing technology.\c\n2. Poké Ball Jack\c\nA hacking cable on the neck piece allows\nthe wearer to upload a computer virus to\r\nPoké Balls and override their systems.\c\nThis provides access to control the Pokémon.\c\nThe virus also magnifies the Pokémon’s power.
3. Surface Texturing\c\nOptically disguises the wearer, based on\nthe current understanding of Kecleon and\r\nDitto’s physical transformations.\c\n4. Remote Control\c\nRemote control of the suit protects against\nthe risk of its wearer going renegade.\c\nAI personalities are preprogrammed,\nmodeled on common Trainer types.\c\nWhen the suit is controlled remotely,\nthe wearer’s consciousness is suppressed.\r\nThe wearer experiences a coma-like state.
Expansion Suit Field Trials\nSecret Records: Volume 1\c\nThe XXth day of the XXth month...\c\nPosted an advertisement for part-time\nwork at the Lysandre Café to recruit\r\na test subject for the suit’s field trials.\c\nThe Expansion Suit should make even\nan average Trainer into a superhuman\r\nforce, a force to be reckoned with...\c\nIt is the ultimate result of my life’s study--\nmy magnum opus.\c\nThe trials must be a success!\c\nI wait on the appearance of a young,\nhealthy, and ambitious test subject.
Expansion Suit Field Trials\nSecret Records: Volume 2\c\nThe XXth day of the XXth month...\c\nAt long last, a response came to my\nadvertisement for part-time work.\c\nThe subject’s name is Emma.\nShe is a healthy girl, 16 years of age.\c\nWhen I attempted to explain the intent\nof my research, she gave little sign\r\nof understanding.\c\nShe does appear to understand the passion\nI have put into the suit research, and she\r\nshowed interest in continuing with the trials.\c\nNow that Team Flare has been disbanded,\nmy funds are running severely low.
I hired her on the spot.\nThe trials must proceed with no time lost.\c\nFirst, I’ll measure Emma’s physical and mental\nabilities to ensure she can complete the trials.\c\nThe XXth day of the XXth month...\c\nI have customized the suit to better\nfit Emma’s frame.\c\nThe XXth day of the XXth month...\c\nI have designated the code name Essentia\nto be used when Emma is wearing the\r\nExpansion Suit.
Expansion Suit Field Trials\nSecret Records: Volume 3\c\nThe XXth day of the XXth month...\c\nAs we make final preparations for the trials,\na new trouble strikes.\c\nI have learned that Emma has no\nexperience as a Pokémon Trainer!\c\nWith little other choice, I am forced\nto instruct the girl on all the basics.
The XXth day of the XXth month...\c\nI have lent Emma my own Pokémon\nand am instructing her on the skills\r\nneeded in a Pokémon Trainer.\c\nHowever, my Pokémon seem only\nto wish to play with the girl.\c\nThey show no desire to engage in battle.\nTheir behavior is most puzzling.\c\nThey have never shown signs of being\nparticularly friendly nor reluctant to battle.\c\nTheir playfulness is a detriment to the trials.\nI will have to control the suit remotely in order\r\nto have any chance of starting the trials in time.
Expansion Suit Field Trials\nSecret Records: Volume 4\c\nThe XXth day of the XXth month...\c\nFinally, the trials are underway.\c\nThe first trial is designed to test\nthe suit’s physical capabilities.\c\nUsing the texturing function,\nthe subject has infiltrated the\r\nclosely guarded art museum and\r\nleft an insignia on a historical mural.
The remote-control function has worked\nwithout complications thus far.\c\nEmma shows no ill effects from her\ntime in the suit. Her memory is blank.\c\nWhen questioned, she describes her\nexperience as “taking a nap.”\c\nPerhaps I will give her a bonus in\ncelebration of this successful trial.
Expansion Suit Field Trials\nSecret Records: Volume 5\c\nThe XXth day of the XXth month...\c\nTrials begin of a key part of the Expansion Suit:\nthe hacking cable I’ve called the Poké Ball Jack.\c\nWith the texturing function enabled, the\nsubject battles Trainers around the city.\c\nShe then collects the Poké Balls from Trainers she\ndefeats, so that we may use them in our tests.\c\nThe results of the tests have been\nquite favorable thus far.\c\nHowever, these trials have not\nbeen entirely free from incident.\c\nSome apparent acquaintances of Emma’s\nare proving to be a hindrance to our progress.
Among these acquaintances is a [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0403)]boygirl\nwho appears to be the new Champion,\r\nbut this is not yet confirmed.\c\nWe encountered a glitch in the remote-control\nprogramming, and I lost control for a brief period.\c\nFearing possible effects on Emma,\nI suspended the trials temporarily.\c\nWhen we returned to the secret base,\nI examined the girl for signs of damage,\r\nbut she appeared to be unharmed.\c\nShe still retains no memories from\nher intervals in the suit.\c\nThe one thing she admitted was experiencing\n“a frightful dream.”
It’s someone’s Poké Ball.
Hmm...\c\nWhy did the remote control\nmalfunction only that one time?
Do I need to do more than simply\nput her in a state of sleep?\r\nMust I subdue her spirit, too?\c\nNo, no. Doing that would put far too\ngreat a strain upon Emma’s mind...
Oho ho ho!\nYou’re the [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0403)]boygirl from the glitched trial!\c\nYou’ve been interfering with my research!\c\nVery well. You will be the next\nsubject for my trials!\c\nIf Essentia can defeat you in the\nExpansion Suit, that is all the proof\r\nnecessary to show that my research\r\nhas been correct from the start!\c\nCome, Essentia!
... ... ...
Now, battle!\nBattle, my Essentia!
POKÉ BALL JACK FUNCTION INITIATED.\nVIRUS POTENCY SET TO 60 PERCENT.
Astonishing!\nMore than satisfactory!\c\nBut Essentia’s skills\ngo far beyond this!\c\nNow, battle!\nBattle on, my Essentia!
POKÉ BALL JACK FUNCTION INITIATED.\nVIRUS POTENCY SET TO 70 PERCENT.
Wonderful!\nMagnificent!\c\nBut Essentia is only\ngetting started!\c\nNow, battle!\nBattle on, my Essentia!
POKÉ BALL JACK FUNCTION INITIATED.\nVIRUS POTENCY SET TO 80 PERCENT.
Come, come, we can still go on!\nOr are you worn out?\c\nToo bad that Essentia will never\nexperience physical or mental\c\nfatigue as long as she wears the\nExpansion Suit that I designed!\c\nNow, battle!\nBattle on, my Essentia!
Mrrraaawwwrrr!!
Wha--?!
That is enough.
What?!
Who are you two?\nWhy are you here?
Mimi is a Psychic-type Pokémon.\c\nIt is only natural that it could find the\nfriend to whom it has opened its heart.
You can’t just barge into a private\nresidence like this! This is a crime!
That may have been true had we\nforced our way onto the property.\c\nHowever, all we did was step\ninto a wide-open elevator.\c\nNotwithstanding that, [VAR TRNAME(0000)] is\nthe partner of the great Looker!\c\nWere [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0100)]she in trouble, I would follow to the\nhighest heights and the fathomless depths!
Grrr...\c\nStill, you will not capture me!\c\nGo, Essentia! Get them all!
... ... ...
Stop this, Emma!
Mrrrrrrawr!
It’s useless, you fools!\c\nNothing you try will work!\nEmma cannot hear you!\c\nThe one in control of Essentia\nis not Emma, but me!
Can you hear me, Emma?!\c\nIf you can wake yourself, I know\nyou can break free of that suit!\c\nAwaken! Open your eyes!\c\nEmma! EMMA!!
... ... ...
Isn’t the power of science amazing?\nThere’s no way she will hear you now!
Murrr-mrrraaawr!!\nMurrr-mrrraaawr!!
Mimi! Get back!
Mrawr?!
... ... ...Ugh!
UWAAAUUUGGGHHH!!
What?! How can this be happening?\c\nNot a problem, though. Watch this!\c\nRemote-control function...\nSet to maximum output!
Ugh! [VAR TRNAME(0000)]! You must go!\c\nStop Emma for me!
Stop Emma for me!\c\nThis is all I am able to do!\nPlease aid me!
Mrrraaawwwrrr-rawr!
Uwaugh!!!
... ... ...Ngh!\c\nGAAAAAHHH!!
There are no more Poké Balls!\nYou must stop fighting!! EMMA!!!
... ... ...
GRAAAUUUGGGHHH! AUUUGGGHHH!!
No... Emma!\nWhat can I do?!
... ... ...
AAAUUUGGGHHHHH!!
Remote control...\nPower down. Deactivate.
GAAAHHH!!
... ... ...
E-Emma!!\nAre you all right?!
... ... ...
All I did was turn off the\nremote-control capability.\c\nThere was never any\ndanger to the girl.
What?!
Mmh...\c\nMmm... Yawwwn!\c\nHm?\c\nOh, Dr. Xerosic...\c\nAre we all done for today?
Yes, my girl... We’re done...\nYou did a good job, Emma.\c\nThe trials are now complete.\nI’m afraid your job is all over.
Yawwwn! Oh, really?\c\nThen I guess I’ve got to start\nlooking for a new job again.
Huh? Wait?\nWhy is everyone here?\c\nI thought it was a secret\nthat I was working here!
E-Emma...\nAre you...all right?
Hm? What do you mean?\nI’ve just been taking a nap.\c\nMy job here was really easy.\nAll I had to do was wear this\r\nsuit while I snoozed away.
What are you doing here, Mr. Looker?\nI thought you were in the hospital!
Uh... Ahem. N-no...\c\nYou see...I got, uh, special permission\nto check myself out of the...hospital...\c\nI had to make sure you were OK, Emma.\c\nI had to see you, so I found out where\nyou worked and came to find you.
Oh, I see.\nI was afraid you might be mad because\r\nI started working without telling you.\r\nI kept it a secret all this time...\c\nYou really are a great detective, aren’t you,\nMr. Looker? You found me anyway!
Naturally!\c\nNow, Emma, how about you\ngo and get some dinner?\c\nI need to have a little grown-up\ntalk with Dr. Xerosic here!
Oh, sure. No problem!\nWe’ll head out now!\c\nLet’s all go together! Mimi!\nAnd you, too, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!
That may be that...but...\c\nI think it’s time you and I have\na little chat, Dr. Xerosic.
Of course. Why would I mind\nhaving a chat with you...“Looker,”\r\nor so you’re apparently called.
Ahem. Let us get down to it.\c\nI would like to straighten this out\nbefore Emma returns.\c\nDr. Xerosic, could you please\nconfirm one small thing for me?\c\nThe criminal mastermind behind all\nthese incidents was--you yourself?
Oho. Right enough.\c\nThe graffiti in the art museum and\nthe theft of the Trainers’ Poké Balls?\c\nAll me, controlling Essentia\nremotely with the Expansion Suit!\c\nEmma was clinically unconscious\nin the suit. Her mind had no clue\r\nwhat her body was doing.\c\nShe has zero responsibility for any of\nthe crimes. You need not doubt her.
That’s how it is?
If you’re apprehending anyone,\nit should be me alone.
Ahem. For a minute, let’s say\nI believe your statements--
You had better believe it.\c\nEmma is a fine person.\nShe may be a bit foolish, but\r\nshe’s strong and clear in purpose.\c\nYes, clarity...\c\nIt is required when one dedicates\noneself to a single pursuit.\c\nClarity of heart and of purpose is needed\nif work such as my research is to succeed.\c\nThe Expansion Suit that I dreamed\nof could have only been created thanks\r\nto the clear dedication of that girl’s heart.\c\nWhen you add that all up, it means...\nThat I have no regrets.\c\nTake me away, Officer.
I hear you.\c\nOnce I have everything in order, I will\nask you to accompany me to the station.\c\nAnd that is all I have to say to you as\nLooker of the International Police.\c\nWhat I say to you now, I say as simply\nMr. Looker, young Emma’s guardian...
Hm?
Would you care to stay and visit a\nwhile longer with Emma and me?\c\nShe seems to have grown\nquite fond of you, you know.\c\nWe are about to have dinner together,\nand she was hoping you would join us.\c\nAhem...\c\nI would like to wait until tomorrow, after\nshe has enjoyed a last cheerful night,\r\nbefore I must tell her the truth.
... ... ...
Dr. Xerosic...
... ... ...\n... ... ...\r\nLooker--or whatever your name truly is--\r\nyour soft words are unexpected...\c\nBut not unappreciated. Th-thanks.
Um-hm... That Mr. Looker!\c\nHe said his stomach is still paining\nhim too much to check out yet!\c\nI wonder if this time he’ll tell me\nwhich hospital he’s at.\c\nI’ve never even visited him once!\c\nAnd it seems like Mr. Xerosic\nis busy, too, what with getting\r\nready for his big arrest and all.\c\nI gotta say it’s a bit, well, lonesome\naround here at the office, really...
Mrawwr Mrrrawrrr!

Ah, [VAR TRNAME(0000)], thank you so much\nfor your time. I need three minutes only.\c\nEmma is on my mind. Recently, she has\nbeen running off somewhere on her own.\r\nAnd often.\c\nI was hoping to ask her to watch the\noffice for me today, and once again,\r\nnowhere can she be found.\c\nIt even seems as if she did\nnot return here last night...\c\nHer friends from the former gang\nseem to be on the straight and narrow,\r\nso I hope this is not anything bad, but...
Hm? What’s this?\nA Holo Caster clip?
Did you see that, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]?!\nWhere trouble goes, Looker must follow!\c\nI am on my way to the Lumiose Museum\nto begin my investigations! Most urgently!\c\nIt is straight to the scene of the crime for us!\c\n...Oh, wouldn’t it be nice if that were true?\c\nBut I actually have an appointment soon that\nI cannot possibly miss, so I am stuck here...\c\nI hate to ask this of you, but I need you to start\nthe investigation without me, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!
I will be counting on your\nkeen eyes, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\c\nGo at once to the Lumiose Museum\non North Boulevard, and get to the\r\nbottom of this mess!
LOOKER’S TOP-SECRET JOURNAL\n･ The XXth day of the XXth month...\c\nEmma has been going out more and more often.\nI find it worrying, not knowing where she goes.\r\nIs this perhaps how a father feels?\c\n･ The XXth day of the XXth month...\c\nThe young people from the gang came by to tell\nus that they had secured part-time work.\c\nI’ve never worked within the Community Safety\nDepartment, but even I do feel quite moved to\r\nsee young people turning their lives around.
LOOKER’S NOTEBOOK\nRecent Headlines\c\n★ A vandal has damaged valuable\nartwork at the Lumiose Museum
Hey, kid! Listen to this!\c\nYou’ve got some timing, picking today\nof all days to come to the museum...\c\nOr are you here because you heard\nabout what happened?
Someone went and left some crazy\ngraffiti on a piece on the third floor!\c\nSome kind of depraved criminal, I guess,\nsabotaging a historic and valuable artwork!\c\nYou know, this place is supposed to\nhave the strictest security. I wonder\r\nhow a criminal would get access...
Head up to the top floor,\nand you can see the outrage.\c\nBelieve me, it’s unbelievable.\nThe museum director’s up there, too.\c\nMaybe he can tell you more.
...Mm-hmm.
I am the museum director.\c\nMay I ask you a question, young [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0403)]manlady?\c\nWhen you behold this graffiti,\nwhat feelings rise up within you?\c\nDo you feel that the value of this\nglorious work of art has been affected?\r\nDoes it seem too, too sullied to you?
Hmm... Yes, I can understand that.\c\nThat would be the common opinion,\nwould it not?\c\nDefacing a historical piece with graffiti...\c\nDefacing the history embodied by this\ngreat work of art!\r\nConsider the effort and pains of the artist...\c\nWell, it is simply profane to have\ntreated this work so savagely!
Hmm... Yes, I can appreciate that.\nAllow me a further question.\c\nDo you think that this graffiti itself is art?\nIs it worthy of similar regard?
Mm-hmm... Yes, I see...\c\nThe truth is that I feel the\nsame way you do, young [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0403)]manlady.\c\nThe violence of these lines...\c\nThe dark humor with which they\nseem to scorn recorded history,\r\ndefying its conventional narrative.\c\nIt forces me to think: “Is this not art\nalso? Is this statement truly a crime?”\c\nAs the museum director, I cannot say\nsuch things publicly about what most\r\nconsider the ruination of a great work.
The problem is what to do now.\nTrying to restore the original\r\nwork may worsen the damage.\c\nI think we will have to leave it\nas it is until we can decide.\c\nI suppose if the news brings curious\ncitizens like yourself to our doors,\r\nthat is something of a silver lining.\c\nBut who could be responsible\nfor this shocking work?
[VAR TRNAME(0000)], have you seen the news?\nThe purloining of Pokémon continues!\c\nIt is unforgivable! We have not yet\nclosed the case at the museum, but...\c\nWhen you consider how many are\nsuffering, we must pursue the culprits!\c\nI have devised an absolutely amazing plan\nthat will bring an immediate solution.
It will be a sting operation!\c\nIt appears the criminals are\ntargeting Trainers in places\r\nwhere there are no witnesses.\c\nIf that is indeed the case, then\nwe can simply bait a trap and wait!
First the “victim” will go to some\ndeserted location and act lost.\c\nThe criminals will think they’ve\nfound an easy mark, and they\r\nwill surely reveal themselves!\c\nAll the reports say they like to\nchallenge their victims to battle\r\nbefore stealing their Pokémon.\c\nThat’s when we’ll get them!\c\nRight when they are distracted\nby the heat of a Pokémon battle!\c\nThe backup, who will be hiding\nand watching, will appear and\r\nhelp take down the criminals!
Indeed. What do you think?\c\nIt is not without risk, but it’s\nquite the best plan we have!\c\nHowever!\c\nThe plan will never succeed\nwithout you, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!
Esteemed [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\nAid me in this!
No, my brave friend [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\nThat is not the answer I hoped to hear!\c\nI need the help of my partner if I wish\nto uphold the peace of Lumiose City!
Many thanks! I knew I could count on my\npartner. Now, as to our assignments...\c\nThere is little to decide, since you\nare aware that I have no Pokémon.\c\nYour role is therefore to play the\nvictim in our little sting operation.\c\nI will conceal myself in the shadows\nand watch for my opening to attack.\c\nKeep your Pokémon ready to spring\ninto battle when the criminals appear!
I ask myself how to draw these\nmiscreants into approaching us.\c\nWhat we need is a place in this bustling\ncity that is a little deserted, perhaps.\c\nA nice, neglected alley is exactly\nwhat I have in mind.\c\nCome, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]! The game is afoot!
Let us begin the hunt\nclose to home!\c\nThe nearest alley is opposite the\nGalette Stand on North Boulevard.\c\nGo quickly, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\c\nI will be right behind you!
Come, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\nThere is a time to hunt and a time to hide!\r\nAnd this is that time.\c\nTo the alley opposite the Galette Stand\non North Boulevard, at top speed!
LOOKER’S NOTEBOOK\nRecent Headlines\c\n★ A vandal has damaged valuable\nartwork at the Lumiose Museum\c\n★ Continuing thefts of Poké Balls\nfrom all around Lumiose City
Excuse me...\nAre you perhaps a Trainer?\c\nIf you have a moment, how\nabout a little battle with me?
I’m disappointed. And you looked strong, too.\nIs something the matter?\c\nIf you just need a little time to\nprepare, I would be happy to wait.
I am just itching for a good\nbattle... Let us begin at once!
Oh ho ho! You have some\nwonderfully strong Pokémon.\c\nI wonder, young [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0403)]manlady, if you wouldn’t consider...\ngiving them all to me!
Stop right there!
OBSTRUCTION DETECTED.\nPROCESS JEOPARDIZED.\r\nRELOCATE HUNTING GROUND.
Wha--?!\nWhat is that woman?!\c\nShe’s no Pokémon, yet\nshe can use Transform?\c\nOh, what am I doing?\c\nThis is not a time to stand\naround being shocked!\c\nIn fact, this is a time to dash off\nin pursuit! The chase is on!\c\nNow, considering the direction in\nwhich she ran, and the angle...hm...
[VAR TRNAME(0000)], my brave friend!\nI suspect she is headed for the alley\r\nbeside North Boulevard’s Café Triste!\c\nPlease go ahead without me! I will\nbe right behind you, just as soon as\r\nI have checked this place for clues!
But wait! One minute of your time!\c\nThe great Looker will restore your\nPokémon before you go!
I suspect she is headed for\nthe alley beside Café Triste\r\nover on North Boulevard!\c\nI will come just as soon as\nI check this place for clues!
Hiya! You’re a Trainer, right?\nHow about a Pokémon battle?
Really, no? But why-y-y-y-y?\nI can wait if you need a sec.\c\nWhy don’t you go get the very\nstrongest Pokémon you have?
I can’t wait to see which Pokémon\nyou use! Let’s have a great battle!
Wow, M[VAR GENDBR(00FF,0302)]r.iss Trainer, your\nPokémon are super strong!\c\nThey’re so awesome.\nI sure wish I had Pokémon like that.\r\nI could really do well with those Pokémon.\r\nIn fact...\r\nHand them over right now.
Not today, you crook!\nI will not allow it!
RECURRENT INTERFERENCE.
Argh! She has run off on us again!\nIs she really not a Pokémon?\r\nI’ve never seen a human jump like that...\c\nOh, what am I doing?\c\nThis is no time to stand around\nbeing impressed!\r\nNow is the time to chase the culprit!\c\nConsidering the direction she ran off...hmm...
Brave [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\c\nHer goal must be the alley opposite\nNorth Boulevard’s Lumiose Station!\c\nGo ahead without me! I will follow\nclose behind you, just as soon as\r\nI have checked this place for clues!
No, wait! Thirty seconds!\nHow could I forget twice?!\c\nLet me just restore your\nPokémon before you go!
Next is the alley opposite Lumiose\nStation on North Boulevard!\c\nI will come just as soon as\nI check this place for clues!
Ahhh... This pain in my chest...\nIs this what a broken heart feels like?
What is it? What has happened?\n[VAR TRNAME(0000)], my friend!
Come now... Young man...\nWhat has happened to you?
...It was over in a flash.\c\nI was training here in the alley\nwhen an enchanting young lady\r\nchallenged me to battle...\c\nAnd then she...
What did she do?
She utterly destroyed me!\c\nMy heart was stolen by those brunette locks\nand the intensity of those glittering eyes!\c\nAnd then she took them...\nMy precious Poké Balls...\r\nShe took them by force...\c\nArghh... The memory is enough\nto make me start crying again...
Argh! So we were too late...\c\nAnd where did the woman go?!
Sniffle...sniffle...\c\nShe went running off toward\nSouth Boulevard, I guess...\c\nUgh... What possessed that...\nsvelte siren...
South Boulevard, huh?
[VAR TRNAME(0000)]! There is only\none alley on South Boulevard!\c\nExactly and precisely the same alley\nwhere we first met Emma and Mimi!\c\nGo at top speed, if you please!\nI will do what I can for this poor man\r\nand then follow as quickly as I can!
There is only one alley to be\nfound on South Boulevard!\c\nIt is the exact same alley where we\nfirst met Emma and Mimi!\c\nGo there at once, my young\nfriend, and catch that criminal!
Those long, lovely legs hit me like\na chop to the back of the head...\c\nFeeling the pain of being stomped into\nthe ground by a pair of high heels...\c\nWhile her easy smile never slipped...\c\nArrrgh... Just remembering is\nenough to make me break down...
Welcome, welcome. Step right up.\nI didn’t expect you to show. But here you are.
Heh heh heh...\nLet’s get into it.
Oh? You’re scared to battle?\nAre you sure?
Heh heh heh... That’s right!\nNo running away! Let’s start!
You really do have some\nof the best Pokémon...\c\nSo why not give up already\nand hand them over to me?
RELINQUISH EVERY POKÉMON YOU POSSESS.\nCOOPERATE OR I WILL TAKE THEM BY FORCE.
Freeze!
Pokémon thief!\c\nI will not let you lay\na finger on my partner!
DO NOT OBSTRUCT ME.\nI WILL ERADICATE YOU.
Easy words, but not so easy to carry out!\c\nEven though I, the great Looker, have\nno Pokémon, I yet have my fists!\c\nI’m a trained expert.\nThe outlook for you is dismal.
Mrrraaawwwr!
M-Mimi?!\nWhy--?!
Mrrr-murrr!
Mrrrawwwrrr mrawr! 

Mimi! That woman is dangerous!\nMove away from her at once!
Mrrraaawwwrrr! \nMrrrawwwwwwrrr! 

How can this be?\c\nWhy would our Mimi\nact so friendly to...
It...cannot...be.\nIt cannot be so.
OBSTRUCTION...\nERADICATE OBSTRUCTION.
Mimi! Watch out!
Rrrrawwwrrr!
Augh!
Ughhh...
WHY DO YOU PROTECT THIS POKÉMON?\nI DO NOT UNDERSTAND YOUR PROCESS.

W-wait...\nStop this... Emma...
EMMA?
Th-that’s right... You are...\nYou are Emma. Is it not so?
... ... ...
Ungh...\nM-Mimi hates all adults...\c\nThe only person it loves...\nenough to make it jump for joy...\r\nis you, Emma...
I AM NOT AN EMMA.\nI AM ESSENTIA.
Eurgh... Essentia?\c\nYou cannot deceive me, Emma.\nYou may trick an ordinary human eye...\c\nBut you could never fake the bond\nbetween you and...Mimi...
Mrrrawwwr...
... ... ...
What is the matter with you, Emma?\nWhy would you do these things!\c\nIf you are in some sort of trouble,\ncould you not have shared it with me?
... ... ...
Emma!\nSAY SOMETHING!
... ... ...Ugh!
E-Emma?
AUUUGGGHHHHHHHHH!!
Emma! What’s wrong?!
MUST...DISCONTINUE...
Emma!
Mrrr-mrrrawwwrrrr!
Oh no...\nEmma...
Ahem... [VAR TRNAME(0000)], forgive me...\c\nIt seems that last hit...got to me...\c\nDo you think you could possibly...\nhelp me back to the office...
Thank you for your kindness, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].\nYour help has saved me again today.
Murrr-murrr...
Even the great Looker can\nbe taken down, as you see.\c\nThe injury to my stomach, a mere\ntrifle, not at all...cough, cough...painful.\c\nI may just pop by...the hospital...\c\nIt has been quite a busy day, in fact.\nPlease go home and rest yourself.
Mimi, could you give this to [VAR TRNAME(0000)]?\c\nI am about to embark on a\ndangerous investigation.\c\nI must venture upon this road alone,\nin order to preserve you all from harm.\c\nI will claim to be staying in the hospital...\nand use this chance to slip away...
Mraaawwwrrr!
Urrugh... My injuries may\nbe worse than I guessed...\c\nBut I must press on!\nI can’t let this slow me down.\c\nEssentia...\c\nI know without doubt\nthat she is Emma...\c\nThat suit she wears is most\nlikely the doing of that man...\c\nThe man I have come so far\nto hunt down.\c\nIf I fail to find and stop him,\nmy Emma might never...
I have no choice but to beg\nthe help of that despicable...
Mrrrawr...
Mimi is carrying a note.\nWould you like to read it?
“To my esteemed partner:\nIt is I, the great Looker.\c\nI must investigate certain matters in regard\nto the Essentia case, and so I must leave\r\nthe Looker Bureau for some time.\c\nWhile I am away on this important task,\nI would ask two favors of you.\c\nFirst, if you should somehow meet Emma,\nyou must pretend to know nothing\r\nof the recent incidents around town.”
“The other thing I ask is simply...\c\nShould Emma ever come to you asking where\nI have been all this long while...\r\nPlease tell her that I am in the hospital with\r\nsome minor complaint. She is not to worry.\c\nI know that this may seem an extreme request,\nbut I trust you to do the right thing.\c\n                                            Your partner,\n                                                Looker”

You’re here, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]! That is good.\nI need 30 seconds of your time, no more.\c\nIt is about our new friend, Emma.\c\nEver since she started living here at the office,\nI have detected some signs of stress in her.\c\nThis has caused me to worry.\c\nWhat do you think, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]?\nCould it be that there is something wrong?
Interesting, interesting...\nSo, has she confided in you?\c\nOr did you use some of the brilliant\ndetective skills you learned from my class?\c\nYou’re an approachable person, [VAR TRNAME(0000)],\nwhich encourages others to open up to you.\c\nYou know, when I first invited Emma\nto live here, my intention was to\r\nbecome a guardian to her.\c\nI promised to do everything for her as\na parent would.\c\nI...I do hope my feelings of responsibility\nare not burdening her.
Of course, of course!\c\nIf my partner says nothing is wrong,\nthen, indeed, nothing could be wrong.\c\nI was a little worried that living in a\nstrange place and studying all day\r\nmight be causing her stress...\c\nHah! But my concerns prove untrue.\c\nIt is just like a grim detective such as\nmyself to see mysteries in everything.
おねがいです！　たすけてください！\c\nたいせつな　ポケモンちゃんが\nぬすまれて　しまったんです！
Oho! What have we here?\nOne of our fair city’s famous tourists!\c\nFrom your manner of speaking, madame,\nI deduce that you have traveled far indeed!\c\nI am...Looker. What may I do for you?
わたしの　ことばが　わかるんですね\nああ　よかった！　たすかります！\c\nわたし　このくにの　ことばは\nヒアリングしか　できなくて！\c\nじつは　えきで　わたしの　たいせつな\nポケモンちゃんたちが　ぬすまれて！\c\nそれで　ここが　たんていじむしょ　だって\nきいたから　うかがったんですよ！\c\nどうか　おねがいします！\c\nいますぐ　わたしの　ポケモンちゃんを\nとりかえして　いただけませんか？
Ahem...\c\nMy dear lady... I am so terribly sorry,\nbut could you speak a bit less quickly?
すっ　すいません……\nでも　いそいでるんですよ！\c\nたいせつな　ポケモンちゃんを\nとりかえさないと　そこく　に\r\nかえることも　できません！\c\nひこうきの　じかん　だって\nせまって　きているんですよ！
Ahem...\c\nFrom what I can gather, it seems that\nthis lady has been given sore offense.\c\nAnd do you know why that would be,\n[VAR TRNAME(0000)], my friend?\c\nWell, thanks to my gift for languages--\nI’ve traveled all over the world, you know...\c\nIt seems she is highly offended that she has come\nas a guest and not yet been offered tea!\c\nYes! Case closed!
Which means, my friend, I must make\nhaste to obtain the requisite tea!\c\n[VAR TRNAME(0000)], please keep our guest\ncompany until my return from this vital mission.
ちょっと　なんなのよ！　あの　ひと！！\nぜんぜん　わかってないじゃない！\c\nわたしは　のんきに　おちゃ　なんて\nのんでる　ばあいでは　ないんです！\c\nはやく　ポケモンちゃんを　たすけて！
I’m home, Mr. Looker!
Mrrrawwrrr!
Oh! [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\nWelcome back!\c\nIs Mr. Looker out?\nAnd who’s this old lady?
ちょっと　なんなの　この　こ！\c\nオバサンなんて　しつれいねっ！！\nみなりが　きたない　にんげんは\r\nことば　まで　けがれているわね！\c\nさっき　でていった　ルッカー　とかいう\nバカな　おとこの　こども　かしら？
……ちょっと　オバサン\nなんて　こと　いうの……？\c\nあたしのことは　どうでも　いい……\c\nけど　ルッカーおじさん　のこと\nわるく　いうのは　ゆるさない……\c\n……それにさ　あたしが\nおじさんの　こどもの　わけ　ないよ\c\n……おじさんに　しつれい　だよ
まっ！？\c\nあなた　わたしの　ことばが　わかるの？
うん……　まあね……\nだいたいで　なんとなく　だけど\c\nこのまち　って　おそとに　いると\nいろんな　くにの　ことばで\r\nおはなし　してるのが　きこえるから\c\nいつのまにか　おぼえちゃったの
Hmm...\c\nIf we keep going like this, then [VAR TRNAME(0000)]\nis gonna be totally lost...\c\nAnd I don’t feel like opening up the\ntrash talk with this old lady again...
Hey, Mimi!\c\nHow about it? Do you think you\ncan help us out with your power?
Mrrrawwwr!
ああ……　よかったわ……\nことばが　つうじる　ひとが　いて\c\nさっきの　しつれいな　はつげんは\nどうか　ゆるしてください……\r\nきもちに　よゆうが　なかったんです\c\nいのちより　だいじな　ポケモンちゃんを\nぬすまれて　こんらん　してしまって……
Is this Mimi’s mystical power?\c\nSomehow you can hear the strange\nwoman’s thoughts in your head...\c\n... ... ...\c\nIt seems she feels sorry for saying\nrude things about Looker and Emma.\c\n... ... ...\c\nAnd the real reason she is so troubled is\nthat her precious Pokémon were stolen!
ふーん……\nで？　どこで　ぬすまれたの？
Is this Mimi’s mystical power?\c\nSomehow you can hear Emma’s\nthoughts in your head...\c\n... ... ...\c\nShe doesn’t think highly of the\ninsulting woman, that’s for sure.\c\n... ... ...\c\nIt seems she is still worried\nabout the stolen Pokémon.
このまちの　えきで！\c\nガラの　わるい　れんちゅうが\nあゆみよったら　つぎの　しゅんかんに\r\nバッグと　なかに　いれた\r\nボールが　ぬすまれました！

Is this Mimi’s mystical power?\c\nSomehow you can hear Emma’s\nthoughts in your head...\c\n... ... ...\c\nIt seems that Emma has some idea\nof who the man might have been...
I return! My apologies for the delay.\c\nI have obtained the finest quality tea,\nsince our guest obviously has exquisite taste!
Oho! Emma and Mimi are back as well!\nYes. Excellent timing all round.\c\nEmma, have you introduced yourself\nto our visitor from a faraway land?
Murrrr-mrrrawwwr. ♪
Your link to the others’ thoughts\nsuddenly disappears.\c\nIt seems Mimi’s mysterious power\nwas somehow interrupted.
Oh! What have we here? Mimi! Are you\nhappy to see me come home, too?\c\nWhy... I wondered if it would ever happen.\nI have won over the hard-boiled Mimi!
Um, Mr. Looker?\c\nThis old lady here says her Pokémon were stolen.\c\nI’d guess the thieves are still in Lumiose Station...
What’s that? What’s that you’re saying?\nThen it wasn’t tea that she was after?\r\nBut I bought this...fancy...expensive...\c\nNo! Hah! Never mind that!\nLet us focus on what is most important now!\c\nCome, my friends! We have a case!
Just a minute, Mr. Looker.
What is it, Emma? Didn’t you hear?\nHer Pokémon have been stolen!\c\nWe must get them back at once!
I’d bet anything that the guy who\nstole this old lady’s Pokémon\r\nwas part of the Lumiose Gang.\c\nThey’re rough types, you know?\c\nIf we stick our noses in, that means a\nbattle for sure...
Pardon? Whom?\nThe Lumiose Gang?
Yeah. So let’s drop it, OK?\c\nYou know, that old lady was talking\ntrash about you while you were out.\c\nShe ain’t nice. It’s not worth having a\ngreat big fight to help a person like her.
そっ　そんな！！
No, Emma.
That is not on!
If you see someone in trouble, give help.\nIf you see a Pokémon in distress, you help!\c\nThat is the policy of the Looker Bureau!\nAnd it does not change!\c\nNo matter what this person may have said\nabout me, it does not change what we do!\c\nNow, wait here, please.\nI must go to Lumiose Station.
Mr. L-L-Looker...\c\n... ... ...
[VAR TRNAME(0000)], help Mr. Looker! Please!\nHe doesn’t even have a Pokémon!\c\nH-he once said something...\nA long time ago, he had a Pokémon.\c\nA partner that was always with him...\nBut...\c\nThey were on a case...and...and...\nI don’t know what happened, but...\r\nhis partner didn’t make it...
If he tries to stand up to the Lumiose Gang\nwithout a single Pokémon on his side,\r\nhe doesn’t have a chance!\c\nOh, please! Oh, please. Go help him!
You’re his partner now, aren’t you?\nDon’t let him go alone!
Oh, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]. Thank...you...\c\nThe Lumiose Gang is always somewhere\non the platforms at Lumiose Station,\r\nup on North Boulevard...\c\nI think you’re powerful enough\nto face them, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]...\r\nBut be ready for anything! Just in case!
Don’t say that!\c\nMr. Looker has faith in you,\n[VAR TRNAME(0000)]! He truly does!\c\nHe...he said that when he looks at you,\nit almost makes him feel like he has\r\nhis lost Pokémon partner back again!\c\nHe...he said there’s something\nin your eyes, somehow the same look...\r\nSo he felt he could trust you...
どうか　おねがい　します！！\c\nあたしの　ポケモンちゃんを\nとりかえして　きて　ください！！
Mrrrawwwrrr!
LOOKER’S TOP-SECRET JOURNAL\n･ The XXth day of the XXth month...\c\nI am happy to report that Emma has learned\nto read and write and do basic arithmetic.\c\nI must be truthful and say that\nher progress is due to the diligence\r\nof her brilliant instructor. Ha ha.\c\nEmma’s intelligence and keen focus on her\nstudies have ensured her steady progress.
LOOKER’S TOP-SECRET JOURNAL\n･ The XXth day of the XXth month...\c\nRecently, I have begun to be\naccepted by the Pokémon Mimi.\c\nWhen I pat its head, it barely lashes out.\c\nWhen I leave for the evening to go home\nto my room at the hotel, it cries sadly.\c\nIt remains cautious when meeting strange adults,\nbut this is evidence to me of trauma in its past.\c\nI wonder what happened, but prying into\nanother’s secrets is not good manners,\r\nwhether person or Pokémon.\c\nI simply continue my effort to\ndeepen my bonds with Mimi.
Hey, hey, hey!\nWotcher doin’ here, old man?\c\nYou wander in here by mistake or what?\c\n’Cause you’d hafter be off yer trolley\nto come alone an’ pick a fight with us.
Indeed. Hold that thought.\c\nI am not here to pick a fight.\nInstead, I have a simple request.\c\nReturn that tourist’s stolen Pokémon!
Yer jokin’, right?\c\nIf we just give ’em back wit’\na pretty please and thank-you, sir,\r\nwhy’d we bother stealin’ sumfink?!
Lookee, old man...\nYer that Looker whatsisface, eh?\c\nWho we are is the Lumiose Gang, and\nwe can’t stand the sight of you, got it?\c\nEver since Emma went to live at yours,\nshe ain’t never come round to hang with us!
What do you mean?
Y’hear me? It’s just not on!\c\nWhy did we nab these lame Pokémon,\ndid y’ask yerself?\c\nIt were just to get yer into our manor,\nweren’t it?\c\nSo yer done, old man!\nGet yer Pokémon out for battle!\c\nIf yer win, yer take the Pokémon!\nBut... If yer lose, yer got nothin’\r\nmore to do with our Emma!
I cannot accept your challenge.
Oo-er! Yer too scared to fight?\c\nOr are yer givin’ it that yer don’t have\neven a single Pokémon to stand by yer?
You...er...“got it in one.”
Nyahahaha! Yer not havin’ us on?\c\nFine, we’ll give yer a shot to ready yerself!\nGo find some tall grass or somethin’...\r\nThen come back an’ get yer hat handed to yer!
Argh. Words are no use here.\nI’ll have to go. Later, I’ll return, and--
Oh! [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!
Ahaha...ahem. You’ve caught me\nmaking an enormous fool of myself.\c\nIt is as they say. The great Looker\nhas no Pokémon of his own...\c\nI can do nothing to restore the\nstolen Pokémon to that tourist...
Oi, mouth! Who are ya?\nYer with this old man, eh?\c\nNaw then. Yer can take his place, like.\nYer win, an’ we hand over the Pokémon.\c\nHow do ya like yer chances, eh?! Nyahaha!
[VAR TRNAME(0000)], my friend...\nI’m afraid this is all I can do for you.
If yer mates with that old geezer,\nthen yer ain’t no friend to me!\c\nAt least yer got Pokémon...\nA punch-up? Let’s be havin’ yer!
For Emma, anything!\nFor you, a knuckle sandwich!
Ah, get lost! I got nothin’ to\nsay to a pillock like you.
Wh-wh-what’s with you?\c\nGah! You’re too strong...
Guess it’s down to me to teach\nyou what’s what. Easy peasy!
Don’t mind if I do, ’cause\nI’m gonna do it for Emma!
Aw, yer a bit of a lightweight, incha?\nYer all of a tremble... Poor ickle thing.
Well now... Yer stronger than you look,\nyou cheeky thing.
Hey, hey, hey! Stop yer messin’ about!\nBeat me? Yer not serious!
Yer wut now? Yer wut?!\nLet’s do this!\c\nWe need Emma here with us, got it?!
Nyahaha! Rubbish in a bin.\nRun along home, an’ I’ll let yer go.
Whazza... What a pain...\nRight, then! I’ll just have yer...
Stop it, all of you!
Emma!
Stop it! I mean it!\nAnd return those stolen Pokémon!
Well, if that don’t take the biscuit!\nThis is down to you, Emma.\c\nYer just couldn’t be bothered with us no more.\c\nWhat’s the point of us if yer don’t show up?\c\nYer the boss of this gang!\nDid yer think how we missed yer?\c\nGoin’ off with this bad news and never a thought to\nyer old mates.\c\nThanks for nothin’!
Oh, put a sock in it!\nI said up front--don’t count me in.\c\nYou went ahead and called me boss\nwithout even asking what I wanted.\c\nI decide for myself!\c\nNow, back off before I really lose it!
N-no! N-n-not that!\c\nWe got it, boss! We got it!\nYer don’t have to be the boss!\c\nWe’ve just been missing yer since yer\nstopped comin’ round!\c\nHere, we’ll give yer back the Poké Balls,\nso forgive us--aight?!
Right. Well, enough said.\nI’ll let it go this time, but...\c\nYou need to say sorry to the lady\nyou stole from.\c\nAnd to Mr. Looker, too!
Yes, ma’am! I will!\c\nI’m awful sorry for nickin’ the Pokémon.\nYer got me bang to rights. Forgive me?
Ahem. Of course.\c\nThe Pokémon shall be safely restored,\nso let’s call it water under the bridge.
A-a-a-a-and...case closed!\c\nCheers, [VAR TRNAME(0000)], Emma!\nLet’s head back to the Looker Bureau!
OK!
Oh, I forgot something...\c\nWait. Thirty seconds!
Hey, folks!
...Eh?
It’s your wish to be friends with Emma,\nis that correct?
Yer sussed that out, eh?
When people behave with evil intentions,\nI cannot turn away and lightly forgive such.\c\nEspecially people who do cruel and\nthoughtless things. For example, stealing\r\nthe beloved Pokémon of other Trainers...
However...\nI believe...\c\nNo. Not just believe. I KNOW...\nPeople and Pokémon are both\r\ncapable of...evolving.\c\nAnd so...\c\nIf you give your word of honor not\nto ever lift a hand in cruelty again,\r\nthen you may come by the Looker Bureau\r\nanytime to visit Emma...as her friends.
Mr. L-L-Looker...
Sir...
Let us now return!\nBack once more to the Looker Bureau!
Mr. Looker... I’m really sorry about what\nhappened earlier...\c\nWhen that woman insulted you, I just saw\nred and I... I...
If you learned something from it,\nthat is all I need to hear, Emma.\c\nBut that is not what concerns me now.\c\nImagine how I felt to discover that\nyou were the boss of that gang!
Oh, it’s just silly.\nI wasn’t in the gang for real!\c\nI had a big fight with them one time, and after I\ntook them down, they figured I was their boss.\c\nIt was all their idea, not mine!
She may look like a cute kid, but Emma is\ncrazy strong!\c\nSh-she really is, Looker, sir.\nAnd M[VAR GENDBR(0000,0302)]r.iss [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!
Well, it’s the lad from the gang.\nYou’re here for a visit already? Good.\c\nAhem. You can drop that “sir” business.\nCall me Looker.
As yer say, sir. ...Looker.\nHere’s the thing, see.\c\nUs in the Lumiose Gang are gonna evolve,\njust like yer said!\c\nWe’re all done wi’ chorin’ an’ cheatin’.\nWe’re lookin’ for honest work.\c\nSo please let us come round an’ see\nour Emma, won’t yer?
... ... ...
That’s excellent.\c\nDeciding to change your course in life is more\nthan an Evolution!\r\nIt is a Mega Evolution!\c\nThere is no substitute for honest work if you want\nto make a difference in this world.
Yeah, that’s right, then.\nSee yer later, eh, Emma?
Hey, Mr. Looker?
Hm? What is it, Emma?
Mr. Looker...\c\nYou said there is no substitute for honest work if\nyou want to make a difference in this world.\c\nBut I don’t do any work at all...\c\nYou asked me to be your assistant.\nBut I’ve never done any work the whole time I’ve\r\nbeen staying here.\c\nAll I’ve done is learn things from you...\nIs that really enough?\c\nIs it really OK for me to be here?
These are good questions, Emma.\c\nYou have been learning nonstop\nsince you came here, have you not?\c\nLearning is very important work at\nany age, and especially for you now.\c\nContinue to pour your heart into your\nstudies. You have no need to worry.
But, Mr. Looker...\c\nWe’re always here in the Looker Bureau.\nAnd there’s almost never any clients!\c\nAre Mimi and I just getting in your way?\c\nI mean, you went and turned down\ntaking money from that tourist lady.\c\nBe straight with me, Mr. Looker.\c\nI’m asking, really, if it’s really OK for\nMimi and I to stay here...moneywise?
Y-you have no need to worry!\c\nOne would expect that a hard-boiled\ndetective has savings set aside, indeed!\c\nYes, indeed, Looker’s savings are as\nlofty as Sinnoh’s own Mt. Coronet!\c\nHm. Perhaps you have not met up with\nMt. Coronet in your studies yet, Emma?\c\nHa...hahaha!\nI ask you to leave such worries to me.\c\nYour part is to study hard, so you can\nbecome my trusted assistant. Deal? Good.
Hey, Mimi...
Mrawr?
Mr. Looker said we didn’t need\nto worry about anything, y’know?\c\nBut I just don’t feel like we can keep\ndepending on him like this forever.\c\nHe lets us stay here for free and\npays for all the food we eat...
Mrrrawr mrawr...
So I think I need to do something.
Mrrr-mrrrawr!
Thanks to Mr. Looker, I can read now, right?\c\nAnd I’ve seen signs around town for part-time work.
Murrr?
The signs say it’s easy work and anyone\ncan learn it.\r\nMaybe even I can do it, then!\c\nI’m going over there right now to ask them\nfor a job!\c\nWhat do you think, Mimi?
Murrr-murrrawr! 
Hee hee hee, really?
Oh, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\nHave you seen Emma?\c\nShe always seems to be out and about\nthese days.\c\nWhen I ask for details, she has nothing to say...\c\nI’m a bit worried. If you see her, would you let\nher know that?
Mrrrawwwr...
LOOKER’S TOP-SECRET JOURNAL\n･ The XXth day of the XXth month...\c\nEmma has been going out more and more often.\nI find it worrying, not knowing where she goes.\r\nIs this perhaps how a father feels?\c\n･ The XXth day of the XXth month...\c\nThe young people from the gang came by to tell\nus that they had secured part-time work.\c\nI’ve never worked within the Community Safety\nDepartment, but even I do feel quite moved to\r\nsee young people turning their lives around.

[VAR TRNAME(0000)], you’re here! You got\nmy message on the Holo Caster, in fact?\c\nThen I need three minutes only.\nIt is this. We have a case to solve!\c\nI count on your help, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\nLet us put our partnership to the test!
My notes are on the desk.\nTake 30 seconds to read up on the case.
LOOKER’S NOTEBOOK\nCase open:\c\n★ Client: A rep from a Lumiose City mothers’ group\c\n★ Details: “Kids in Lumiose City seem to be\nspending a lot of time in back alleys recently.”\c\n“What are they up to in these shadowy, suspicious\nplaces? Inquiring mothers want to know!”
“My son is about to take the entrance exam\nfor an elite school for future Ace Trainers!”\c\n“I can’t have him do anything stupid and\nget a black mark on his academic record!”\c\n“You must do something to make kids stop\nhanging out in those suspicious alleys!”\c\n★ Reward: Enough dough to last for a week
All read up and all ready to go? Good!\c\nThe first thing I want you to do is to\nvisit those dark alleys in Lumiose City.\c\nFind where kids are hanging out, and\nget the lowdown on the situation.\c\nGot it? Think you can handle it, partner?
I am counting on you, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].\c\nThere are a number of alleys here in\nLumiose City. Somewhere, in one\r\nof them, you should find those kids!\c\nYes. Yes, indeed. Hmm...\nMy gut tells me there’s something fishy\r\nabout the alley leading off South Boulevard.\c\nWhen you’ve got a gut boiled as hard\nas mine, it’s worth paying attention to!\c\nStart your investigations on South Boulevard.\nI’ll join you when I can.
Oh, wait! Here’s an idea! I need three seconds...\c\nTo help you on your way, I’ll jot down the\nlocations of all the alleys in my notebook!
You’ve got this, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]. Fear not.\nOff to the dark alleyways of Lumiose City!
What? [VAR TRNAME(0000)], no, no, no!\nThat is not the answer I want to hear!\c\nI want you to investigate the dark alleys\nof Lumiose City and scope out what’s\r\nhappening with these kids!\c\nYou’ve got this, right?
LOOKER’S NOTEBOOK\nAlleys in Lumiose City\c\n★ South Boulevard\n    Beside Restaurant Le Nah\c\n★ North Boulevard\n    Across from the Galette Stand\c\n★ North Boulevard\n    Across from Lumiose Station\c\n★ North Boulevard\n    Beside Café Triste
Huh? Who are you?\nThis is our secret base!\c\nYou’re a grown-up!\nYou’re not allowed in.\c\nWell, if you think\nyou’re comin’ in,\r\nyou’re gonna hafta\r\nbeat me in battle!
Ah ha! Look out!\nI’m weally, weally stwong!
Shoo! Shoo!\nGo on! Get lost!
Huh, you’re pretty strong.\nNot bad... I guess I’ll let you in.
Uh-uh, you!\nWhat a worffless little sister I have!\c\nYou’re gonna hafta fight me now!\nLast chance if you wanna run away!\c\nDo you think you can beat me and\nmy Pokémon in battle? Pffft!
Huh-uh, the bigger they are,\nthe harder they fall!\c\nYou’re gonna be sorry you\never saw me. Come on!
Bye-bye, worffless grown-up!\nHurry home to your mama!
Uh-huh! This Trainer’s\ngot some muscle in h[VAR GENDBR(00FF,0202)]iser hustle!
Hahaha! You there!\nYou’re not too shabby!\c\nBut can ya beat me?\nBring it, if ya got the guts!
This is our own private paradise!\nTake off and leave us in peace!
Just leave us alone!\nGo home already!
Harrumph. I guess you’re sorta strong...\c\nFine, then. I guess I’ll let you continue.
Wha-wha-wha-wha...\nWhat do I do now?!\c\nY-you, um, you really\nwant to get in here, huh?
Of course ya do... So...\nI figure I’m gonna hafta fight ya.
Th-that’s right! Good!\nN-now go away already!
Erk... I figured I’d lose anyway...\c\nNow it’s up to Mimi to save us.
Pardon, pardon. It took a while to find you!\c\nHow’s the investigation going, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]?\nDo you have news to report?
Mrrawwwr!
Oho!\nDid you hear that cry?\c\nI feel like it came from\ndeeper inside the alley...
Mrrawwwr!
Why, it’s a Pokémon!\c\nBut to threaten humans like that,\nit is apparently none too gentle...\r\nIt may consider this area its territory.
Yup, old man, you got that right.
Eh? Who’s there?\nShow yourself!
Oh, nobody special.\c\nBut this little sweetie right here is Mimi.\c\nThat’s what I named it, anyway.
Mrrawr! Mrrrawwwrrr!
Ahem. Then this is your Pokémon?\c\nIn which case, would you mind\nreturning it to its Poké Ball for a bit?
Huh?\nWhat Poké Ball?
Pardon?
I’m not a Trainer!\nMimi is my friend.\c\nI have no money to buy Poké Balls,\nso I can’t be a Trainer, you get it?\c\nAnyway, Mimi and I don’t need\na Poké Ball to be friends!
Of course. I...get it.\nPlease forgive my error.\c\nMy name is Looker.\nI work as a detective.\c\nMay I introduce my\npartner, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].
If you will permit me to ask, Mimi’s friend...\nI am interested in what you’re all doing here.
Well, we’re all playing, that’s all.\nEverybody here is a friend of mine.\c\nWhat are you asking for?\nDo you want to join or something?
What! No, no, no-o-o-o-o!\nDon’t do it!\c\nThis is our secret base.\nKids only!\c\nNo grown-ups allowed!
Mrrawwwr!
Oh, put a sock in it!\nPlay nice, both of you!\c\nHow would you like to get left out\njust ’cause you’re old and stuff?
... ... ...\c\nYou seem to have a good group\nof friends playing together here.\c\nBut why did you pick a dark alley\nlike this one to play in?\c\nLumiose City is filled with plazas\nand open spaces and sunny corners.\c\nFlowers can’t bloom without sunshine,\nand neither can young folks, you know.
Oh, really? Well...\c\nMimi and I have always lived in alleys,\nso I don’t know much about sunshine.
...Mrawp.
You live in an alley? You and Mimi?\nAnd...your family? They--
They’re gone. I’m alone.
I see.
Well, but... But Mimi is sort of my family.\nWe stick together.
Indeed...
Indeed!\c\nI, Looker, have struck upon an idea!\nA genius idea. And here it is!\c\nFriend of Mimi! I invite you to stay\nat my office, the Looker Bureau.\c\nYou may work as my assistant and,\nin exchange, you may live in the office.\c\nI myself live elsewhere in a hotel, so\nyou’ll have it all to yourself after hours!
Wha...
It is not to imply that anything’s wrong\nwith a free life in the alleys, but...\c\nTo have a home to shelter you\nfrom the cold and the rain...\c\nThere is joy in having work to do each day\nand your efforts seen and appreciated.\c\nThis idea is genius, even for me!
And, Mimi, are you on board, too?\nIt wouldn’t be the same without you!
Mrrrawr...\c\nMrrawwwr!
Wh-what? Why did Mimi run off?
Mimi gets scared pretty easy.\nAfraid of humans, I guess.\r\nEspecially grown-ups.\c\nHey... Mr. Looker-guy...\c\nFor a minute there, I was kinda happy\nthat you invited me to stay with you...\r\nYou’re pretty cool. But I can’t.\c\nMimi likes it better here.\nI can’t leave Mimi behind.\r\nWe stick together.
Hold on!\nMimi may grow to like me in time.\r\nBut even if not, we can try a new angle.\c\nAt a time like this, it helps to have\na partner you can count on.
P-partner?
Indeed!\n[VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\c\nYour assignment is to befriend Mimi.\nYou can do it!
Umm... [VAR TRNAME(0000)]?\c\nIf you wanna make friends with Mimi,\nyou’re gonna have to track it down first.\c\nThere’s, like, tons of alleys in Lumiose City.\c\nMimi wanders all over them on its strolls.\c\nIf you find it, try talking to it...\nOr do something to make Mimi like you.
Can you handle it, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]?\nIf you succeed in making friends\r\nwith Mimi, it may accept me as well.\r\nI’m your partner, after all!\c\nYes! [VAR TRNAME(0000)], I’m counting on you!
Her an’ Mimi play with us whenever\nwe want. They’re weally, weally nice.
Mimi gets mad when strangers\ntry to touch it, y’know?\c\nIf you want Mimi to like you,\nbetter not try to grab it or anything.
You’re gonna look for Mimi?\c\nWell, this here is the only\nalley on South Boulevard.\c\nThere are three other alleys you\ncan get to from North Boulevard.\c\nAs long as that old guy hangs around,\nno way is Mimi coming back here.\c\nBetcha it’s wandering around those\nalleys up on North Boulevard.
Mother wants me to be an Ace Trainer.\nI was a Rising Star, trying to please her.\c\nBut I couldn’t really shine, because my\ntrue dream is to become a Swimmer ♂!\c\nI just ended up avoiding the pressure\nby hanging out with my friends here.
Murrr... Mrrrawwwr...
Mimi is looking at you.\nWhat are you going to do?
...Mrrrawwwrar.
Hiss! Hissssss!
Mrawr! ♪ Murr-murr-murrr! ♪
Mimi ran off somewhere...\c\nIt seems you didn’t succeed\nin catching Mimi’s attention at all.
With an angry scowl,\nMimi ran off somewhere.
Mimi ran off somewhere--\nwith a hint of a smile...
Murrrmurrr-mrrrawwwr!
Oh! [VAR TRNAME(0000)]! Well done!\nMimi seems to have taken a shine to you!
Awesome!\n[VAR TRNAME(0000)], are you wicked or what?\r\nHow’d you get Mimi to like you so fast?
Thank you, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].\nYou have proven your worth as my partner.
Well, friend of Mimi?\nProblem solved? All set?\c\nIs it time for you to graduate\nfrom life on the streets and join\r\nthe Looker Bureau as my assistant?
OK! I’m ready!\nAs long as Mimi’s with me! \c\nI’m pretty curious to find\nout what a detective does!
Ha ha!\nA detective is a hard-boiled kind of person!\c\n[VAR TRNAME(0000)], let us make our way to\nthe Looker Bureau with our new assistant!
Wow...\nSo this is the Looker Bureau?\c\nIt’s sure warmer than the alley.\nThis is gonna be great, huh, Mimi?
Murrr-mrrrawwr?
Please, make yourself comfortable!\c\nFrom today on, you will\nwork here as my assistant!\c\nAnd you may live here as\nlong as you choose!
I seem to have forgotten my manners.\nPardon me for not asking your name.\c\nWhat do you prefer to go by, or\nshall we stick with “Friend-of-Mimi”?
Who, me? I’m just Emma.
Nice to meet you! ♪
Emma, is it?\nIndeed, a pretty name!
Ahem. The case of the kids\nin the alleys is now closed.\c\nWith Emma staying here instead,\nkids will stop making the alleys\r\ntheir second home!\c\n[VAR TRNAME(0000)], I will send a\nmessage on your Holo Caster\r\nthe next time we get a case!\r\nI look forward to it indeed.
Emma and Mimi...\c\nI was absolutely right to invite them\nto stay here. Truly genius, no doubt.\c\nWhat I don’t know is if enough work\nwill appear to keep food on our table.\c\n... ... ...\c\nI-I guess I’ll roll up my sleeves and\nconcentrate on my mission!\c\nTh-this is what it means to be\na hard-boiled detective.
Hello, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].\nI don’t have any cases at the moment.\c\nI’m teaching Emma to read and write\nand do basic arithmetic.\c\nWhen a new case appears,\nI’ll contact you via Holo Caster!\c\nI look forward to it indeed.
Oh, hi, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\nDid you ever go to school?\c\nSchool is a place where they teach\nyou all kinds of things, so I heard.\c\nGuess what?\c\nI told Mr. Looker I’d never gone to school,\nand he said he’d teach me himself!

It was good of you to come.
Yes... I need 30 seconds of your time.\nOr--three minutes only. Thirty minutes, maybe.\c\nFirst, you must know that I have taken the\nliberty of investigating you, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].\c\nFor example, I can say that you’re the\nnewest Champion of the Kalos region.\c\nAlso, I can say that you were the one to save\nour world from the group known as Team Flare.\c\nGood. Very good.
I have delayed in giving my introduction.\c\nMy code name is--no! Hah!\nI mean to say, my name is Looker.\c\nI’m no more than a grim, middle-aged man\nwho works in this town as a detective.\c\nAnd now, let us approach the real subject,\n[VAR TRNAME(0000)], my friend.\c\nI investigated you, yes. I called you here today,\nyes. The reasons for these actions? Listen well...
Lumiose City... It is a tourist destination\nwhose name is known all over the world.\c\nMany kinds of people live here, and even\nmore come to visit and enjoy the atmosphere.\c\nThe fact is, wherever there are so many\npeople in one place, trouble is never far behind.\c\nTrouble beckons me. Yes.\nTrouble troubles me.\c\nAnd so I arrive, and so I open this agency.
Being a detective and doing such work\nrequires a person with a hard-boiled heart.\c\nBut even a heart that embraces the loneliness\ncan sometimes stumble, falter, doubt.\c\nAnd that’s where you come in, kid.\nI want you to be my assistant.\c\nNo, more than that!\nI want you to be my partner.\c\nIf a Champion like you and an\niron-jawed detective like me join forces,\r\nI promise we can bring peace to Lumiose City!
What does your heart say, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]?\nWill you partner with me and fight crime?
No? [VAR TRNAME(0000)], my friend!\nThis answer surprises me. It is not what I expected.\c\nI need a partner like you in order\nto protect the peace of this city.\c\nReconsider, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]. The city needs you.\nI need you. Will you not be my partner?
For your brave answer, I thank you.\nLumiose City will regain its tranquillity!\c\nWell, I wish it could be that easy.\c\nBecause even though you are Champion, you’re\nstill a rookie when it comes to detective work.\c\nAnd that’s why I must ask you to enroll in\nmy class in detective and espionage skills:\c\n“The Looker Method: Yes, even YOU can\nbecome a detective in five easy steps!”\c\nWhen you’re ready to learn the meaning of\n“hard-boiled,” just come and talk to me again.
Oh, you’re ready for adventure now?\nAllow me to explain what you will be doing.\c\nYou will need to find five Looker Tickets that\nhave been sprinkled about Lumiose City,\r\nand then bring them back to me!\c\nThere’s nothing more to it! Simple as can be!\c\nThe Looker Tickets will be sure to catch\nyour eye with their glitter and sparkles.\c\nI want you to succeed, so I have left some hints\nin my notebook about where to find the tickets!
Ah ha, so then, it is time.\nAway with you to begin your training!\r\nI trust you’ll live up to my hopes!
What is it, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]? Are you feeling\na bit stuck with your training?\c\nWell, you’ve found [VAR NUM2(0001)] ticket[VAR NUMBRNCH(0001,0100)]s so far.\c\nDon’t give up, my friend! Dive back into\nLumiose City, and find those tickets!

...Ahem! With that accomplished,\nlet me issue my request once more.\c\n[VAR TRNAME(0000)], be my crime-fighting partner?
Excellent. It will be an honor for you to serve as\nan official member of the Looker Bureau! And...\r\nas partner to the one and only Looker!\c\nI’ll send you a message on your Holo Caster\nwhenever we have a job to do!
Pardon? No?\n...\c\nListen, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].\nThis answer is not acceptable.\c\nI need a partner like you in order to fight\ncrime and protect the peace of this city!
... ... ...\c\nTo complete my patented training course,\n“The Looker Method: Yes, even YOU can\r\nbecome a detective in five easy steps!”\r\nin so little time and with such ease...\c\n[VAR TRNAME(0000)], you truly are a masterful Trainer.\c\nThe big case on which I have been at work...\nIt is a certainty. We will crack this case together.\c\nAnd, as for what is past, old friend, be patient.\nJustice will be served--enough for all!
Ah! It is my partner, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\c\nWe have not had a single case come to\nus here at the Looker Bureau!\c\nIn other words, Lumiose City is at peace...\nAnd I’m out of a job and a paycheck!\c\nI’ll send you a message just as soon as\nwe get a case. Watch your Holo Caster!\c\nI’m looking forward to your help once\nwe get a big case to crack!

Congratulations! You’ve found a ticket!\nShall I share my diagnostics with you again?\r\nThis ticket must be...\r\nyour fourth ticket.

What an amazing turnout! All of these people\nare here to celebrate your achievements.
I’d like to present you with the Honor of Kalos\nfor the bravery you showed battling Team Flare!
I’m so proud of you all!
On behalf of the entire\nKalos region, I’d like to say...
Thank you!
Battle with me.
I want to know what a “Trainer” is.
Thank you very much for battling with me.\nNow I finally feel free...
Free from the part of me mired in sorrow--the\npart of me that built the ultimate weapon...
Floette...
It’s been 3,000 years...
His Pokémon was waiting all this time...
Waiting for him to return to the man he was.\nThe man who loved Pokémon with all his heart.

A terribly long time ago...
There was a man and a Pokémon.\nHe loved that Pokémon very much.
A war began.
The man’s beloved Pokémon took part\nin the war.
Several years passed.
He was given a tiny box.
The man wanted to bring the Pokémon back.\nNo matter what it took.
The man built a machine to give\nit life.
He brought his beloved Pokémon back.
The man had suffered too much.\nHis rage still had not subsided.
He could not forgive the world\nthat had hurt the Pokémon he loved.
He turned the machine into\nthe ultimate weapon.
The man became a bringer of destruction\nthat ended the war.
The Pokémon that was given life\nmust have known...
That the lives of many Pokémon\nwere taken to restore its life.
The resurrected Pokémon left the man.

Dude, kid...\c\nWhat d’you think you’re wearing?\nYou ain’t got no sense of style.\c\nYou’re getting about a million years ahead of\nyourself if you think you can meet the boss.
Dude, kid...\c\nWhat’s up with your crazy style?\nIt’s, like, out-of-this-world awesome!\c\nI’m begging you, kid! Please!\nWon’t you meet with the boss?
Yo, boss!
Go on with you.\c\nBut don’t say nothin’ rude.\nHe is the boss, y’know.
The boss is totally awesome, right?\c\nAnd d’you know why he’s so awesome?\c\nBecause he’s the baddest skater in the region.\nEveryone calls him the Twirling Whirlwind!
You’ve done well to come to me.\nI am the boss here. Call me Boss.\c\nForget names. That’s the only word that\ncould be properly used to describe me.\c\nAnd who are you, young one?\c\n... ... ...\c\n[VAR TRNAME(0000)]? It is a good name.
I have been waiting many years...\c\nI’ve sought an individual who was born into this\nworld for the great purpose of beautiful skating.\c\nIt seems the moment I have been waiting for\nhas finally come.\c\nYou are the one! You will be able to use this\nmove far better than I have ever been able to!
[VAR TRNAME(0000)] was taught the cosmic flip trick!
What I just taught you can only be done by\ngoing off a ledge while doing a drift-and-dash.\r\nIt is an extremely difficult technique to master.\r\nThis technique is known as the cosmic flip.
If you can use that move successfully,\nthen I’ll have no regrets left in life!
Whenever you use this technique,\nI am right there with you in spirit.\c\nThank you, [VAR TRNAME(0000)], my friend...
Think what you may of my looks, but at least\nI’m honest. And I’m telling you...\c\nYou’re not cool at all. Just look at you!\nYou’ve got to take care of yourself!
Think what you may of my looks, but at least\nI’m honest. And I’m telling you...\c\nYou’re definitely cool. Just look at you!\nI think I might be falling in love!
Think what you may of my looks, but at least\nI’m honest. And I’m telling you...\c\nYou’re definitely cool. Just look at you!\nI think you’ll be my next idol!
I came here because I heard there\nwas some great Roller Skater, but...\c\nIt seems like my skills as a Roller Skater\nstill aren’t quite up to snuff...
You met the Twirling Whirlwind?!\nYou lucky little... I’m so jealous...
They say he could once captivate the hearts\nof all Lumiose City, dashing through her streets.\c\nThe legendary Roller Skater and his legendary\nmove... I really wanna learn it...
Your technique is fantastic.\c\nThanks to you, the legend of the cosmic flip\nwill continue on into the future.\r\nWhen I think that, I feel a bit cheerier.
It’s not for skating, but I’ve\ngot a trick to teach ya.\r\nTry using this move, would ya?
Throw your item at another Pokémon,\nand it will catch it and hold on to it.\c\nYou can throw something nasty at an\nopponent, or you can throw a Berry or\r\nsomething to an ally in a Double Battle.

So this is the place...\c\nIt’s really hard to breathe in here.\nFeels like there’s a weight on my chest...
Hey...\c\nIs that thing that looks like a tree\nthe Legendary Pokémon?\r\nIt doesn’t look like it’s alive, but...
Hey...\c\nIs that thing that looks like a cocoon\nthe Legendary Pokémon?\r\nIt doesn’t look like it’s alive, but...
That’s none of your business, kids.
The ultimate weapon has taken 99 percent\nof the Legendary Pokémon’s energy.\c\nBut just to make double sure nothing\ngoes wrong, let’s take these runts out!
Nooo!\nI hate being chased!
Oh, Shauna... This again?\c\n[VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\nYou take care of things here!\c\nI’ll protect Shauna!
It’s the Poké Ball Factory all over again...\c\n[VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\nYou take care of things here!\c\nI’ll protect Shauna!
Make sure to take care of those\nrunts that ran away!\c\nI should’ve expected as much from\nkids who made it clear down here.\c\nIt was a pretty simple tactic, but\nit managed to split us up.\c\nThat girl’s pretty good!
So, you really think you can beat us?
No way!\c\nThis puts the “no” in no way!
Contact Lysandre!\c\nCall for reinforcements!

What a relief... Now they\ncan’t use the ultimate weapon.
Great! Now they can’t\nuse the ultimate weapon.
You’re amazing, [VAR TRNICK(0001)]!\c\nA Legendary Pokémon wanting to be\nyour friend like that! It’s unbelievable!
What a startling development!\c\nI never would’ve thought you\nwere really a chosen one!
So THIS is the mighty Xerneas?!\nI expected more from a Pokémon\r\ncalled a legend!\c\nYou desire help from people?\nYOU need help from a human?
So THIS is the mighty Yveltal?!\nI expected more from a Pokémon\r\ncalled a legend!\c\nYou desire help from people?\nYOU need help from a human?
Wh-what’s going on with that outfit!\nIs that really you, Lysandre?\r\nOh, whatever!\c\n[VAR TRNICK(0001)] already beat you!\nWhat are you doing here?
For me, victory is using the ultimate weapon.\c\nIn order to do that, I need to reclaim\nthe Legendary Pokémon’s power and\r\nsend it to that weapon once again.
I’ll be taking the Legendary Pokémon\nback now!
This time, I won’t lose.\c\nI, too, shall use the Mega Ring and\nMega Stone that you researched\r\nduring your travels.
Whaugh!
Um... Know what I think?\nEven if there’s only a little\r\nbit of something, it’s still\r\nbest to share it.
Even you managed to use\nMega Evolution...\c\nThat’s because Gyarados shared\nits power with you, didn’t it?\c\nAnd not just Gyarados, but\nyour other Pokémon, too...
...
The Legendary Pokémon is gone,\nso you can’t use the ultimate\r\nweapon anymore, right?\c\nYou don’t have to worry about\nthe future all by yourself...\c\nI think everyone should work together\nto make a better, beautiful world...
The Legendary Pokémon is gone,\nso you can’t use the ultimate\r\nweapon anymore, right?\c\nYou don’t have to worry about\nthe future all alone...\c\nShouldn’t everybody work together\nto make a beautiful world?
If that were possible, all wars would have\nended long ago!\c\nI can only see one future!\c\nOne where selfish, foolish humans think\nabout nothing other than themselves and\r\nsteal more and more from one another...\r\nIt’s a tragic future!
The original purpose of this device was to bring\na Pokémon back to life.\c\nBut the ancient king transformed it into\nthis ultimate weapon...\c\nHmm. When the Legendary Pokémon awakened,\nit took back much of its energy--its power--\r\nthat had been sent to the ultimate weapon.\c\nThere’s not much power left...\nBut there IS enough to use it once...
[VAR TRNAME(0001)], Sycamore’s pupils...\c\nLet us live forever...\nThat’s right! I shall grant you eternal life!\c\nI’ll give you the pain of endlessly waiting\nfor a beautiful world to finally be built!
[VAR TRNAME(0001)], Sycamore’s pupils...\c\nThe ultimate weapon is a flower that\nbloomed to no avail... Just like me...\c\nBut this ends here! I will show you\nwhat its remaining power can do!
[VAR TRNAME(0000)]! Shauna!\nLet’s get out of here!
[VAR TRNAME(0000)]! Shauna!\nLet’s get out of here!
If you guys think we’ll let you\njoin Team Flare after all this,\r\nyou’ve got another think coming!
Lysandre is only going to save Team Flare,\nbecause we’re the only ones who are\r\ntruly worried about the future.
Taking all of the money and stuff for ourselves\nwill make a world where Team Flare is happy!
Not having a ton of money\nis really stressful, you know...
The ultimate weapon is stealing\nthe Legendary Pokémon’s power.
There’s no way everybody can be happy!\nEach of us has different dreams.
Do you actually think all living\nthings can be truly happy?
One person’s pleasure is\nanother person’s pain, right?
Add [VAR PKNAME(0001)] to your party\nfrom the Box?
[VAR PKNAME(0001)] will not be added to your party...\nIs that OK?
Send which Pokémon back to the Box?
Sending [VAR PKNICK(0002)] back to the Box...\nIs that OK?

I’m sorry...\c\nI know...\nI’m just going to slow you down.
...
...
But...
But friends should stick together!
I’m the one who should be apologizing.\c\nYou came all the way out here, and I wasn’t\nvery considerate of your feelings...\c\nYou are right.\nFriends should stick together.
[VAR TRNICK(0000)], we should all go together, right?
Of course!
But...
I knew you’d agree!\c\nOK! Shauna, [VAR TRNICK(0000)] and I will\ngo ahead. Stay close to us, OK?
I know you’re concerned because\nit’s dangerous.\c\nBut it would be more dangerous\nfor her to go back alone...\c\nShauna, let’s go together!
I’m sorry...\c\nI wasn’t thinking clearly, and\nI didn’t consider your feelings.\c\nThank you for coming.\nFriends should stick together.
[VAR TRNICK(0000)], we’ll all\nstick together, right?
Naturally!
But...
It’s settled then!\c\nShauna, [VAR TRNICK(0000)] and I\nwill go ahead. Stay close, OK?
I know how you feel.\nDanger does wait up ahead.\c\nBut she’ll be much safer if\nshe stays with us, right?\c\nShauna, [VAR TRNICK(0000)] and I\nwill go ahead. Stay close, OK?
OK!\nThank you! ♪
It’s an electronic lock.\c\nWhat should we do?
An electronic lock...\c\nNow what?
This might help!\c\nIt’s a device that helps you\nwhen you’re stuck on a puzzle.\c\nClemont gave it to me!
An electronic lock and a puzzle\nare the same sort of thing, right? ♪
Ta daa! The lock opened! ♪\c\nOh! And the device actually broke...
Amazing, Shauna!\c\nYou and Clemont’s device\nare both full of surprises...
So... We’re finally here.\c\nThe Legendary Pokémon is inside.\nLet’s go help it!
Not bad, Shauna!\c\nWell, Clemont was the one who made it.\nBut you brought it here!\c\nSo, I guess both of you are pretty great!
We’re finally here.\c\nThe Legendary Pokémon is inside.\nLet’s save it together!
Are you going back?
Don’t...keep us waiting long, OK?
Let’s hurry.
Let’s go.\nShauna, you come, too.
I get what Lysandre is trying to say,\nbut his methods are insane!
The ultimate weapon...\nWhat will happen if it’s used?
Anyway, we have to hurry and stop it!
Are you going back?
Got it.
Let’s hurry!
Let’s go.\nShauna, come along.
I get what Lysandre is trying to say,\nbut what he wants to do is so wrong!
The ultimate weapon... It’s crazy!\nPeople shouldn’t make things like that!
We have to stop the ultimate weapon.
I’m afraid we’re going to have to ask you\nto turn back.\c\nThe Legendary Pokémon IS at the end of\nthis chamber, after all.
Searching deep in Kalos’s mountains\nfor the Legendary Pokémon was\r\nbackbreaking work.\c\nAll of that dirt completely wrecked\nmy nice white suit.
Why did you tell them that?!\nWho would even do something like that?!
That’s right. The Legendary Pokémon\nis deep within our secret headquarters.\c\nBut its energy is being absorbed\ninto the ultimate weapon.
Even if things are just as we heard,\nI can’t believe they’re sending smart guys like\r\nus to run off some little “Rattata” that wandered in.
The five million I paid to join\nTeam Flare won’t go to waste, right?
We won’t lose!\nYou won’t get one step farther!\c\nThe Trainers moving on to the next\nlevel will be Team Flare!
I just can’t keep listening to\nselfish fools anymore!\c\nThe only thing that matters is that the\nmembers of Team Flare are happy!
Our plans haven’t succeeded just yet!\nWe cannot afford any careless mistakes!
We worried about an uncertain future,\nbut Lysandre showed us how\r\nto get to his certain future.
Who’s got that flair? Team Flare!\nYeah, we’ve got that flair! Team Flare!
Who’s got that flair? Team Flare!\nYeah, we’ve got that flair! Team Flare!
The Kalos region...\nI’m sure it’s gonna be OK!\c\nYou two are amazing, after all!\nI know you can stop them!

The ultimate weapon’s flower has\nfinally bloomed above the soil.\r\nDon’t you find its beauty captivating?\c\nAs we speak, it draws its energy\nfrom the Legendary Pokémon.
[VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\c\nI apologize that the weapon was unearthed\neven after you chose correctly in the lab.\c\nBut conflicting egos drive this world--things\ndon’t always go the way you want!
We’re not going to let you\nuse the ultimate weapon!
Ultimate weapon?\nWe won’t let you use it!
Even though resources, space, and energy on this\nplanet are limited, the number of people and\r\nPokémon has increased to an unsustainable level.\c\nWhether it’s money or energy, the ones who steal\nare the ones who win in this world.
But that doesn’t give you the right to destroy\neveryone but the ones Team Flare chooses!
So what? That doesn’t give you the right to destroy\neveryone except the few that Team Flare chooses!
So, tell me. The Mega Ring,\ndid you share it?
That’s different!\nWe competed for it, but...
That’s different!\nWe did compete to see who got it, but...
When there is only one of something,\nit can’t be shared.\c\nWhen something can’t be shared,\nit will be fought over.\c\nAnd when something is fought over,\nsome must survive without it.\c\nThe only way to create a world where\npeople live in beauty, a world without\r\nconflict or theft, is to reduce the number\r\nof living things.
What about Pokémon?
What about Pokémon?
...
Tears... Why?!
Why...are you crying?
Pokémon...\c\nShall no longer exist.\c\nPokémon are wonderful beings.\c\nHumans have worked with Pokémon, and\nwe have helped each other flourish.\c\nBut precisely because of that,\nthey will inevitably become tools\r\nfor war and theft!
Enough of this.\c\nYou want to stop the ultimate weapon,\nand I refuse to do so.\c\nSo, I will keep you busy for just a moment...
You’re as strong as ever.\c\nBut...\c\nIt’s too late!\c\nThere’s no hope for you now!\c\nGo down to the lowest floor,\nand see for yourself!
It’s not over yet!
[VAR TRNICK(0001)]!\nLet’s look for the Legendary Pokémon!\c\nTrainers are protected by Pokémon,\nbut they protect Pokémon, too, right?\c\nLook! You can see the entrance to the\nlower floors over there!
It’s not over until it’s over!
[VAR TRNICK(0001)]!\nLet’s look for the Legendary Pokémon!\c\nTrainers are protected by Pokémon,\nbut they protect Pokémon, too, right?\c\nLook! That’s the entrance to\nthe lower floors over there!
It was 3,000 years ago...\nThe ultimate weapon was used,\r\nand many Pokémon lost their lives...
I’ve been saved by Lysandre’s support...
I’ll leave my fate to Lysandre, but\nI’m worried about tomorrow!
The Pokémon attached to the stones\non Route 10 are an energy source\r\nfor using the ultimate weapon.
We’re absorbing the energy from\nthe mysterious tree.\c\nBut that’s it. There isn’t a Pokémon\nanywhere near here.
We’re absorbing the energy from\nthe mysterious cocoon.\c\nBut that’s it. There isn’t a Pokémon\nanywhere near here.
All systems are go for the ultimate weapon.\c\nAll we have to do is charge it using every\nbit of that thing’s power.
Everyone in the whole world must be happy\nbefore any one person can be happy.\c\nBut the world is too big, and there are too\nmany people and Pokémon, so there isn’t\r\nenough happiness to go around...

I’m not stuck! It’s just that a pleasantly\ncool breeze drifts through here.

How much longer?
If you’re just interested in the facts,\nI’d say we already have enough energy\r\nto power the device.
Good. Let’s finish up here and move out.\nThere’s still more work to be done.
What other work do you mean?
Perhaps you mean taking out that annoying\nlittle Pokémon Trainer over there?
What’s this?
I didn’t think anyone remained here\nafter we dealt with the workers.
Scientist, take care of this pesky intruder!
Ah ha ha!\nIt would be my pleasure!
Come on, little Trainer!\nLet’s see what you’ve got!
Allow me to introduce myself, intruder.\nMy name is Aliana.\c\nAs you can see, I’m one of Team Flare’s Scientists.\nI’m researching a certain something that you\r\nwouldn’t understand, anyway.\c\nUnfortunately for you, I’ve been charged\nwith the simple task of your elimination.
Ah ha ha!\c\nWell, I certainly didn’t expect you to be so\ninteresting! I do hope we can meet again!
All clear. No problems in sight!\nUnless you count how boring this is!
I think I understand now...\nPeaceful but boring may not be so bad...
Oh, I sure do love me a good happening!\c\nI always feel like I’ve gotten something done\nafter overcoming a challenge!
My life is full of happenings...\nMaybe that’s not so bad, though!
Hey! Stop right there, intruder!\nI’ll warn you now--I can be persistent!
Now I’m mad! I told you I was persistent!\nI refuse to budge from this spot! Not an inch!
Go, Team Flare! Go, go, Team Flare!\nF to the L to the A to the R to the E!\r\nF-L-A-R-E! We bring it! You know it!
Simple defeat won’t stop me from cheering!\c\nGo, Team Flare! Go, go, Team Flare!\nF to the L to the A to the R to the E!
What do I want to do?\c\nHmmm... How about inflicting some\nserious pain on your Pokémon?
You should do what you wanna do, too!
You’ll not get past me! My pride\nis enough to keep you at bay!
I may not have been able to stop you,\nbut I ain’t apologizing to nobody!\c\nThe person up top who assigned me\nto this post is at fault--not me!
Oh my!
You chased off that mysterious bunch\nbefore we could even get here?
Well, I guess there’s always room for\nmore defenders of Kalos!\c\nLet me heal your Pokémon as thanks!
You and your Pokémon are the ultimate team!\nNo doubt about it!\c\nBut don’t push yourself too hard.\nHere. Take these.
Thanks to you, the power\nis back on in Lumiose City.\c\nNow people can pass through\nthe gate connecting Route 13\r\nto Lumiose City again.
Well, I think us mysterious people\nwill be off now!\c\nI leave before being left. I decide.\c\nAu revoir!

Your dear Pokémon are so full of energy!
How about if I help your dear\nPokémon rest up a bit?
You can go up ahead here if you use\nthe move Strength.
Hm? If you want to get to Ambrette Town,\nyou’ll be best off heading back to Route 7.\r\nThen take the other entrance to the cave.
Ah yes, the HM Strength is the perfect\nharmony between Pokémon and Trainer!
I can’t get out of here!\nAnd it’s all your fault!\c\nSorry. I had some frustration to vent.\nHere--have this as my apology.
Frustration is a move that gets stronger\nthe less your Pokémon like you.\c\nFrustrating, huh?

Oh, if it isn’t [VAR TRNAME(0000)].\nWhat is your title in the nobility?\c\nWhat?\nYou don’t have a title?!\c\nThat’s a surprise. No one could doubt that\na kid as strong as you should have one.
See, your title here at the Battle Chateau\nshows everyone just how strong you are.\c\nOnly a handful of Trainers can join the\nranks of the nobility and earn these titles!
Lady Viola, are you acquainted with the\nyoung [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0409)]gentlemanlady?\c\nAhh, I see you carry the Bug Badge, young [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0403)]sirmiss.\c\nIt appears that Lady Viola has recognized\nyour ability as a Trainer, then.
It is a pleasure to meet you, my l[VAR GENDBR(00FF,0303)]ordady.\nMy name is Hennessy.\c\nMight I ask your name?\c\n... ... ...\c\n[VAR GENDBR(00FF,0403)]SirLady [VAR TRNAME(0000)]? A fine name.

Of course, ma’am!\c\nIf you are willing to speak for h[VAR GENDBR(00FF,0202)]imer,\nLady Viola, then that is more than sufficient.\c\nAnd besides...\c\nI, too, sense extraordinary potential emanating\nfrom young [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0403)]SirLady [VAR TRNAME(0000)].

Trainers with noble titles can do battle against\nother Trainers with titles in the nobility here\r\nat the Battle Chateau.\c\nThe title of Baron or Baroness places you at the\nlowest rank of nobility. Continue to battle here, and\r\nyour victories will increase your rank and your title.\c\nThen it’s likely that higher-ranking members of the\nnobility will appear in hope of fighting you, sir.

[VAR TRNAME(0000)]! Wait a second!
I’ve been thinking ever since\nall that trouble in Geosenge.
Lysandre chose only Team Flare.\c\nYou and I chose everyone but Team Flare.\c\nBut since our positions forced our hands,\nyou can’t really say any of us were right.
That’s why I feel that...\c\nIf both sides have something to say,\nmaybe it’s best to meet halfway...
So, I made a decision...\c\nFrom now on, I don’t want to battle just to win\nbut to see how you and your Pokémon\r\nthink and feel!\c\nThat’s the kind of Pokémon Battle\nI’m going to have with you right now!
It’s hard to put a finger on it exactly,\nbut I feel like you and I are alike.\r\nAnd that’s why I didn’t want to lose to you.\c\nBut I think the reason we’re so alike\nis because we have so many things in common.\r\nI’m really happy that we’re friends...
I’m renewing my rivalry with you!\c\nSince you’re my rival, I want you to become\na stronger and stronger Pokémon Trainer.
We’ll keep getting stronger, too, of course!\c\nI suppose the first step is mastering the\npower that comes from the bond between\r\nme and my Pokémon, just like you did!\c\nDo your best at the Pokémon League!\nAn awesome Trainer like you can handle it!
[VAR TRNAME(0000)]! Wait up!

It’s hard to put a finger on where,\nbut I think you and I are alike.\r\nAnd that’s why I didn’t want to lose to you.\c\nBut I think the reason we’re alike\nis because we have so much in common.\r\nI’m really happy that we’re friends.
I’m renewing my rivalry with you!\c\nSince you’re my rival, I hope you get stronger\nand stronger as a Pokémon Trainer.
But we’ll keep getting stronger and stronger, too!\c\nI can master the power that comes from the bond\nbetween me and my Pokémon, just like you did!\c\nPower right on through the Pokémon League!\nI know you can do it!
Even if you’re proceeding slowly, keep walking.\nIf you do, you’ll reach your dream.

You know what this place is?\c\nWelcome to the Pokémon Village.\nThis place is a secret, y’know?
Most of the Pokémon here are runaways--escaped\nfrom bad people who did awful things to them.\c\nIt’s a shame how many heartless Trainers who can’t\nbother to care for their Pokémon are out there.\c\nSome of these Pokémon, though...\nSome of ’em are just too strong and found they\r\ndidn’t really have a place in the outside world,\r\nso they came here.
Hmm... I see.\c\nYour Pokémon sure seem to think highly of you.\nYou’ve had some good times together,\r\nhaven’t you?
Hey! You all can come out now.\nThis one’s all right!
Sometimes I get worried and come here to\ncheck on everyone.\c\nOh--excuse my manners. We haven’t even had a\nproper introduction yet. The name’s Wulfric.\c\nI’m usually over at the Gym in Snowbelle City,\nsince I’m the Gym Leader and all.\c\nLet me guess--you want to challenge me?
That’s right.
Not really.
I thought so. Sorry to inconvenience you like this.\nI’ll be waiting for you back at the Gym, then.\c\nBefore you come by, I think it would do you good\nto spend some time with the Pokémon here.
Now you’re just being modest.\nYou have seven Badges already, haven’t you?\c\nThere’s only me left to challenge, so I’ll be\nwaiting for you back at the Gym.\c\nBefore you come by, I think it would do you good\nto spend some time with the Pokémon here.
Oh! The Pokémon has\nsomething in its mouth.
Bouaf!
Fouaf!
Fwa!
Mya myaow!
Oh! The Pokémon has\nsomething in its mouth.
Chi-chiirp!
A Snorlax lies deep in slumber.\nLooks like it’s having some good dreams!

It’s really cold in here, isn’t it, [VAR TRNICK(0000)]?
Is there something going on up ahead?
This Abomasnow is a fine specimen!\nIt’s absolutely brimming with energy.\c\nThe more we agitate it, the stronger its\nSnow Warning Ability becomes, making\r\nthe snow fall even more furiously.
Let’s catch it swiftly and get out of here.
Snowww...
Hey!
Hey, you Poké Ball thieves!\nWhat are you doing here?!
What does it look like?\c\nWe’re catching Pokémon. Why else would we\nhave grabbed all of those Poké Balls?
It was all so we could catch powerful Pokémon\nlike this Abomasnow. It’s full of potent energy!
Energy?
You’re not the brightest one, are you?\c\nWhoever has the most Pokémon and the most\nenergy will come out on top!\c\nLazy people who just wait for things to be\nhanded to them don’t get to have these resources!
But why is Team Flare amassing\nPokémon, energy, and money?\c\nTo put it another way, why is\nTeam Flare always trying to\r\ntake everything for itself?
Allow me to spell it out for you! It’s so\nTeam Flare--and only Team Flare--can survive!\c\nAfter all, why should we care about saving\npeople who aren’t on our side?\c\nAnyway, I don’t mind a healthy curiosity, but I’m\nafraid I just don’t have any more time for you.
[VAR TRNICK(0000)]...\c\nDid they say only Team Flare will survive?\nThese people have a few screws loose...
You two--hurry up and send these kids packing!
Yes, ma’am!
Right away!
Let’s go! Team Flare!\c\nThis is the trademark pose of Team Flare!\nIt’s the very definition of fashionable!
I may have lost... I may have lost, but...\nIsn’t this winter wonderland beautiful?\r\nAlmost as beautiful as the Team Flare pose...
You’d better chill it with the questions\nand mind your manners, kid.
Yikes! Um... If I’m facing Mightyena,\nI should be using...
Hmm... You’re more powerful than you look.\nI wonder how much energy there is inside you.
Hrmph!\nI’ve no patience for losing.
Let’s get out of here!
Doesn’t battling with Team Flare\nscare you, [VAR TRNICK(0000)]?\c\nI’ll admit it scares me. I don’t\nlike battling them...
But we managed to protect Abomasnow by\npitching in there.\c\nI know I’m the reserved type, and I’m OK with that,\nbut it’s important to be bold when necessary.
Mamoswine doesn’t have to worry about\nAbomasnow anymore, and that’s what matters.\r\nAll’s well that ends well!
Snooowww!
What’s this? It looks like Abomasnow\nwants to give you something...

Is something wrong in the\nFrost Cavern, Mamoswine?
Swi swi...
Are you headed to the Frost Cavern, Trainer?
This Mamoswine here usually can’t get enough\nof giving people rides on Route 17, but...\c\nThese days, it seems to be too worried about\nsomething in the Frost Cavern to give rides.
Mamoswine is a Pokémon that loves cold climates.\c\nSo, maybe it has sensed something amiss in\nthe Frost Cavern.
And you are?
My name is Trevor.\c\nI’m researching the distribution of Pokémon in the\nKalos region at Professor Sycamore’s request.
I see. So that’s why you’re walking\nclear out to the Frost Cavern, then.\c\nMamoswine seems concerned about\nsomething over there, so be careful.
I will. Thank you.

Or, with a contribution of just $5,000,000,\nyou could become a member of Team Flare.\c\nIt’s a no-brainer!
What in the world are you Team Flare\nfools thinking?!\c\nI’ll never forgive any group that tries\nto take all the Poké Balls for itself!
Forget it.\nQuit wasting your time with this person.
I agree.\c\nThere’s no one we can use here.\nLet’s blow this place to smithereens.
Well, what do we have here?\nAn intruder?

We’ll see about that!
I can’t let you do that.
Sorry I’m late!
Sorry to have kept you waiting!
There’s another one?
One kid or two, it doesn’t make a lot\nof difference.\c\nWhen we’re the ones fighting together,\nour odds of victory increase exponentially!
You might want to check your numbers.\nAre you really even scientists?
Can you help me fight them, neighbor?
Let’s go!
Got it!
I think your math is off.\nAnd I thought you were supposed to be scientists!
Are you ready to fight alongside\nme, neighbor?
Let’s get ’em!
Got it!
I hope you get the tar beat out of you...\nIf you’re scared, you’d better run...
Double Battles let you cover\neach other’s weaknesses.
In Double Battles, both Pokémon\nuse some powerful moves!
Please help...\nI beg you...
Oh my, oh my?
So lame! What a shame!\nWe got beat!
Enough already!\c\nWe’ve already stolen the Poké Balls,\nGreat Balls, and Ultra Balls.\c\nLet’s call it good and leave.
You saved us!\nThank you so much!
You’re astounding Pokémon Trainers\nfor being so young.\c\nVery well, then.\nI want to show my appreciation.\c\nI’ll give you a Master Ball or a Big Nugget.\nPick whichever one you’d like.
I think you should pick first.
Go ahead and pick first.
I’ll give you a Master Ball or a Big Nugget.\nPick whichever one you’d like.

And here you go!
And as a bonus, you can have the one\nyou didn’t pick as well!
And for you, too, of course!
Th-thank you!\nThis seems like a lot...
Oh. Thank you.
I just have a feeling you two will put them\nto great use.\r\nYou’re different from those Team Flare people.\c\nOh, and even I don’t know the proper\nway to use a Big Nugget.
Still...\nThat blasted Team Flare.\c\nWhat were they planning to accomplish\nby taking all the Poké Balls for themselves...
Without Poké Balls,\npeople can’t catch Pokémon.\c\nWhich means many people won’t be\nable to make friends with Pokémon.
No matter the tool, what’s important\nare the feelings of the people using it.
So, they stole Poké Balls, right?\c\nThat means they must be planning something\nthey need many Pokémon for.\c\nI heard that Team Flare was also behind the\ntrouble at the Power Plant.\c\nPokémon... And electricity...\nWhat could they be after?

If all Poké Balls are stolen, there won’t be\nany Poké Balls to buy at Poké Marts!\c\nJust one might cost $1,000,000!
Poké Balls have infinite possibilities.\c\nJust what kind of effects have they\nhad on us humans?
If Poké Balls are stolen by Team Flare,\nwe can’t become friends with Pokémon...
Team Flare...\nWhat are they conspiring to do?
The thing that lets you become friends\nwith Pokémon. That’s a Poké Ball.

Team Flare is on fire!\nBut I’ll stay cool as I take you down!

We’re hard at work making Poké Balls,\nbut there still aren’t enough...
Everything’s finally back to normal!\c\nIf you see a Pokémon you want to travel with,\nmake sure to throw a Poké Ball at it, OK?
Hey, do you think it’s OK\nto go have a look around now?
I’m sorry...\nTeam Flare messed everything up.\r\nIt’s not a good time right now.
I’m afraid not.\c\nIt’s not the time for that now.\nThey still have to clean up after Team Flare.
Team Flare?\nHave I heard that name somewhere?
Would they be the people in the\nred suits from a minute ago?
That’s right, Trevor.\nTeam Flare...\c\n...\n...
Right.\nTeam Flare...\c\n...\n...
They took all of the Poké Balls by force?\nBut they’re for everybody to use!
How awful...\c\nIt seems like it would be best not\nto get involved with those guys.
You’re right, Trevs.\nTeam Flare sure is terrible.\c\nWhat should we do now?\c\nAccording to the Town Map,\nDendemille Town is next...

Hey, [VAR TRNICK(0000)]!
If you use the move Flash, not as many\nwild Pokémon will turn up.
I kinda depend on Flash.\c\nI’m still not very good at battling,\nso I keep running into trouble...\c\nI sure wish I could be as good as you.
Check the condition of your Pokémon before\ndeciding whether to go back or press onward.
If your Pokémon are in good health, press onward.\nIf they’re not, it’s time to rest and recover!

There may be more than one example of\nthe Reveal Glass first found in Unova.\c\nThat’s what the latest research seems\nto suggest. It’s a real breakthrough!\c\nOh, sorry. Don’t you know?

Oh! That Pokémon with you!\nThat is [VAR PKNAME(0000)] of legend!\r\nThen take this, won’t you?
If you use that Reveal Glass, you will\nbe able to turn Tornadus, Thundurus,\r\nor Landorus back into its true Forme.\c\nOf course, no one really knows whether\nthe Therian Forme or the Incarnate Forme\r\nis its true Forme...

That’s right!\nWe need the flute to wake up Snorlax.
Sigh...\nThe Poké Flute, huh...
Go get it.
It was Shabboneau Castle’s treasure,\nbut I took it as payment for a loan.\c\nA rich guy like me and a common person\nlike that just didn’t go together.
Give it to them.
Here is the Poké Flute.
Listen well, you two!\c\nAlways return what you borrow.\nThat’s very important.

You can’t imagine how stressful running\nthis place is for him...
That may be so, but...\c\nOh, that’s right.\c\nMr. Butler, do you know anything\nabout Mega Evolution?
I remember reading a book on that subject\nin the palace library.\c\nIt had something to do with what you’d now\ncall a Trainer holding a mysterious stone high\r\nand making Pokémon evolve even further.\c\nAlso, it’s not much, but I would like you to\nhave this.
Protect blocks opposing Pokémon’s moves.\c\nBut if you use it many times in a row,\nthe chances of it not working increase.\c\nIf you will excuse me. I shall take my leave.

I heard that a forbidden tome once existed\nthat contained the secret to bringing\r\nPokémon back to life.\c\nIt’s probably just a rumor, though. We’ve certainly\ngot nothing of the sort in our library!
Various books about Pokémon, science, and\ngeography line the shelves.
There’s a book called “The Transforming Pokémon\nand the Mysterious Stone” on the shelf.\c\nIt’s about a certain incident that\noccurred in Shalour City.\c\nSomething about a Pokémon that changes its\nform at the beginning of a battle.\c\nThe person next to the Pokémon\nis holding a mysterious stone...\r\nCould that have something to do with it?
No way!\c\nCould that be the Mythical Pokémon\nHoopa that you have there with you?
Oh, I was mistaken?\nSorry about that...
Whoaaa!\nI can’t believe it’s true!\c\nSee, I travel around the world, trying\nto solve its many mysteries.
I’ve been researching supernatural events that\nhave occurred over the last 100 years.\c\nOne thing I’ve found is that the Mythical\nPokémon Hoopa is connected to many\r\nof these strange events!\c\nI’ve also managed to come across some\ninformation about the mysterious power\r\nthat Hoopa appears to wield.
So, without further ado, I’d like to share my\nfindings with you!\c\nAfter all, you’re actually traveling with\nHoopa--the very subject of my research!
You’ve come back! Do you want\nto know something about Hoopa?
What would you like to know about Hoopa?
Its mysterious rings
The secret of its lair
Its deeds and exploits
Nothing
It’s said that Hoopa can use the power of the\nthree rings it adorns itself with to move objects\r\nabout as it pleases...\c\nThat’s not all! I’ve also heard that when Hoopa\nunleashes its full power, the size of the rings can\r\ngrow up to multiple miles in length!\c\nWith such massive rings, apparently it can\ntransport even entire islands!
It’s said that Hoopa’s lair is overflowing with\nthe objects and treasures it nabbed over the\r\nyears, claiming them for its own.\c\nRumor has it that there are mountains of gold and\nsilver treasures that it took from ancient kings and\r\nwealthy land barons.\c\nI hear that Hoopa’s lair is in an oasis in the desert,\nbut no one’s been able to find the place!
There’s a tale about an organization that tried to\nmanipulate Hoopa’s power for their own benefit.\c\nAfter a while, certain objects that belonged to the\norganization mysteriously began to disappear.\c\nEverything from weapons and vehicles to money...\nIt all began to vanish one by one.\c\nThe organization got scared and decided to hole\nup inside of their headquarters.\c\nOnce they did, things stopped disappearing!\nJust like that!\c\nRelieved that it was finally over, the organization\nfinally decided to step outside.\c\nIt was then that they discovered their headquarters\nhad been transported wholesale to somewhere in\r\nthe middle of a desert!\c\nTerrified of what they had unleashed, the\norganization promptly disbanded.
Just say the word, and I’ll share\nmy knowledge with you.
Whether Hoopa becomes a trustworthy partner\nor ends up bringing about great misfortune\r\ndepends entirely on the Trainer.\c\nI hope you don’t forget that.
I think Hoopa’ll turn out right as rain\nwith you at its side, though!\c\nYou look like a Trainer who knows how to take\ncare of h[VAR GENDBR(00FF,0202)]iser Pokémon and treat ’em right.\c\nWell, I hope you end up having lots of fine\nadventures with Hoopa! Have fun!
Is there anything else you’d like to know?
The Pokémon called Hoopa is linked to many of\nthe unexplained supernatural events that have\r\noccurred in this world.\c\nMy search for Hoopa has led me to this library.

Whenever your\nPokémon get too down or run out\r\nof HP like that, you can always come\r\nhome and let them rest for a while.\c\nIf you’re headed far from home, you\nshould buy some Potions at the Poké Mart\r\nin Aquacorde Town or someplace.\c\nTaking proper care of your Pokémon\nis one of the basics for a Trainer!\c\nNow get back out there and show\nthe world what you’ve got! Love you!
First, let’s restore your Pokémon to full health.
Please visit a Pokémon Center if\nyour Pokémon’s HP goes down.\c\nIf you’re planning to travel any\ngreat distance, you should stock\r\nup on Potions at a Poké Mart.\c\nGood luck out there, Trainer!
There! All happy and healthy!\c\nGood luck and take care!

I’m the number one apprentice of [VAR MIINAME(0000)].\c\nI’ll do my best, so don’t give up on me.
Hey, I know [VAR MIINAME(0000)].\nWell, I’m kinda [VAR MIINAME(0000)]’s pal!\c\nI’ll help ya out, but don’t drag me down!
Do you know an awesome Trainer\nnamed [VAR MIINAME(0000)]?\c\nI’m a friend of the awesome Trainer.\c\nToday, I’ll lend you my amazing muscle\nand help you out.
[VAR MIINAME(0000)]...\nis my BEST friend...\c\nI WILL FIGHT BESIDE YOU...\nI WILL KNOCK ALL YOUR ENEMIES DOWN...
Hey! I’m a favorite apprentice of [VAR MIINAME(0000)],\nwhose name quiets a screaming child!\c\nI can’t bring disgrace on my teacher,\nso I’ll get psyched up for battle!
Me and [VAR MIINAME(0000)]?\nWe have a rather ambivalent relationship.\c\nWe’re more than strangers but less than best\nfriends.\c\nWhat kind of relationship will you and I have?\nAnyway, let’s do our best together!
[VAR MIINAME(0000)] and I are kindred souls...\c\nA pleasure to meet you.
I’m [VAR MIINAME(0000)]’s best friend!\c\nI’ll lead you to victory so I won’t disgrace\nmy friend’s name.
Eek! If I report this kind of result to\n[VAR MIINAME(0000)],\r\nI’ll be in trouble.
That’s too bad, but these things happen!\c\n[VAR MIINAME(0000)] would say so and laugh it off!
Ugh... I’m so ashamed...\nI’ll start my training with [VAR MIINAME(0000)]\r\nover from the beginning.
GRR... I’M FED UP.\nI’m going BACK to [VAR MIINAME(0000)]’s place...
Argh... I’m so sorry...\nMy teacher, [VAR MIINAME(0000)]...
Ahh. That’s too bad.\c\nWell, even with a poor result,\nI’m sure [VAR MIINAME(0000)] will cheer me up,\r\nso I’m OK.
Gah... Bitterly disappointing...\c\n[VAR MIINAME(0000)]...\nSorry...
I’m too embarrassed to face [VAR MIINAME(0000)]!\c\nPlease start the next challenge already!\nWe’ll start winning next fight!
We...we...can challenge the\nSuper Multi Battles!\c\nI’ll let [VAR MIINAME(0000)]\nknow the result!
We cleared the Multi Battles!\nHaha! We did it!\c\nI should go brag about this to [VAR MIINAME(0000)]!
We made it mainly because of me...\nYou should thank me, of course.\c\nI’m going to tell [VAR MIINAME(0000)] about this.
You’re STRONG! You’re GREAT!\c\nYou’re HALF as good as [VAR MIINAME(0000)]!
You’re seriously awesome!\nI wanna battle with you again!\c\nI respect you as much as I\nrespect [VAR MIINAME(0000)]!
Yay! I owe it all to you!\c\nWell, I’m gonna go to [VAR MIINAME(0000)]’s place\nto brag about this!
You and I...\nOur two spirits led us to this answer...
You were as strong as [VAR MIINAME(0000)]!\c\nI wouldn’t mind teaming up with you again!
Eh? Eh? Are you leaving?\nNo... What shall I...
Do you have some errands to run?\nOh well. Let’s battle together again!
So, we’re stopping here this time?\nAll right. See you again...
YOU GO HOME...\nI GO HOME...
Well, that wasn’t bad! Guess we should lay off of\nthem for a bit.
What? Is that all?\nI could keep fighting!
Are you exhausted body and soul?\nOK, then, next time...
What’s the matter? We’re on a roll!\nDo you have to go to the restroom?
You and I have very different goals,\nbut if we come together and click,\r\nnobody can beat us!
We didn’t really click, did we?\c\nDid our egos get in the way of understanding\nwhat the other wanted to do?
It’s exactly because we’re so different,\nthat when we click, both of us have a power\r\nand style we don’t have when we’re alone.
That’s OK, I guess...\nIt’s a shame, but let’s call it quits.
If we both respect one another and\ndo our very best, no one will be able to beat us!
The battle may not have turned out great,\nbut I tried my best to get to know you better.
I really like fighting as one with my\nPokémon and winning battles.\c\nI enjoyed working as a team\nwith you to win, too.
All right... Can’t be helped, I suppose.\nMight as well call it good.
If it’s with you, [VAR TRNICK(0001)],\neverything is fun! 
Oh... I’ll do better next time!
[VAR TRNICK(0001)], you’re really great!\c\nHaving amazing friends like you makes\nme feel like I’ve become great, too!♪
Aww...\nIf you say so...
When I join forces with you, [VAR TRNICK(0001)],\nI feel like we can beat anybody!
Sorry ’bout that!\c\nThose cool Pokémon moves might’ve\ndistracted me from the battle a little...
I saw tons and tons of Pokémon moves!\nI’ve had my fill for now!
Hey what? Done already?\nSome other time, then, ’K?
[VAR TRNICK(0001)].\c\nLet me demonstrate the knowledge I’ve\ngained from filling up the Pokédex.
I’ve heard it a lot, but...\c\nIt’s one thing to know something,\nbut it’s another thing entirely\r\nto put it to good use...
[VAR TRNICK(0001)], you really\nknow a great deal about Pokémon.\c\nActually, that’s not why you’re good, is it?\c\nI’m sure the real reason you’re such a great\nbattler is that you’re kind to Pokémon.
Oh? Done already?\c\nAnd I thought we were just\nabout to really get going, too...
Sigh... I do Sky Battles only.\nIf there were no roof, I could\r\ntake on the challengers, too...
The second floor is a viewing area\nfor people who don’t battle.\c\nI’m watching battles and guessing\nwho will make it to the end.
I’m just watching battles with my girlfriend.\c\nChallengers like you don’t know this, but\nspectators have to pay an admission fee.
Have you already met the four\nBattle Chatelaines?\c\nThey’re the owners of the Battle Maison.\nThey’re four strong yet elegant sisters!\c\nIf you keep winning in battles,\nthey’ll appear in front of you!\c\nMy favorite Chatelaine is, of course,\nthe first daughter, Mademoiselle Morgan,\r\nwho specializes in Rotation Battles!\r\nNo one else!\c\nThe minute you see her, I guarantee that\nyou’ll feel the same way!
Hisssss
Huh? Do you want me to restore\nyour Pokémon’s health?\c\n...Listen. As you can see,\nI’m taking a day off today.\c\nOnce I leave the Pokémon Center,\nI’m an ordinary girl, OK?\c\nI’m quite stressed out from work.\nToday, I’m letting the stress out\r\nby watching battles.\c\nWhen I go back to work, I’ll do my job,\nso please leave me alone today, OK?
Ugh...ugh...\c\nMy muse, Mademoiselle Evelyn, won’t show up\non the stage...\c\nIf I can’t see her dainty face, my fingers won’t\ndance on the cash register tomorrow...\c\nYou! You’re a Trainer, right?\nPlease keep winning in Double Battles!\c\nI can’t go home unless I see Mademoiselle\nEvelyn, who flourishes on the stage!
Perfect combinations between\nstrong Trainers and Pokémon.\c\nPokémon battles here are\nserious battles.
I...I...want to be...\n[VAR MIINAME(0000)]’s apprentice.\c\nI’ll do my best and battle it out,\nso, um...thank you in advance\r\nfor your guidance.
I wanna be [VAR MIINAME(0000)]’s pal.\c\nAnyway, let’s do our best today!
I’m training every day to be\n[VAR MIINAME(0000)]’s friend.\c\nToday, I’ll battle here\ninstead of training.
I think I can be [VAR MIINAME(0000)]’s\nBEST friend.\c\nBut today, I will battle\nwith YOU...
My dream is to be [VAR MIINAME(0000)]’s\napprentice!\c\nToday, I use this battle as training\nand do my best!
I want to have a close relationship\nwith [VAR MIINAME(0000)].\c\nIf I do well here, I might get noticed.\nSo, I’ll get psyched up!
I’m feeling that [VAR MIINAME(0000)]’s and\nmy minds are connected...\r\nI feel the bond between us...\c\nEven now, I feel I can hear\n[VAR MIINAME(0000)]’s voice, saying “Fight...”
I believe that [VAR MIINAME(0000)] and I\nwill be best friends very soon.\c\nI will lead you to victory so\nI won’t disgrace my future friend!
Hee... I can’t be [VAR MIINAME(0000)]’s\napprentice with such a result.
With such a pathetic result,\n[VAR MIINAME(0000)] won’t approve me\r\nas a pal.
Ahh... This is terrible...\c\nWith such a result, [VAR MIINAME(0000)]\nwon’t accept me as a friend...
ARGH... I’m tired...\n[VAR MIINAME(0000)]...\r\nI’m hungry...
I want to be strong just like\n[VAR MIINAME(0000)].
I wish I could be strong like\n[VAR MIINAME(0000)]...
I feel [VAR MIINAME(0000)]’s soulful voice\nsaying, “Go home...”
[VAR MIINAME(0000)]... I’m too embarrassed\nto face my future friend.
We...we can now challenge\nSuper Multi Battles!\c\nI wonder if [VAR MIINAME(0000)] will\naccept me as an apprentice!
We cleared Multi Battles...\nI think we can be a good team.
Not only my great performance\nbut also [VAR MIINAME(0000)],\r\nwho’s probably cheering for me,\r\nbrought this awesome result...
I am as strong as\n[VAR MIINAME(0000)], RIGHT?
Teacher, [VAR MIINAME(0000)]...\nWere you watching me?
I guess this is the result that I can\nbrag about to [VAR MIINAME(0000)].
I can hear [VAR MIINAME(0000)]’s soulful voice\nsaying, “Congratulations...”
I wonder if [VAR MIINAME(0000)] accepts\nme as a friend.
Eh? Eh? Are you leaving?\nNo... What shall I...
Do you have some errands to run?\nOh well. Let’s battle together again!
Are we going to stop here?\nAll right. See you again...
YOU GO HOME...\nI GO HOME...
Well, that wasn’t bad! Guess we should lay off of\nthem for a bit.
What? Is that all?\nI could fight more!
Are you exhausted in body and mind?\nOK, then, next time...
What’s the matter? We’re on a roll!\nDo you have to go to the restroom?
Here she comes,\nBattle Chatelaine Nita!
Here she comes,\nBattle Chatelaine Evelyn!
Here she comes,\nBattle Chatelaine Dana!
Here she comes,\nBattle Chatelaine Morgan!
Here they come, Battle Chatelaines\nEvelyn and Dana!
Here they come, Battle Chatelaines\nMorgan and Evelyn!
Here they come, Battle Chatelaines\nMorgan and Nita!
Here they come, Battle Chatelaines\nNita and Dana!

’Scuse me! Got a minute?\c\nYou look like you know a lot about Pokémon.\nCould you use your knowledge to help me out?
Hey, thanks!\nHere’s what I’m wondering about.\c\nUsually, Ground-type moves can’t hit a Pokémon\nwith the Levitate Ability.\c\nBut I’m sure there’s some way to do it.\nI just can’t for the life of me figure out how...\c\nI have several ideas, but I can’t decide which\none to try.\c\nThat’s why I want your opinion on the matter!
Oh... Well, can’t be helped.\c\nIf you ever change your mind, I’d still like to\npick your brain...
First, I’d like some advice about items.\c\nSee, I want to use Trick or Switcheroo to give\nan item to a Pokémon that has the Levitate\r\nAbility so I can hit it with Ground-type moves!\c\nAfter wondering about what item I should give,\nI thought an Iron Ball might work.\r\nI’m not sure, though...\c\nWhat do you think?\nIs an Iron Ball a good idea?
That’s fine
OK
All right
Oh! I knew it!\c\nBut hearing you say it makes me feel much more\nconfident!\c\nSo passing an Iron Ball to a Pokémon with Levitate\nmeans Ground-type moves can hit it!\c\nThanks!
I’d like to pick your brain again.\nIs that OK?
I’d like to get your advice on moves.\c\nIf I use a certain move on a Pokémon with the\nLevitate Ability and then use a Ground-type\r\nmove on it, I think it could work.\c\nWhich move should I choose:\nSmack Down, Gravity, or Gastro Acid?
Smack Down
Gravity
Gastro Acid
Of course! Smack Down!\c\nIt will knock a Flying-type Pokémon, or a Pokémon\nwith Levitate, out of the air, so Ground-type moves\r\nwill work on it!\c\nSo if I use Smack Down and then use a Ground-\ntype move...\c\nYes! I get it now! Thanks!
That’s it! Gravity!\c\nThe move Gravity makes gravity stronger, so any\nGround-type moves will work on Pokémon with\r\nthe Levitate Ability or Flying-type Pokémon.\c\nSo if I use Gravity and then a Ground-type move...\c\nYes! I get it now! Thanks!
I see! Gastro Acid!\c\nThat’s right--Gastro Acid eliminates the effects\nof Abilities.\c\nThat means Levitate won’t work anymore!\c\nSo if I use Gastro Acid and then use a Ground-\ntype move...\c\nYes! I get it now! Thanks!
I promise, this is the last time!\nBut I’d like a little advice about Abilities.\c\nApparently some Abilities let you hit Pokémon\nthat have Levitate with Ground-type moves!\c\nBut...\nI’m not sure which one to use!\c\nMold Breaker, Teravolt, and Turboblaze all seem\nlike pretty good choices...\c\nI’m close, but I can’t decide.\c\nHelp! Please decide for me!
Mold Breaker
Teravolt
Turboblaze
So you’d say Mold Breaker, then?\c\nThat’s right, huh? Mold Breaker lets you use\nmoves regardless of the target’s Ability.\c\nLevitate won’t matter, so you can land hit after\nhit with Ground-type moves!\c\nMan, Mold Breaker’s so cool! Viva Mold Breaker!
Oh, you say Teravolt?!\c\nYou’re totally right! Teravolt lets you use moves\nregardless of the target’s Ability!\c\nLevitate won’t matter, so you can land hit after\nhit with Ground-type moves!\c\nMan, Teravolt’s so cool! Viva Teravolt!
So you say Turboblaze?!\c\nOf course! Duh! Turboblaze lets you use moves\nregardless of the target’s Ability!\c\nLevitate won’t matter, so you can land hit after hit\nwith Ground-type moves!\c\nMan, Turboblaze is so cool! Viva Turboblaze!
Thanks! Because of you, I’m prepared for Levitate!\c\nAnd more importantly, I’m prepared for any and\nall anti-Levitate tactics!\c\nHeh heh heh...\c\nNow, no matter which Pokémon I face, victory\nis assured for my levitating Pokémon!
Well! Do you dare battle my invincible Pokémon\nwith the Levitate Ability?
Hmm...\c\nI thought I was completely prepared for anti-\nLevitate tactics...\c\nBut in real battles, things never seem to go quite\nas smoothly as you expect.\c\nOr maybe you’re just that good!
If you want to battle, come talk to me again!\nI’ll take you on anytime!

Impressive!\c\nYour Pokémon fought with great courage.\nI can tell that you’ve trained your Pokémon well.
[VAR TRNAME(0000)] received the\nIceberg Badge from Wulfric!
What you have right there is called the\nIceberg Badge!\c\nAs long as you have that, any and all of your\nPokémon will surely look up to you and do their\r\nabsolute best in battle.\c\nLet me give you this, too.
You know what this is?\nIt’s Ice Beam!\c\nThis move has an accuracy of 100 percent!\c\nNot only that, but every once in a while it will\nfreeze the target it hits, too!
I hope you’ve learned a valuable lesson today.\c\nBeing rigid can make you tough, but it will also\nrender you fragile. You’re better off being flexible.\c\nYou know what I mean?\c\nSome people are fluid like water and can adapt\nto their environment without changing what’s\r\nimportant on the inside.\c\nNot me, though. I guess I’m too stubborn.\nMaybe that’s why I love Ice types.
Ice-type Pokémon are cold to the touch.\nGive one a hug and you’re in for a chill.\c\nBut you know what?\c\nThey’re only cold on the outside. On the inside,\nthey have hearts as warm as anyone!
What’s the dice, chunk of ice?\nHow’s my favorite future Champ?
As you can see, this Snowbelle City Gym\nis the place to be if you love Ice types!\c\nBut you’ve already seized seven Badges\nfrom Gym Leaders all across Kalos, right?\c\nI’m sure you don’t need any hints from a\nguy like me anymore! Am I right? Right!\c\nOne more to go, eh? Go show ’em what\nyou’re made of, future Champ!

Why, hello there. You must be that apprentice of\nProfessor Sycamore’s I’ve heard so much about.\c\nIt’s my guess that you’ve come to ask about the\nLegendary Pokémon of the Kalos region, Xerneas.\c\nWell, allow me to tell you what I know.
It happened around 800 years ago.\c\nThe Pokémon known as Xerneas used its\nshining horns to illuminate the lands of Kalos.\c\nAt that very moment, people and Pokémon\nthroughout the land felt great energy and\r\nvitality surge through their bodies.\c\nAt the same time, a vast forest sprang up,\nwith Xerneas at its center.
Legend has it that, when it nears the end of\nits thousand-year life span, Xerneas releases\r\nall of its remaining energy, sharing it with all\r\nliving things nearby.\c\nThere’s another story I know that talks of the\nappearance of just such a fortuitous Pokémon.
Back 3,000 years ago, the Kalos region was\nengulfed in a terrible war. So the tale goes, a\r\nPokémon came to the rescue of all of the wounded\r\nPokémon that had been caught up in the conflict.\c\nSome people suspect the Pokémon that appeared\nwas Xerneas, but there’s no way to know.\c\nMaybe they just wished a Legendary Pokémon had\ncome to the rescue to brighten a tale of woe.
Supposedly, after Xerneas released its remaining\nenergy, it transformed into a dried-up tree.\c\nIt remains in hiding deep within the forest.\nAccording to old tales, as I say. Stories and tales.
Why, hello there. You must be that apprentice of\nProfessor Sycamore’s I’ve heard so much about.\c\nIt’s my guess that you’ve come to ask about the\nLegendary Pokémon of the Kalos region, Yveltal.\c\nWell, allow me to tell you what I know.
It happened around 800 years ago.\c\nThe Pokémon known as Yveltal spread its ominous\nwings, engulfing the lands of Kalos in darkness.\c\nAt that moment, people and Pokémon throughout\nthe land began to fall one by one.\c\nYveltal let out a piercing cry and took to\nthe sky, vanishing to an unknown location.
Stories say that when it nears the end of its\nthousand-year life span, Yveltal absorbs the life\r\nforce of the living things around it in order to\r\ncharge its own energy.\c\nAnother tale talks of the appearance of just such\na terrifying Pokémon.
Back 3,000 years ago, the Kalos region was\nengulfed in a terrible war. According to the stories,\r\na Pokémon appeared and stole the life force of\r\ncountless living beings.\c\nSome people suspect the Pokémon that appeared\nwas Yveltal, but there’s no way to know.\c\nMaybe they’re just using a Legendary Pokémon\nas a metaphor for war and pestilence.
In the tales, after Yveltal finished storing the energy\nit had absorbed, it transformed into a kind of\r\ncocoon, remaining in hiding deep in the mountains.\c\nAccording to old tales, as I say. Tales and stories.
What happened to that strange bunch\nof folks in their red outfits?\c\nI wonder if they’re still out there,\nseeking Legendary Pokémon.\c\nA few years back, some people came\naround here, asking the same questions.
I heard about the incident in Geosenge Town.\nThey say that the strange group dressed in red\r\nmanaged to find Xerneas asleep somewhere.\c\nA few years back, a different group of people\ncame around here, asking the same questions.

My Pokémon are so much stronger now, but you\nand your Pokémon are still one step ahead of us...\c\nAnyway, I’ll heal your Pokémon. Here.
You and your Pokémon are good enough to beat\nthe Gym Leader.\c\nGo for it!

My Pokémon are a lot stronger now,\nbut you and your Pokémon are still just\r\na little bit out of our reach...\c\nHere, I should heal your Pokémon.
You’re strong.\c\nI knew there would be lots of tough\nTrainers out in the world, but I wouldn’t\r\nhave guessed that my neighbor would\r\nturn out to be the one to beat!\c\nWell, just keep doing what you’re doing\nand defeat that Gym Leader.
I’m sure getting the Psychic Badge\nwasn’t too much trouble for you.\c\nRight, [VAR TRNICK(0000)]?
I think I’ll challenge you to a daily battle\nwhen this trip is all said and done.\c\nSeems like the neighborly thing to do!

Why, child, look at your Pokédex...\nHow did you obtain so many Pokémon?\c\nObviously, you caught some by yourself,\nbut you can’t complete the Pokédex\r\nsimply by catching Pokémon, right?\c\nYou probably traded Pokémon with\nyour friends and with people from\r\nall over the world to complete it...\c\nIf that’s the case, the Pokédex is not\nonly a wealth of Pokémon information\r\nbut also a record of your meetings and\r\nyour communication with others.

Why hello, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!
Congratulations!
I see you finally obtained everything\nyou need for Mega Evolution!
A Mega Stone for the Pokémon,\na Mega Ring for the Trainer,\r\nand a strong bond with your Pokémon.
A strong bond?
It’s only a hypothesis, but I think\nthe bond between Pokémon and Trainer\r\nis the key to this new Evolution.\c\nBut what is this bond, exactly?\c\nAnd why are there examples of\nMega Evolution only in the Kalos region?\r\nThere’s still so much we don’t know...
Does this make you think of something\nlike Kalos’s Legendary Pokémon?\c\nFound only here in the Kalos region, right?\nNowhere else? Maybe that’s not a coincidence.
Oh! What an excellent point!\nIndeed!
The more you know, the more there is\nto research!\r\nThe excitement never ends, does it?
Oh, that’s right!\nI came here to give you this!
Use the HM Fly to pop right\nover to Pokémon Centers of\r\nplaces you’ve already visited!\c\nWell then, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]...
Diantha, I hope to see you both again soon!
Bonds... They really are important to us\nall, aren’t they?\c\nWhen I’m acting, I think I’m always trying\nto forge a bond between myself and\r\nthe character I’m playing.\c\nIf all I think about is how I’m nothing like\na character, then I’ll just hate playing it.\c\nBut if I focus on what I have in common\nwith the character and put myself in her\r\nshoes, I might be able to understand her.\c\nIt’s the same for people--or Pokémon.
Oh, never mind me! I’m just babbling\nabout my own things.\c\nLet’s have a battle the next we meet,\nshall we? I’m still looking forward to it!
Tee hee!\c\nEven the movie star Diantha rides the monorail!\nVisitors always have a one-track mind about it!\c\nHow’s that for a one-liner!\nHa ha ha!
Welcome.\nWill you be riding the monorail?
Please talk to the person at the counter\nbefore boarding the monorail.

Ho! So yeh’ve made it clear up here!\nI’m the Gym Leader.

Yeh believe in yer Pokémon...\nAnd they believe in yeh, too...\r\nMighty oaks from acorns grow.\c\nGo on, then. Yeh’ve earned it.\nHere’s yer own Plant Badge, sprout.
[VAR TRNAME(0000)] received the\nPlant Badge from Ramos!
If yeh’ve got yerself a Plant Badge,\nthen yeh can use the HM Fly even\r\nwhen not battling. It’s a real boon.\c\nPokémon up to Lv. 60 will listen to\nyeh, too, easy as falling off a log.\r\nEven if yeh got ’em from a trade.\c\nHere--have this, too. Might as well\nmake hay while the sun shines, I reckon.
That TM there is for Grass Knot. Yeh can\nuse it to trip yer opponent up in the grass.\c\nThe heavier the opponent, the harder it’ll fall--\nand the more it’ll hurt.
Ain’t it a marvel? Frail little blades\no’ grass can break through concrete, even.\r\nI can’t help admirin’ that strength.

How’s the bout, little sprout?
You got it figured out yet, Champ? Yup!\nOld man Ramos’s Gym is all about Grass!\c\nIt’s simple, right? You see a vine hanging\nin front of you, and you just grab right on!\c\nAnd hang on for dear life! That’s maybe\nthe most important part of all, right, pal?

A wandering young Trainer, are you?\c\nLet me guess--you wish to fish\nfor all the Pokémon in the water, right?\r\nI’m sure you do! Shall I lend you a rod?\c\nI’m a fishing fanatic, and I’ve collected\nmore Good Rods than I could ever use!
You really do want to fish for all\nof the Pokémon in the water, huh?\r\nThen how about I give you a rod?
Yeah!
Not now.
Here you are: one Good Rod!\nGo take it for a spin, all right?
Ah hm! What a modest la[VAR GENDBR(00FF,0201)]dss you are, hm?\c\nLook at that lovely, spacious Bag of yours!\nDon’t think you could keep a Good Rod in it?

Oh!

Yes, it was me.

Yep, sure was.
What?! Uh, it was you who\nfound it, RIGHT, [VAR TRNICK(0000)]?
Nothing good comes from lying!\c\nWere you REALLY the one who found that\nIntriguing Stone?
Well, who found it doesn’t really matter.\nWhat’s important is that you were honest.\c\nIf you tell lies, the truth is clouded\nand eventually lost...\c\nAnd while we’re being honest, that\nIntriguing Stone is just an ordinary rock.
Hm? Sure a lot of hubbub out there.\nDoes that mean everyone has arrived?

Haha! Well, [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0100)]she must be something special!\c\nSo, whaddya say, Trainer? Will you and Lucario\nbattle against me and my Lucario?
A Lucario-on-Lucario battle!\nIt will be nothing short of riveting.\c\nThey both have Lucarionite in hand!\nHow about we get this show on the road?
Oh, come on! Both are at the ready\nwith Lucarionite! Let’s battle!
I can feel Lucario’s passion. Perhaps it’s just\nthat it doesn’t want to lose to the other Lucario,\r\nbut it may be that it’s just on the same wavelength\r\nas you...

Let’s give it all we’ve got!

Hmm!\nLooks like everyone is finally here.
[VAR TRNICK(0001)]!
Where have you been?
How are your Pokémon?
It feels like it’s been some time since our\nwhole group has gathered in one place.
Yeah. I think it’s been\nsince we met up on Route 7.
Mr. Mega Evolution Guru...\c\nI’ve been wondering this whole time.\nWho is that over there?
This is my granddaughter Korrina.\nShe’s Shalour City’s Gym Leader.
So, Sycamore’s pupils.\nNow that you’re all here...\c\nI suppose I should explain\nMega Evolution to you.
I assume you all know about\nPokémon Evolution?
I know! I know!\c\nUm...\nYou have your Pokémon battle a lot,\r\nand then they grow stronger and evolve!\c\nOh, and there are Pokémon that\nevolve with certain items. ♪
Some Pokémon evolve through\nfriendship, and others only evolve\r\nin certain places.
Some Pokémon evolve through\nfriendship, and others only evolve\r\nin certain places.
Exactly! And it’s likely that Pokémon\nevolve in a lot of other ways as well!\c\nBut Mega Evolution is an Evolution\nthat transcends all other Evolution!
Indeed!\c\nMega Evolution is a transformation of Pokémon that\nwere thought to be unable to evolve any further!\c\nIt’s a whole new level of power!
So in an Evolutionary line like Charmander,\nCharmeleon, and Charizard...\c\nDoes that mean Charizard would\nbe able to evolve even further?
Yep! Exactly right!\c\nBut not all Pokémon have a Mega Evolution.
There’s a reason why I used the word\n“transformation” a moment ago.\c\nMega Evolution differs from Evolution\nbecause it ends after a certain amount of time.\r\nIn other words, it’s a temporary Evolution.
What?! It evolves, but then it\ngoes back to what it was before?
Yes... Mega Evolution is a special kind of Evolution.\c\nThat said, we still know very little about it.
What we know now is that it requires special items.\c\nAnd the most important element is the trust\nbetween Pokémon and Trainer.
Trust... In other words, the bond\nbetween Trainer and Pokémon!
Trust... In other words, the bond\nbetween Trainer and Pokémon!
To make Mega Evolution work, you need two items:\na Mega Stone for the Pokémon and\r\nthe Mega Ring, which has a mysterious stone set\r\nin it, for the Trainer.
Since Professor Sycamore entrusted\neach one of you with a Pokédex, I would like to\r\ngive these items to all of you...\r\nI’d like to share them with you, but...
But?\c\nBut what?\nJust come out and say it already!
Sorry, but presently, I have only one Mega Ring...\c\nIt’s a very precious item.\nThat’s why my research isn’t getting anywhere...\c\nSo, I want all of you to decide among yourselves\nwhich one of you will be the one who challenges\r\nthe Mega Evolution successor.
I’ll pass. Pokémon battling isn’t really my scene.\c\nSo, Mega Evolution would be way out\nof my league.
Me, too!\c\nIt really would be a cool memory,\nand it does look interesting, but...
I want to complete the Pokédex first.\c\nIf you try to do too much at once,\nyou won’t accomplish anything.
So that leaves [VAR TRNICK(0001)]\nand [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0506)]SerenaCalem, then.
Trainers don’t get much better than you two.
[VAR TRNAME(0000)], let’s battle for it!\c\nWhatever the reason, a battle gives us\nan opportunity to compete and see who\r\nVaniville Town’s best Trainer really is!
[VAR TRNAME(0000)], let’s battle for it!\c\nNo matter what the reason is, a battle is a good\nchance for the two of us to compete and see\r\nwho Vaniville Town’s best Trainer really is!
Let’s see which one of you has more\nlove and trust toward your Pokémon!
Not a bad idea... You can learn\nmany new things by battling!
Oh, wow! I’ll be cheering\nfor both of you! ♪
You’re gonna fight over something\neven though you’re friends?
The stones for Mega Evolution\nare just that precious, I suppose.
Are you ready?
I will master Mega Evolution and set\nmyself apart from other Trainers.\c\nI’ll also do it for my Pokémon--we’ve\ncome so far together, and they never\r\nstopped believing in me, their Trainer.\c\nYou and your Pokémon are stronger...\nI can tell just by looking at you.\c\nBut I will not lose. No...\nI’m going to win!
You’re very cautious, aren’t you?
It was so strong! I could feel how powerful\nthe bond between you and your partners is.\r\nLosing is frustrating, but...\c\nYou will definitely be able to Mega Evolve\nyour Pokémon! I’m sure of it!
How about it?
I will master Mega Evolution and set\nmyself apart from other Trainers.\c\nI’ll also do it for my Pokémon--we’ve\ncome so far together, and they never\r\nstopped believing in me, their Trainer.\c\nYou and your Pokémon are stronger...\nI can tell just by looking at you.\c\nBut I’m not going to lose.\nThe winner of this battle will be me!
OK. Got it.
Your bonds with your Pokémon are\nreally strong.\r\nI don’t like losing much, but...\c\nI’m sure you’ll be able to\nMega Evolve your Pokémon!
There may be winners and losers\nin a Pokémon battle.\c\nBut I really thought you two\nand your Pokémon were all winners!
Mega Evolution is nothing more than just\none way to make Pokémon stronger.\c\nThere are many Trainers who bring\nout the strength of their Pokémon\r\nwithout Mega Evolution.
Well then, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\c\nFirst, you should challenge Korrina,\nthe Gym Leader.
Um, so what was the Intriguing Stone I, uh,\nI mean, [VAR TRNICK(0001)] found?
Oh yes, the Intriguing Stone!\nThank you for finding it!\c\nI thought it might have something to do\nwith Mega Evolution, but I was wrong.
Oh...\nThat so, huh...
Hm... You have a Venusaur with you, then.\c\nI’m excited to see what the two of you will\naccomplish with the power of Mega Evolution!
Hm... You have a Charizard with you, then.\c\nI’m excited to see what the two of you will\naccomplish with the power of Mega Evolution!
Hm... You have a Blastoise with you, then.\c\nI’m excited to see what the two of you will\naccomplish with the power of Mega Evolution!

Pokémon need a Mega Stone!\c\nAnd Pokémon Trainers\nneed the Mega Ring!
Well, my mysterious Trainer, my Lucario\nmay have taken a shine to you, but now\r\nI must test you to see if you’re ready to\r\nchallenge the Mega Evolution successor!\c\nI’ll be waiting for you at the Gym!\c\nOh, the rest of your friends should\ncome challenge me at the Gym, too!
I’ll bet the professor will be happy\nif you master Mega Evolution.\c\nThat’s one way you can\nshow mastery as a Trainer.
I’ll bet the professor will be happy\nif you master Mega Evolution.\c\nThat’s one way you can\nshow mastery as a Trainer.
Well, that’s what the professor\nwanted us to do, after all!\c\nHe said we should aim to be the best\nTrainers we can be and enjoy our journey!
Tierno.\c\nShall we work to be the best\nTrainers we can be, too?
All right then! Let’s aim for the top!
Hope to see you again soon, [VAR TRNICK(0001)]!\nSee ya, Shaunee!
[VAR TRNICK(0001)], I think that you and Serena are\ngoing to compete against each other and get\r\nreally strong!\c\nI’m so glad we’re all traveling together! ♪
[VAR TRNICK(0001)], I think you and Calem are\ngoing to compete against each other and get\r\nreally strong!\c\nI’m so glad we’re all traveling together! ♪
You don’t really need to go to all the trouble\nof comparing--every living creature is unique.\c\nBut still, having someone to compete against and\naim for greater heights with is a very fine thing.
Oh!\nThat’s the Intriguing Stone!\c\nYou found it, did you?\nThank you! That’s a big help!
I guess Korrina wants to see\nhow good a Trainer you are first.
Other items related to Mega Evolution,\nlike the Mega Ring or Mega Stones,\r\nmust still remain hidden in the vast Kalos region...\c\nMaybe I’ll search for them some more, so\nI can help strengthen the bonds between\r\nPokémon and their Trainers.
Only those who have been approved\nmay climb the Tower of Mastery!

Let’s trade one of your Sitrus Berries\nfor one of my Leppa Berries, shall we?
Thank you! You’re a wonderful\nPokémon Trainer!
I wish I could fly to the Berry field\nusing the move Fly.
You know what? My one and only\npsychic power tells me you\r\ndon’t have any Sitrus Berries.
I understand...\nIn this weather, I don’t blame you.
Gave a Sitrus Berry in exchange\nfor a Leppa Berry!
What? You have too many Leppa Berries!\c\nEven with my psychic power,\nI couldn’t predict that!
Friendship is power!\c\nWith that in mind, the best way to bring\nout a Pokémon’s hidden power is to\r\nbecome friends with it. Don’t you agree?
Mshoo.

I was invited out the other day by a friend\nwho recently joined up with Team Flare.\c\nHe just kept going on about how only\nTeam Flare had a future to look forward to...
Team Flare, huh? They stashed tons of\ncash and food and stuff in their secret HQ.\c\nThat’s what my friend who joined up\nwith Team Flare told me, anyhow...
There exists an item that can\nchange a Pokémon’s Ability!\c\nWell, that’s what I heard, but\nwhere do I actually find one?
Oh, what’s that you have there?\nThat’s a Kalos Pokédex, isn’t it?\c\nLet me have a look for a moment.\nIn Coastal Kalos you’ve seen...\r\n[VAR NUM3(0000)] Pokémon!\c\nLet me know when you hit 40.\nI’ll prepare a little treat for you.

An Eviolite is quite a handy item.\nWould you believe what it does?\c\nIt raises the Defense and Special\nDefense for a Pokémon holding it.\c\nBut I’m afraid there is one catch.\nIt only works for Pokémon that\r\ncan evolve, but haven’t finished\r\nevolving. Mysterious, isn’t it?

Oh...?\c\nOh my!\c\nYour [VAR PKNAME(0000)] seems to like you!\c\nThat’s so nice to see. Makes me want\nto give you this!
If a Pokémon holds a Soothe Bell, it will\nbecome more friendly to you.

Oh!\n[VAR iCOLOR3(0000)][VAR PKNAME(0000)] type is with you!\c\nWould you help me get some luggage\nthat’s too high for me to reach?
Thank you!\nI’ll give you this!
Having Pokémon with you\ncan be a big help sometimes, eh?
That’s too bad.\c\nI need a Flying- or Psychic-type\nPokémon to help me out.
If you are a Trainer, will you show me\nhow you’re raising your Pokémon\r\nwith loving care?
Oh! You’re a shy Trainer.
Which Pokémon will you show me?
...Hmmm.\nIt’s hard to tell...
Well...it’s a bit hard to tell\nhow much that Egg has grown.
Oh! This [VAR PKNAME(0001)] was level [VAR NUM3(0002)]\nwhen you met, but now it’s level [VAR NUM3(0003)]!
Wow! This is surprising!\nYou trained the Pokémon this much.\c\nYou’ve raised it very well.\nIt’s received a lot of love from you.
You’ve raised it quite well.\nI feel your love for this Pokémon.
You’ve raised it well.\nI can feel a bit of love from you.
What? It has not grown at all.\c\nStill, if you travel with your Pokémon\nfrom now on, I’m sure it will grow!
You walk to raise your Pokémon!\nThis is a token of gratitude for showing\r\nme your great love for your Pokémon!
[VAR TRNAME(0000)] received a Footprint Ribbon!
[VAR TRNAME(0000)] put the Footprint Ribbon\non [VAR PKNAME(0001)]!
This fantastic Footprint Ribbon shows\nthe love you’ve given to [VAR PKNAME(0001)].
The number of footprints\nshows the amount of your love...\c\nThank you for showing me the wonderful\nbond between you and your Pokémon.

A shining stone that emitted great warmth\nwas discovered...\c\nAnd then a great tower was built to house and\nprotect the stone.

They’re very rare, but here in the Kalos region,\nyou can find mysterious stones that are filled\r\nwith life energy!

Oh! I have been defeated! Alack, alay!\nLady Korrina gave a terrible display!\c\nThis is it. I must give up my title and\nadmit that your strength far exceeds--\c\nJust teasing! But here’s your Badge.\nBoy, you’ll be rolling in ’em soon!
[VAR TRNAME(0000)] received the\nRumble Badge from Korrina!
If you’ve got a Rumble Badge, then\nyou can trade Pokémon up to Lv. 50\r\nwith your friends and they’ll be ready\r\nto roll! They’ll love you, all right!\c\nAnd you’ll be able to roll over waves\nusing the HM Surf, even outside battle!\c\nAnd here, why don’t you take this TM?\nI’ve really been on a roll with it myself!
Power-Up Punch does just what it says\non the box!\c\nThe more that you use it, the tougher your\nfists get.\c\nKeep using it.\nYour Attack will go through the roof!
Look... I do have to apologize.\c\nYou’ll have to make it up to the top of the\nTower of Mastery if you want the Mega Ring.\c\nI’m sorry for sending you this way and that.\nI swear, I’m not giving you the runaround!\c\nYou’ve done great rolling with the punches.\nSo great that I’d like to ask you a favor...\c\nBattle me again, won’t you? But this time,\nit won’t be just another Gym Battle...\c\nI want a battle between equals! As two\nTrainers who can use Mega Evolution!

Hey, [VAR TRNICK(0000)]!\nHow’s your journey going?
Hello, [VAR TRNAME(0001)]!\c\nLet’s compare our Coastal Kalos Pokédexes\nand see who has seen more kinds of Pokémon!\c\nTo put it another way, I’m challenging you to\nmy own kind of Pokémon battle.
So, you’ve seen [VAR NUM3(0002)]\nkind[VAR NUMBRNCH(0002,0100)]s of Pokémon...\c\nI lost.\nHow frustrating!
So, you’ve seen [VAR NUM3(0002)] kinds of Pokémon...\c\nI’ve seen 39, so I guess I win!
We’ve both seen 39 kinds of Pokémon.\c\nWell, I may not have won, but I didn’t lose either.\nIn other words, it’s a tie!
Oh! So, you’ve seen Kangaskhan,\ntoo, [VAR TRNICK(0000)]?\c\nJust knowing about the same Pokémon as\nsomeone else can sure make you happy!
Get this! I’ve found some great Pokémon dancers!
Oh yes, I just remembered. The professor told\nus to say hello to the Mega Evolution guru\r\nwhen we reached Shalour City...
That’s right! He did say that!
Ummm...\nWho were we supposed to say hello to again?
A person called the Mega Evolution guru.
Oh, that’s right! He did say that!
Well, I guess we should look for\nthe Mega Evolution guru, then!
Where do you think he is anyway?
I heard he’s in that imposing building\ndeep in the city--the Tower of Mastery.
There sure are lots of different\nPokémon in Trevs’s Pokédex.
Maybe it would be best if we went\nto the Tower of Mastery now.
[VAR TRNICK(0000)], check this out!
A new dance?
Check what out?
Isn’t this stone cool?\c\nI got it from this person called the wandering\nstone collector for showing off my dance moves!\c\nIt might be a Mega Stone!\c\nHere, [VAR TRNICK(0000)], you can have it!
I want you to have it, ’cause you’re such\na great Trainer and all...\c\nI still remember our battle on Route 5.
That’s the Tower of Mastery?\nSooo cool!
Well, I’ll go call Trevs, then.\c\nGo on ahead, OK?
Here, neighbor.\nYou should use this.
If you use the HM Surf,\nyou can travel over the water.
When I think about it, it’s kind of amazing\nhow a person like you came to Kalos\r\nand ended up traveling with me.\c\nIt’s like destiny in a way.
Here, take this.
If you use the HM Surf, you\ncan travel over the water.
I’ll challenge you to battle again sometime.\nThat’s the best way to get strong, after all.\c\nI was lucky enough to meet you and end\nup traveling together, so I’d better take\r\nadvantage of the opportunity to battle.
[~ 30]
I’m really sorry, but I’m looking for something.
I just can’t seem to find it...\nIt’s such an intriguing stone, too...\c\nHey, could that be it?\nIs that the stone I’m looking for?
What luck! Here, I’ll give you\nthis Sun Stone for it!\c\nIt’s a mysterious stone that makes\ncertain Pokémon evolve.
[VAR TRNAME(0000)] handed over\nthe Intriguing Stone.
It’s a funny thing. You tend to come\nacross rare stones in Shalour City.\c\nI’ll bet the Mega Evolution guru’ll be\nreally happy if this is a Mega Stone.
Hm... A team like you and [VAR PKNAME(0000)]\ncan accomplish anything!\c\nI think in this town anyway...\nI haven’t really been anywhere else.
When you act like Pokémon exist only to battle,\nthen winning or losing becomes the only thing that\r\nmatters. That can make everything a lot less fun.
Traditionally Pokémon battles were\na ritual that people and Pokémon used\r\nto learn about and accept one another.
So, I know this Hiker who really likes Ferris\nwheels. It looks like he finally found love...
There sure are a lot of different items\nto make Pokémon’s power bloom in full!
A Mega Stone is kind of like a\ngood-luck charm for Pokémon.
Smooth, flat stones reflect\nlight consistently, so you\r\ncan see reflections in them.
The Leader, Korrina, is in the Tower of Mastery\ndoing some intensive training.
I want to be more awesome than I am now!\nI know Trainers and Pokémon both feel that way!
Know how your hair sticks out all\nover the place when you wake up?\r\nThink Mega Evolution is like that?
Shalour City\nA city of awakening.
Trainer Tips!\c\nIn Super Training, you can make your Pokémon\nstrong by having them play sports in virtual space!

Very impressive, actually!\c\nI have a feeling that our battle will turn out\nto be worth the wait!\c\nI hope you’ll show me that your skill as\na Trainer surpasses even mine.
There are some things that seem out of reach\nno matter how hard you try.\c\nHowever, it’s important that you never give up--\nno matter the opponent or the odds.\c\nI could tell from our battle that you and your\nPokémon understand that.\c\nTo commemorate such an impressive show of\nteamwork, please accept the Cliff Badge!
[VAR TRNAME(0000)] received the\nCliff Badge from Grant!
With the Cliff Badge in your grasp,\nyou should have no issues working\r\ntogether with Pokémon up to level 40.\c\nThis even applies to Pokémon you’ve\nreceived from other people in trade.\c\nAnd that’s not all. You also get...this!
It’s Rock Tomb.\c\nWith this move, a Pokémon can hurl rocks at its\ntarget, not only inflicting damage but also lowering\r\nthe target’s Speed and preventing it from moving.
Now that you’ve become a master wall climber\nand conquered this Gym, it’s time you thought\r\nabout how to apply your skills in other areas!\c\nThink about how you can improve yourself, as\nwell as the Pokémon that are always by your side.\c\nWhen you find the answer, that’s when you’ll\ntruly be able to smile!
Have you heard of the Battle Chateau on Route 7?\c\nI like to take the occasional trip there.\c\nIf it pleases you, I hope you might honor me with\na rematch there someday.
Hey, hey, it’s the future Champ!\nWhat’s goin’ down?
This is the Rock-type Pokémon Gym, but\nyou already figured that out, am I right?\c\nRock types are great, aren’t they? Weak\nto Steel, Water, and all kinds of things!\c\nNow check out that wall. You can climb\nit if you start from one of those blue spots.\c\nLeft, right, up, down--you’ll need to climb\nevery which way to reach the Gym Leader!

Oh dear... If you’re here for the Bicycle\nrace, I’m afraid you’re too late.\c\nThe race is over, and I took first place.
I feel bad that you missed it. Here--allow me\nto give you this Strength HM in consolation.\c\nIf one of your Pokémon uses the move,\nit will be able to push large rocks around.
However, if you want to use the move outside\nof battle, you’ll first need a Badge from\r\nthe Gym I run in this city.\c\nOn that note, I’ll be waiting for you in the Gym.\nCome challenge me at your leisure.
Whether on the back of a Pokémon or on\na Bicycle, I just love riding!
No luck fishing? Try another spot!\nMove not very effective? Try another one!\c\nWhen things don’t go well, it’s always\na good idea to try something else.
In a Bicycle race, I have to work with my\nteammates to seize victory.\c\nIt’s a bit like the relationship\nbetween a Trainer and a Pokémon.
Sometimes I like to hop on my Bicycle and go for\na ride just to get some exercise!\c\nIn a Pokémon battle, it’s the Pokémon doing all the\nwork, so it’s important for a Trainer to move, too!
I always think very carefully about which Poké Ball\nI use when trying to catch a new Pokémon!
It’s always so hard for me to decide what items\nto give to my Pokémon...\c\nDo I give them something to boost their\nstrong points or something that covers\r\nfor their weak points?
I’m gonna get better and stronger and then\nclimb the Tower of Mastery in Shalour City!\c\nFirst things first--I’m off to defeat Grant,\nthe Gym Leader of this city!
You’ll find the Gym Leader in this city\nat the top of that hill over there!\c\nI may have lost to him in the Bicycle race,\nbut I’ll get my revenge in a Pokémon battle!
I love being connected with the Holo Caster.\nIt feels good to always be up to date on the\r\nlatest and greatest news.
Hello there!\c\nCould I tempt you with some super-refreshing\nSoda Pop? Only $300 a bottle! How about it?

Trainer Tips!\c\nTo teach a Pokémon a move from a TM,\nopen your Bag and go to the TMs & HMs Pocket.\c\nFrom there, choose the TM that contains the\nmove you want to teach to your Pokémon.\c\nOnce you’ve done that, you’ll be able to\nselect a Pokémon that can learn the move.\c\nAll that’s left is to confirm your selection,\nand your Pokémon will learn the move!
What secret do the stones contain?\nWhy are they able to absorb energy?
Just what kind of technology did they have\n3,000 years ago?
I still don’t have any regrets about\njoining Team Flare!

Sigh... My cooking is only half decent...\nAnd my Pokémon are only half decent...
The training at my place, Restaurant\nLe Wow, is tougher than anything...
Even though I’m only half decent,\nI’m still training my tail off every day.\r\nAren’t you curious to see my skill?
Then I’ll let you get a\ntaste of my cooking!
Oh? So the training at Restaurant\nLe Wow even scares Trainers away.

I couldn’t agree more.\nThis will be a fateful battle.
I suppose it’s also important\nto consider where you battle.
When I battle, I like to imagine\nthat I’m in a scene in a movie.\c\nDo come be my costar again.

This is where I met him for the first time...\nAnd where he disappeared from my life...
When I saw him there, unmoving,\nI fell head over heels...
My love disappeared into the dark shadows\nof the alleys. Do you understand that pain?
Then help me forget my pain.\nBe so strong that it hurts.
He just disappeared...\nAnd now so will you...
Yes, the one I fell in love with\nwas the man in the poster...\c\nBut the wind and the rain, they\nravaged his beautiful face...\c\nUntil one day they had stolen\nhim away and he was gone...
Do what you like with that...\c\nI will come here again, in search\nof any hint of my darling’s fate...

Hey! Hey! What do you think you’re doing in a\nplace like this, huh?
What? You’re still here?
These alleys are heavy with the scent of danger...\nStill sure you don’t want to leave?
I guess words just won’t get through to you.\nThen maybe a battle will!
I’m waitin’ here for a real important\nbusiness meetin’, so get lost already!
Are ya somebody’s hired muscle?\nThat strength just ain’t normal...
Won’t you just buzz off?
Leave me alone, wouldja?
What is this, a macho contest?\nIf I fight you, will you go away?
Fine... Let’s just get this over with.
Then, get lost.
Normally, I ought to leave, too.\nJust leave me alone next time.
Lumiose City is so glamorous!\nI’m so glad I left the country!
What do you think it’s like, living a glamorous life?
Being able to battle in the middle of a\ngreat city is quite glamorous, right?
Glad to hear it! Then let’s get glammed up!
Ohhh, it was so cool the way you said no like that.\nI guess that’s pretty glam.
So, what did you think?\nWas I pretty glamorous?
Here! A little gift for being so glam.\c\nLet’s meet again and have a glamorous time,\nshall we? Then au revoir for now!

A parallel swizzle is a very cool technique\nin which you swing your body left and right\r\nand skate as if you were dancing.\c\nSlowly move the Circle Pad in the\ndirection you’re traveling.
There are other cool skaters in Lumiose.\c\nTalk to them, and you’ll enjoy roller skating\neven more!
I’m trading Pokémon by\nLink Trade now.
A Pokémon has arrived!\nWow! It’s even holding an item!

If you want the hottest street fashions,\nthis is the place for you!\c\nIt has the perfect lineup for the type of guy\nwho seems like he could tear up the road\r\nif you invited him to go roller skating.
If you’re looking for classy items,\nthis is the place for you!\c\nThey have well-designed shirts,\njackets, and pants there.\c\nI recommend the fedora as well--it\ncan really make you look mature.
If you’re looking for upscale, casual items,\nthis is the place for you!\c\nThey have a good selection of simple\nclothes that work with any outfit.
If you have to have it all and be both\npretty and cute, this is the place for you!\c\nThey have ruffled camisoles, skirts,\nsparkly dresses, and colorful shorts.\c\nThis boutique’s selling point\nis its rich lineup of clothes.
If you’re aiming for elegance,\nthis is the place for you!\c\nThey have clothes with designs\nthat just radiate classiness,\r\nsuch as trench coats, hats,\r\nblouses with ties, and shirts.\c\nThis is the lineup for you if you’re looking\nto take your fashion to the next level.

If you’re looking for clothes that bring out\nthe charms of a grown woman, this is the place.\c\nThey have tops with scarves, dresses with the\nalways-fashionable color black in them,\r\nsleeveless turtlenecks, and so much more.\c\nThe refined colors and design\nhave a subtle elegance.\c\nThat’s the kind of lineup they have.
You can be fashionable no matter\nwhat type of body you have.\c\nSo I enjoy both fashion and food!
I always want to wear the same things\nas my Pokémon.\c\nSo I have several of the same outfit.
Chi-chi-chiirp!
So, fashion is all about\nhow well you understand yourself.\c\nSo, that’s the reason I’m\nwearing shorts as well.
Recently, I’ve been paying more attention to\nthings such as accent colors and the balance\r\nbetween the top half and bottom half of my outfits.\c\nIf the top half of my outfit is black and the bottom\nhalf is gray, I should try wearing red shoes, right?\r\nOr I could carry a colorful bag to give it a spark!
Don’t ever doubt yourself because of what\npeople say or because of the times!

Our customers just love to take photos\nand to have their photos taken, as well.\c\nThey have a wonderful time at our café,\nshooting the breeze about their shots!
So which do you like\nbest: long or short?
Long
Short
What?
Yeah, you really do need\nsome decent length, right?
You think short’s good?\nYou have some taste.
Focal length, of course! The distance\nbetween the lens and image sensor!\r\nIt decides when a subject is in focus!\c\nThe longer the focal length, the better\nfor zooming in on something far away.\c\nBut a short focal length will allow you\nto capture a whole wide area clearly.
I’m not very good at photography,\nbut I love getting my photo taken!
When a professional photog like me\nlooks at you, I think...\c\n“You’ve never even picked up a\ncamera, have you?” Am I right?\c\nGet it together! Go check out one\nof the photo spots already!
When a professional photog like me\nlooks at you, I think...\c\n“Yeah, [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0100)]she's definitely been out\nthere taking some photographs.”\c\nI’ll give you this, then. You’ll be\nsure to really use it... Am I right?
When a professional photog like me\nlooks at you, I think...\c\n“Yeah, [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0100)]she's definitely been out\nthere taking some photographs.”\c\nBut there are photo-worthy spots\nyou haven’t shot. Yeah, I’m right.
When a professional photog like me\nlooks at you, I think...\c\n“Yeah, [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0100)]she's definitely been out\nin the field shooting up a storm!”\c\nI’ll give you this, then. You’ll be\nsure to really use it... Am I right?

When a professional photog like me\nlooks at you, I think...\c\n“Hey, [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0100)]she's taken this many shots already?”\nYour aura is blinding me!\c\nI’ll give you this, then. You’ll be\nsure to really use it... Am I right?
When a professional photog like me\nlooks at you, I think...\c\n“Man, [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0100)]she's taken this many shots already?”\nYour aura is blinding me!\c\nIt’s amazing. Too amazing! You’ve\ntotally gone beyond a pro like me.
I’m gonna make my own cameras\nsomeday--just you wait and see!\c\nIf you wanna know about cameras,\nI can answer all your questions!
Anything else you wanna know?
Taking pictures
The zoom function
Auto vs. manual
Achieving focus
About aperture
Adjusting brightness
I have it all down!
The R Button is your shutter release!\nPress it and you can take a picture.
Press right on your +Control Pad\nto zoom in. Press left to zoom out!
Auto mode is a simple mode\nwhere all you control is the\r\nzoom and the shutter release.\c\nIn Manual mode, you can fine-tune\nbrightness and aperture.\r\nIt’s the mode for expert photogs!\c\nJust press the A Button if you\nwant to flip between modes!
When you’ve framed your picture\nso it’s in focus, your subject will\r\nbe nice and clear. If your subject’s\r\nfuzzy, then it’s sure not in focus.\c\nIn Manual mode, you’ll adjust the\nfocus with the +Control Pad, so\r\nplay around to find the sweet spot!
Aperture is basically what controls\nthe balance between the sharp and\r\nthe fuzzy parts of your picture, OK?\c\nAperture can be controlled with the\nX Button in Manual mode. The higher\r\nit is, the clearer your picture will be.
In Manual mode, you can adjust how\nbright the scenery is with the Y Button.\c\nThe higher you set this brightness level,\nthe more light in the background. OK?
If you ever wanna hear more about\ncameras, come talk to me anytime!
Ah, photographs... They are the art\nof a moment, tearing away the thin\r\nwraps of time’s relentless march...\c\nWith each passing second, the present\ntransforms irrevocably into the past.\c\nWith my photographs, I will pin the\n“now” in place for all eternity...
Ah, photographs... They are the art\nthat captures the beauty of nature\r\nusing light and air as their media...\c\nCapturing the infinite possibility of\ncolor on a finite roll of artificial film...\c\nWith my photographs, I will express\nthe eloquence of nature’s brush...
Ah, photographs...\c\nThey are the art that can scrape away\nwhat is real and remake reality as pretense...\c\nPhotographs can create images that\nhold more realism than the real world.\c\nWith my photographs, I will sculpt a\nreal world of dreams and illusions...
Ah, photographs...\c\nThey are the art that we orchestrate using\nan instrument known as the “camera.”\c\nThis duet harmonizes the melody of life\nwith the rhythm of the machine.\c\nWith my photographs, I will sing\na joyous tribute to all humanity...

We’re enjoying the flavors and the atmosphere.\nAnd we’re looking good while we do it, too.
So we’re having a meal together as men.\nNothing wrong with that.
The most important thing in a Double Battle\nis the connection between two Pokémon.\r\nYes, just like the connection between him and me...
We eat here every day. After all,\nevery day is our anniversary!
Nah, nah, nah, nah! You just don’t get it!\nIt’s, like, totally averagely good!
Totally averagely good?\nIs that supposed to be a compliment?
You’ve got to eat every last crumb of food!\nIf you waste food, isn’t it way too “mottainai”?\r\nThat’s what we say where I’m from in Kanto!
May I offer you some water?\nOr does that just make you think “Nah”?
So what if we’ve just got one star?\nWe’ll just have to be the best one-star café, then!

Just what I’d expect of a three-star restaurant.\nEverything is refined and fit for its purpose.
This place serves an exclusive clientele.\c\nOf course, you would know that without my\nbothering to explain it. Is that not so?
Gobble! Snarfle! Snarf! Gulp!
My man eats like a Pokémon, doesn’t he?
A full five-course set of Double Battles,\nTriple Battles, and Rotation Battles!\c\nBoth the meals and the battles\nin this restaurant are served à la russe!
I missed my chance to taste the most\nexquisite food when it was ripe for the picking...
I’m s-so nervous being here\nthat I can’t even taste a thing...
Look at him, chewing so slowly and quietly...\c\nHis manners are very refined and proper.\nDo you think he might be a renowned food critic?
Are you perhaps looking for the restroom?
Of course, [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0403)]sirmiss.\nPlease allow me to show you the way.
If you ever are in need of the facilities,\nplease just say the word.
Will you be leaving, [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0403)]sirmiss?

“Slack” is related to words like “lax” and\n“languish.” Linguistics sure is fun, huh?\c\nJust a little trivia from a slacker like me!
A lot of people have been\npraising your bed-making skills.

Our cook likes to make everything like\nhe was trained at a sushi restaurant.\r\nHe’s definitely not a normal Chef...
Food has to be fresh!\nJust leave it up to me!
I’m cleaning a square\nroom ’round in circles!\c\nIn other words...\nI’m cuttin’ the corners!
Oh, won’t someone, somewhere...\ngive me a Lovely Kiss someday...
Ahhhhhhhhh!\c\nIt’s not broken!\nIt’s not!
We Waitresses have\nput together a band!
I use Belly Drum and Beat\nUp to inspire my drumwork.
We’re gonna use a Trainer PR Video\nto get the word out about our band!
Our signature move is\ndouble-team cleaning!
I just can’t seem to get this stain out!\nWe both have to take it on at once!
Mm-hmm! Look at the sheen on this vase!\nIt’s a pretty fine job, if I do say so myself.
Sometimes I like to imagine...\c\nWhat if all the guests in the hotel\nwere Furfrou instead of people?
Fouaf fouaf!
Ouaf-ouaf-fouaf!
Lovely how they don’t lock the doors\nhere at the Hotel Richissime, isn’t it?\r\nThis hotel feels so freeing somehow.

That’s the boulevard that surrounds\nthe south half of Lumiose City, OK?\c\nThe most popular shops on it are the\nPokémon Lab, the PR Video Studio,\r\nand the salon, Coiffure Clips.\c\nYou can reach Route 4 or Route 5\nfrom there. Or as we locals call ’em...\r\nParterre Way and Versant Road!
That’s the boulevard that runs around the\nnorthern half of Lumiose City, of course.\c\nThe popular destinations on North are the\nBattle Institute, Hotel Richissime, and...\r\nOh, Lumiose Station, to hop on the TMV!\c\nIf you want to reach Route 13, 14, or 16,\nyou can get there from here.\c\nBut, of course, we locals all know them as\nLumiose Badlands, Laverre Nature Trail,\r\nand Mélancolie Path!
Vernal Avenue is on the south of Lumiose\nCity, and it’s packed with specialty shops.\c\nIn Boutique Couture, for example, you can get\nitems that are unique to Lumiose City.\c\nFriseur Furfrou is the only place that most\npeople will trust with grooming their Furfrou.\c\nThere’s also the Herboriste and a ton of\nlittle cafés.
Estival Avenue is an avenue on the south side\nof Lumiose City with a relaxing atmosphere.\c\nYou can find popular spots like the Loto-ID\nCenter, where people say you can win big,\r\nand a café where roller-skating enthusiasts\r\ngather. And most important of all...\c\nThis company right here! You should already\nknow that, though, since you came in today!
Autumnal Avenue is on the north side of\nLumiose City and has a few special shops.\c\nSome are really big with the tourists, like\nthe Poké Ball Boutique, where they only\r\nsell Poké Balls--every kind under the sun.\c\nThen there’s a shop that specializes in juice,\nthe Juice Shoppe, which Pokémon all love.\c\nAnd Restaurant Le Yeah serves decent food.
Hibernal Avenue is one of the avenues up\non the northern side of Lumiose City.\c\nIt’s famous for its three-star restaurant,\nRestaurant Le Wow, which is THE place\r\nto be. All the VIPs in Kalos are seen there.
Centrico Plaza stretches out around the\nsymbol of Lumiose City, Prism Tower.\c\nVernal, Estival, Autumnal, and Hibernal:\nall four major avenues connect there, at\r\nthe center and the heart of the entire city.\c\nPhil the Photo Guy is probably a big draw, too.

The secret of the power

On the XXth day of the XXth month\nat the Pokémon Day Care on Route 7\c\nAbout the extraordinary power that Volcanion is\nsaid to possess.\c\nDiscussed it with a top Breeder who’s very familiar\nwith the ecology of Pokémon and drew the\r\nfollowing deduction.\c\nIn order to cause a steam explosion powerful\nenough to blow up mountains, the Pokémon must\r\nhave an organ with extremely high temperature\r\nthat can instantly vaporize water to steam.\c\nThat kind of organ is unheard of in the ecology\nof Pokémon, but Volcanion may have it...
On the XXth day of the XXth month\nat the Pokémon Center in Camphrier Town\c\nInterviewed a Trainer who says he witnessed a\nPokémon that could be Volcanion when he was\r\nstranded in a mountain.\c\nAccording to the Trainer, a huge Pokémon’s\nshadow appeared suddenly.\c\nTwo huge armlike limbs that could crush even\nthe land extended from its back, and from their tips,\r\nsomething that looked like smoke belched out and\r\nmade the fog around the Pokémon even thicker.\c\nThe Trainer said the Pokémon’s shadow\nslowly disappeared into the fog.
On the XXth day of the XXth month\nat Café Kizuna in Lumiose City\c\nIn the southern part of the Kalos region,\nthere seems to be a custom to revere\r\nVolcanion as a nation-building Pokémon.\c\nPeople seem to believe that a steam explosion\ncaused by Volcanion created the plain\r\nwhere they live.\c\nAs a matter of fact, a huge mountain range\nsuddenly disappeared due to an unexplained\r\nexplosion in that part of the region in the past...
If you feel like reading my memo,\ncome visit me anytime.
Volcanion seems to trust you.
I want you and Volcanion to travel together\nas good partners to each other!
Is there another part of the memo\nyou’re interested in reading?
My top-secret memo about Volcanion...\c\nIf you’re Volcanion’s Trainer,\nI wouldn’t mind you reading it.

If you want to give your Pokémon a treat,\nit should at least be a Deluxe Poké Puff!
When my sweet Pokémon smiles at me,\nI can’t help but smile back!\c\nAnd do you know what happens then?\nIt makes my Pokémon, like, super happy!\c\nAnd what happens after that is...\nI get, like, unbelievably happy, too!
Myaow myaow?
The more that you play with your Pokémon,\nthe more likely they’ll show you new moves!\c\nBeing able to really feel and see that they like you\nmore and more--what could make you happier?
Sigh... You know, my Pokémon...\nEven when I pet it, it doesn’t react much...\c\nSigh... I guess it’s true what they say...\nPokémon do take after their Trainers...
Oooh! If you want a sweet and cute Pokémon,\nthen you’ve gotta have an unevolved Pokémon!\c\nI just can’t get enough of the eager and\nenergetic nature of an unevolved Pokémon!
Ahhh! If you want a Pokémon you can stroke\nand caress, it’s gotta be an evolved Pokémon!\c\nI just can’t get enough of the cool, mature\nattitude of an evolved Pokémon!
Pmmpha!
Have you ever poked a Pikachu’s cheek?
It’s TOTALLY shocking, right?!
It’ll TOTALLY shock you!
I thought I was the one who was taking care of my\nPokémon, but maybe I’m the one being cared for.

A round thing is wonderful, isn’t it?\c\nBecause it goes on and on, and it has no end.\c\nDo you like round things, too?
Yes
No
I thought so.\c\nFrom any angle, a round thing is round,\nsuch as the Pokémon Voltorb.\r\nThus, it has ultimate beauty.\c\nI’ll give you this as a present.
You’re very square.
A round ball rolls in any direction...
I wonder if comfort levels are different\ndepending on the kind of Poké Ball.
If we fail to catch a Pokémon\nwith a Poké Ball, we can’t use\r\nthat Poké Ball again...
Just as I enjoy wearing different fashions,\nPokémon must wish they could experience\r\njumping into different Poké Balls!
Hmmeo!

This café was set up by Furfrou admirers for\nFurfrou admirers and their beloved Furfrou!
I’ve never spent more than 218 seconds\naway from this precious pooch of mine\r\nsince it came into this world!\c\nIt is a part of me, and I am a part of it.
What’s with that expression?\c\nYou look mighty confident in how long your\nFurfrou has maintained its terrific trim.
Of course I am!
Not particularly...
Ohhh! You cheeky little thing!\c\nFine! Then I’ll take it upon myself\nto judge how good you really are!
Gasp!\c\nWhat are you?!\nSome sort of pro?!\c\n...Fine. Take this.
Sniff! As I thought, you’re nothing special.\c\nIf you want to make me gasp in shock,\nlet’s see you keep that trim for [VAR NUM1(0000)] day[VAR NUMBRNCH(0000,0100)]s!
Maintaining a perfect Furfrou trim...\nThat is the only true reflection of your\r\nlove toward your Furfrou in my book!
Hmph. How terribly disappointing.\nThis is all terribly, terribly disappointing.
Feel it! Feel the Furfrou admiration gathering\nhere from all across the Kalos region...\r\nWe are Furfrou admirers! In short, Furfroumers!
That’s right! I keep my precious Furfrou\ntrimmed in the prized Pharaoh style!\r\nIt shows that I’m a prized customer!
You know, when I leave home every morning,\nI kiss every one of my 101 Furfrou good-bye.
...What? You want to know why I’m here?\c\nPretty much to see how the other half lives!\nYou can just taste the bourgeoisie in the air!
Whine...
I like natural Furfrou the best.

We train our bodies and spirits\nto love Pokémon more deeply!\c\nThis is Café Ultimo, the favorite\nwatering hole for S.T. fanatics!
Can you believe how Pokémon can get\nstronger from training in a virtual space?\r\nS.T. sure is one amazing toy, all right!\c\nThat Clemont is a genius for making it!
It’s not just for Pokémon!\nI’m training myself, too!
What?! You pressed the L Button,\nand your Pokémon put up a barrier?!
What?! You mean there’s an opening\nafter you use a barrier once?\c\nYou can’t just throw up another barrier\nright away after the last one?!
What?! Different Pokémon can use\nbarriers for different amounts of time?!
Whoa! You can get closer to the opponent\nby pressing up on the +Control Pad?!\r\nAnd pressing down moves you farther away?!
Whoa! So, if you are closer to the\nopponent, you can hit it more easily,\r\nbut it’s harder to dodge incoming shots?!
Whoa! If you keep your stylus pressed\nto the screen after shooting, your\r\nPokémon will store up its energy...\c\nAre you serious?! Then it lets off an\neven stronger shot when you let go?!
Whoa! If you store up too much\nenergy, your shot might fail?!\r\nTiming is, like, vital and stuff?!
Hiya! D’ya want me to read you a really\nlong and difficult book? Do ya? Do ya?
All righty! Here I go, so listen up!\n“Super Training and Physical Fitness”\c\n“The researchers began the study with\ntwo test subjects. Each of these two\r\nRattata were selected to be identical in\r\nlevel, parameters, and inherent Nature.”\c\n“One of the two subjects was allowed\nto play in the S.T. environment, in an\r\neffort to test the hypothesis that it is\r\npossible to raise an isolated base stat\r\nin a controlled environment.”\c\n“After a week under these conditions,\nthe two Rattata were examined again\r\nand their parameters were remeasured.”\c\n“As a result, the researchers found that\nthe Rattata that underwent Super Training\r\ndemonstrated statistically significant\r\nimprovement in both the strength and\r\nspeed of its moves when compared to\r\nthe Rattata that was not treated with\r\nthe S.T. Regimen during the study.”\c\nOK! All done! What did you think?
Whaaat?! Even though I can read\nsuch a long and difficult book?!
Hey there, stranger...\nHow about a little chat?
[~ 14]
What a wet blanket...
Something exciting
Something gloomy
Something cheerful
I have to go
Hey, hey, would you just listen to this?\nYou won’t believe the day I’ve had...\c\nSo...my little Machoke was beating the\nstuffing out of its training bag, right?\c\nAnd then outta nowhere--nowhere at\nall!--this other training bag appears!\c\nAnd now, my Machoke’s gonna have to\nhit that one, too, right? Or it’ll never be\r\nsatisfied, and I’ll never hear the end of it!\c\n...Arrrggghhh, why does little Machoke\nalways have to find more training bags?
Hey, hey, would you just listen to this?\nYou won’t believe the day I’ve had...\c\nSo, I decided to slack off my Machoke’s\ntraining for a bit. Went to an all-you-can-\r\neat buffet, right? Nothing wrong there.\c\nThen what happens but I come back\nto find my little Machoke snoring away!\c\nBut you’ve gotta let it slide, right? You\ngotta, or you’ll never hear the end of it.\c\n...You let it slide and just tap ’em, right?\nThen they’ll wake up all raring to go.
Hey, hey, would you just listen to this?\nYou won’t believe the day I’ve had...\c\nSo my little Machoke is all, like, super\npumped up for its training today, right?\c\nWhen it’s pumped up like this, it’ll go\nthrough training bags like water, right?\c\nYou gotta use chances like this, right?\nOr you’ll just never hear the end of it.\c\n...Ahhh, would you look at that? My\nlittle Machoke went back to normal.
Mumble mumble mumble...\c\nThis bag’ll raise a base stat just\na little, but it’ll do it in no time...\c\nThis bag’ll raise the same base stat a\nwhole heap, but it’ll take ages...
Mumble mumble mumble...\c\nMaybe I’ll use a training bag to up my\nPokémon’s parameters when I can’t win...
Mumble mumble mumble...\c\nSo, the shots you can use in the Super-\nTraining Regimens vary by Pokémon, huh?
Your Pokémon are looking a little\nsoft around the edges, hmm?\c\nBattling wild Pokémon and other\nTrainers is all well and good, kid,\r\nbut it just can’t compare to S.T.!
Your Pokémon are looking\npretty well cut, aren’t they?\c\nEspecially that [VAR PKNAME(0000)]...\nIt looks pretty ripped, all right!
Y-your [VAR PKNAME(0000)]!\c\nHow do you even GET a\nPokémon that muscular?!\c\nP-please, won’t you put\nthis [VAR RIBBON(0001)]\r\non your [VAR PKNAME(0000)]’s\r\nmuscles for me?
Mm-hmm. Those are some fine-\nlooking Pokémon, I daresay.\c\nEspecially that [VAR PKNAME(0000)] of yours.\nSo big, so brawny, so bulky!\r\nI can never get too much of it.

I’ll sell you this [VAR ITEM2(0001)] for just\n$[VAR NUM7(0003,002C)]. So what do you say?
I knew it! I knew just by looking\nthat you’d have impeccable taste!\c\nOh, indeed! Use it to the fullest!
Now don’t misunderstand--my desire to sell\nmy wares has not changed in the slightest!
This is one of the special power stones that I\nsqueeze and jiggle and warm in my own hands!\c\nI bet it makes them even more powerful, don’t\nyou think? Clink, clinkity-clink! Indeed, it does!
Perhaps my eyes are getting bad, but it looks\nas though you don’t have the coins for it.
My husband has dabbled in all lines of work,\nbut he never stuck with anything for very long.\c\nBut now that he’s found he can make a profit\njust from his knack for finding stones...\c\nWell, he’s become like a Shiny Stone in my eyes!
Look! It’s not a Metapod anymore, Dad!
When I gave my Jigglypuff a Moon Stone,\nit evolved into the Wigglytuff I have now.\c\nIt was totally sick, dude. Y’know?

Oh, it’s Lysandre and...\nIs that Diantha?\c\nSo get this, neighbor, Lysandre is the\nhead of Lysandre Labs, which created\r\nthe Holo Caster, a video-messaging device.\c\nYou already know about Diantha, right?\nShe is one of the most famous movie stars\r\nin the world, after all.\c\nI wonder what the two of them\nare doing here together.
You played a young girl so wonderfully\nin your debut on the silver screen.\c\nWouldn’t you rather remain young and\nbeautiful forever and always play such roles?
What a strange question...\c\nWhy would I want to play the\nsame old roles forever?\c\nYouth may be beautiful, but\nit’s not all there is to life.\c\nEverything changes. I want to\nlive and change like that, too.\c\nSo I look forward to playing\ndifferent roles as I get older.
You were chosen to be a movie star, correct?\nIsn’t it your duty to be ever beautiful?
Everything beautiful should stay that\nway forever.\c\nI would make this world unchanging and\neternal so all beauty will last forever.\c\nI can’t stand the thought of the world\nbecoming uglier.

Oh. Hello, [VAR TRNICK(0000)].

My name is Serena,\nand this is...
I’m Calem.\c\nIt’s a pleasure.\c\nThis is...
[VAR TRNAME(0000)], right?\c\nI heard Lysandre call you that.\nYou both have lovely names.\c\nOh, and you’re both Trainers!\nDon’t your Pokémon look happy?
I’m a Trainer myself, in my off time.\nI look forward to us battling someday!
Hmm...\c\nI guess if you’re a Pokémon Trainer, you\nbattle everyone, no matter who they are.
Oh, that’s right!\nI have something to ask you, neighbor.
Would you be willing to compete with me\nto see which of us will become stronger?\c\nI know we set off on our journey\njust after you arrived in Vaniville...\c\nBut we are neighbors, and I think it\nwould be fun to have a competition with you.\c\nJust so you know, I won’t lose though.
Hmm...\c\nI guess Pokémon Trainers all battle\neach other, no matter who they are.
Oh, yeah.\nI wanted to ask you something, neighbor.
How about you and I compete and\nsee who ends up stronger?\c\nI know we set off on our journey\njust after you arrived in Vaniville,\r\nbut we are neighbors, and having a\r\ncompetition with you sounds like fun.\c\nI won’t lose though. Just so you know.
I want to see Diantha’s movie!\nThe one where she travels with Pokémon!
I heard Lysandre’s gathering young people\nfor society’s sake.
If you’re like a cheerful sun,\neveryone will be grateful.\c\nIf you’re like the Pokémon Solrock...\nWell, some things are best left unsaid...
You know what? This café is the movie star\nDiantha’s favorite.\c\nI come here every day hoping to\nadmire Diantha...
The only thing that’s important about\nespresso is whether it’s delicious or not.

Oh, why hello there!\c\nThat’s right... This is the same café where\nI first met you, isn’t it, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]?

Heheh. We Trainers all feel a bit\nnervous when trading Pokémon...\c\nbut I’m sure it’s nothing compared\nto how the Pokémon must feel!
Hello, [VAR PKNAME(0002)]. I’m glad to meet you.\nWas it a bit shocking to be traded?\c\nI hope you’ll come to trust and like me.\nI promise that I’ll take good care of you.
No, of course I understand...\c\nI’m sure all of your Pokémon are\nlike precious friends to you, right?\c\nYou can’t just give away a friend\nto someone else that easily!
Thank you for trading with me!\c\nI’m sure we’ll both continue\nto become even better Trainers\r\nas we keep battling and growing!
Oh no, silly! You only have\none Pokémon with you now!\c\nYou can’t possibly trade away\nyour only Pokémon!\c\nBut I’d still like to trade with\nyou, so come back sometime!

Oh, I found an interesting café the other day!\c\nIt’s the café where Furfrou fans gather.\nThe name is Café Woof!\c\nThey’re more than fans.\nAll of them are Furfrou freaks.\c\nIt was amazing.
Since you’re changing your hairstyle,\nyou may want to drop by the PR Video Studio later!\c\nOnce you go there, you’ll be hooked!\nI’m hooked, too!
To tell you the truth, [VAR TRNAME(0000)],\nafter I recommended the studio to you,\r\nI had an urge to make a PR Video.\c\nIt’s been a while since I made\nmy last video, so I went there!\c\nI struck a lot of great\nposes with my Pokémon!\c\nI was able to create a unique\nPR Video. That was so much fun.
Lately, a strange man has\nbeen wandering around here.\c\nI can’t describe what’s\nstrange about him, but...\c\nHe said something I couldn’t understand,\n“Some power is something...something.”\c\nAnd then he suddenly\ndisappeared into thin air...
Oh!

Oh, do you know there’s a grooming\nsalon specifically for Furfrou?\c\nI’d like to take my Furfrou next time, but it seems\nthere are a lot of different grooming styles,\r\nand I can’t make up my mind\r\nwhat my Furfrou should look like.
I went to the grooming salon\nfor Furfrou yesterday!\c\nI thought and thought and finally\ndecided to go for the Heart Trim.\c\nIt looks so great!\nBut other cuts are also very charming...\c\nI hear that there are cuts only regular\ncustomers can choose.\c\nI’m so curious...\nWhen should I go again?

Oh, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].\nYour coordination is really cool!\r\nMy heart skipped a beat!
Oh, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].\nYour coordination suits you very well!\c\nYou wear everything very nicely.\nI envy you!
Sorry I’m totally changing the subject, but...\c\n[VAR TRNAME(0000)], I really like your\ncoordination today!\c\nI’m so curious about where I can buy those...\c\nWill you tell me the name of the boutique later?\c\nI’ll go to the shop with my husband\non my next day off!

Oh! The boutique you told me\nabout the other day...\c\nI went there! It was really nice, but\nI couldn’t decide what to buy.\c\nI found some great stuff for my husband,\nso I let him dress up for the first time in ages!
Oh! The boutique you told me about\nthe other day.\c\nI went there!\nIt was really nice.\c\nI was unable to decide what to buy.\c\nSince I couldn’t make up my mind,\nI just bought everything I saw!\r\nIt’s been ages since my last spree!
Wow! [VAR TRNAME(0001)].\nYou’ve caught [VAR PKNAME(0000)]!\c\nMy husband was murmuring...\c\n“Very, very Mythical.\nIt’s the king of Mythical Pokémon...”\c\nI knew it was a very rare Pokémon.\c\n[VAR TRNAME(0001)], as I expected,\nyou’re a great Trainer.

Oh, oh!\n[VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\c\nThe Champion!\nI heard that you won at the Pokémon League!\c\nI was there at your parade the other day!\nCongratulations!\c\nI’m so honored that my customer is the Champion!
Oh! I remember!\n[VAR TRNAME(0000)].\c\nToday is your birthday!\nHappy birthday!\c\nI’ll psych myself up\nand style your hair perfectly\r\nso that it will brighten up\r\nyour special day!
Just a hairstylist and a customer...\c\nIf you say so, I guess that’s what\nwe are, but I feel a strong connection\r\nwith you, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].\c\nIt’s a bit embarrassing to say\nthis now, but I appreciate\r\nthe connection with you!

Just tell me what you hope to achieve, and\nI’ll tell you the optimal herbal remedy!
Restore HP
Restore a lot of HP
Heal status conditions
Revive from fainting
Nothing really
Then this is what you need!\nEnergy Powder!\c\nYou’ll feel warmed from the inside out, and all\nyour exhaustion will just melt away!
Then this is what you need!\nAn Energy Root!\c\nIt’s bursting with nutrients and will make you\nexplode with energy! You’ll feel like a new person!
Then this is what you need!\nHeal Powder!\c\nIt will release all of the toxins in your system.\nIt’s phenomenal for detoxing!
Then this is what you need!\nA Revival Herb!\c\nIts crazy bitter taste and smell will make a\nfainted Pokémon spring awake in an instant!
But remember: herbal medicines are all pretty\nbitter, so Pokémon don’t really like taking them.\c\nIf there’s anything else you want to know about,\njust come and ask me anytime!
I like to mash my Energy Powder in with rice\nand just swallow it whole!\c\nJust thinking about it gets me raring to go!
I kept feeding my Pokémon herbal medicine,\nand I think they ended up hating me...
Raaawr!
Oh, do let me recommend an herbal remedy\nfor a fabulously stylish customer like you!

Foolish girl! You’re not here to make friends with\nthe Berries! You’re here to mash them into a pulp!
Unghhhh! Squeeeeeze!\nTake that! And that!
The secrets of how to make Berry Juice are only\npassed down to a select few...\c\nWhen a master is so harsh to his disciples, it is\nproof that they have been found worthy.
When you drink Berry Juice with your\nPokémon, you end up feeling energized, too!\c\nYou should’ve seen the way my husband was\nfrolicking about last night!\c\nYou would have thought he was a teenager again!
Myraaawwwr!

Fighters who want to master the art of\nPokémon battles gather here.
Moves, Abilities, and items that seem to have\nonly adverse effects can actually be positive\r\nif you combine them with other elements.
Some Abilities have effects when the Pokémon\nwith that Ability takes a direct attack.\c\nThat means, if your Pokémon attacks\nthe opposing Pokémon carelessly,\r\nyour Pokémon may get hurt!
Some Abilities take effect when a\nPokémon enters battle.\c\nIn these cases, the order in which\nPokémon enter battle is important!\c\nSometimes being later than the\nopposing Pokémon works better.
Some moves enable the user to attack first\nregardless of the Pokémon’s Speed.
We’re asking our master to teach us\nas a special favor!
What do martial artists serve at a party?\nAll kinds of punch...
It’s best to enjoy battles!\c\nIf I lose and get frustrated,\nI’ll listen to what everyone else says.
Lucaaa!

Or maybe even...
Oh yes, I’ll give you the rights to a brilliant piece\nof copy, so why not use it in a Trainer PR Video?
Yes, my brilliance just never ceases.\nIt is as natural as breathing to me...\c\nWill the world ever stop clamoring\nfor my genius and leave me in peace?

If you want to make a fantastic Trainer PR Video,\nyou’ve got to have the right music playing!\c\nThe exact same video can look either lovely or\nfrightful just by changing the background music!

The more Pokémon that you trade, the more\nPokémon you’ll have with different IDs!\c\nIn other words, the better your chances at winning\nthe Loto-ID! I’m a genius, right?
Don’t duck away! Just take a pluck. Try your luck!\nCome every day! That’s the Loto-ID way! ☆
I’ve been training nonstop to win the Loto-ID!\nWhat’s that? You say no one can train for that?
I like to sit here and watch the wild gamut of\nemotions from the people playing the Loto-ID.
I’ve come all the way out from Azure Bay today,\njust so that I could try the Loto-ID!

The Eerie Impulse that some Pokémon can emit...\nI wonder what about it is all that eerie.
Well, would you look at that!\nYour [VAR PKNAME(0000)] there knows Eerie Impulse!\c\nPlease! Won’t you have it show me its\nEerie Impulse move? Just once?
[VAR PKNAME(0000)] used Eerie Impulse!
Aha! So it’s the frequency of the wave!\nI understand completely now.\c\nThank you! You’ve been a great help!
It seems that the Eerie Impulse that some Pokémon\ncan emit lowers the Sp. Attack stat of targets with\r\nthe peculiar frequency of the impulse’s wavelength!
Mom and Dad left us behind to travel around\nthe world. All to train their Pokémon.\c\nThat’s why my little brother, Trevor, has always\ndreamed of traveling all over Kalos with a\r\nPokédex of his own...

Ah! Well, this is embarrassing...\nYou don’t seem to have the money, dear customer.
Hmm... But, dear customer...\c\nYou don’t seem to have a Furfrou with you today,\nnow do you?
Which lovely Furfrou will we be working on today?
And what kind of style were you thinking of?\nOur trims are unparalleled in the Kalos region!
Heart Trim

Then let me just borrow your lovely Furfrou\nfor an eensy-weensy moment!
Snip...[WAIT 5] Snippity-snip...[WAIT 5]\nSnip-snip... Snip!
Thank you for your patience!\c\nMy work is complete!\c\nYour lovely Furfrou was the ideal model!\nSuch a well-behaved Pokémon!
All right then!\c\nI’ll just ring up your total, shall I?
If you ever wish to try out a new style, you know\nwhere to come! We’ll be waiting at Friseur Furfrou!
So, you would like to keep the same style and just\ntouch up the ends a bit, is that right?
Oh? So, it’s to be au naturale, is it?\nYou’d like to return your Furfrou to its natural look?
What’s this? You want me to style an Egg?\nFeeling a bit hasty, are we, dear customer?
Oh, I am so terribly, terribly, terribly sorry.\c\nWe simply don’t do work on any Pokémon but\nFurfrou here. You do understand, don’t you?
Hmm? Are you sure?\nNothing will change. Is that fine with you?
Would you like me to inform you of how long your\nFurfrou has kept this magnificent style?\c\nI am the owner and head stylist, after all.\nI simply know these things, darling.\c\nSo...would you like to know? Oui ou non?
I hope you will come visit us again.\nÀ bientôt!
Which dear Furfrou would you like to know\nabout then? En fait?
Pardonne-moi, but that is an Egg, dear customer.\nAn Egg has no hair, and thus I cannot trim it!
Pardonne-moi, but that is not a Furfrou.\nDo you take me for an amateur?
Pardonne-moi, but you have no Furfrou with you.\nWhat exactly is it that you’re hoping I can do?
Quel surprise!\c\nYour Furfrou has maintained its beautiful look for\n[VAR NUM4(0000,002C)] day[VAR NUMBRNCH(0000,0100)]s now!\c\nOhhh, it’s so beautifully done that I could\njust eat it up!
Quel shock...\c\nYour dear Furfrou has not managed to maintain\nits beautiful look for even one day yet...\c\nOh, it’s so beautifully disappointed.\nPerhaps I should just eat my words...
A Furfrou trim, hmm?\nIt will grow out in about five days.\c\nTheir pelts do grow quickly, don’t they?
Hey, hey, guess what! My precious Furfur and me\nare totally in sync with each other!\c\nAfter all, we get up at the same time, eat at the\nsame times, and go to bed at the same time!
Bouaf?

Poor sensei...\c\nHe came all the way from the Kanto region\nto open a Fighting Dojo, and this was the\r\nonly place he could afford to rent.\c\nAnd now he’s only getting students to sign\nup because he’s calling it a dance studio!
Hey! Take this!
If you give a Pokémon a Protein,\nits base Attack stat will go up.\c\nYou can also increase base stats like\nAttack and Speed by winning battles!
This is a belt used in karate dancing.\nPlease put it on one of your Pokémon.
It’ll make your supereffective moves\neven more super effective! Nice, huh?
Karate dancing is super fun!\nWhirl and punch, spin and block!
If I’m going to try to take on Korrina,\nI’ve got to start by learning to fight!

That look! That outfit!\nIt’s just beyond words!
I’m sure someone like you could use this\nPrism Scale and really accessorize!
Anyone can become beautiful, you know.\nAs long as they are in Lumiose City, that is!
A real adult can wear their clothes with panache.\nYou look like you’re being worn by your clothes.
I’m the type of person that likes to get several\nsets of all my favorite clothes and accessories!\c\nLike, for example, I have two white coats that’re\njust like the one Professor Sycamore wears, right?\r\nBut one is two millimeters longer than the other!
You want to know what’s in fashion now?\nDressing up as a Pokémon is a big hit.\c\nWhat could be hotter than a Magnemite\nor a Magmortar? Oooh--or a Sliggoo!
How can I express the attraction\nof Pokémon with cheap words?

C’est la vie! At least I have\nPokémon here beside me...\r\nThat’s life, n’est-ce pas?
I love to see the dashing pompiers at work!\nI suppose you would call them “firefighters.”\c\nAlways first on the scene, and then when\ntheir Pokémon use Water Gun... Ooh-la-la!

Pokémon grow resentful of their Trainers\nif they’re often knocked out in battles...

Combine different Abilities wisely, and you might\nachieve something fantastic in Double Battles!
I feel, like, totally fulfilled just by\nhaving my Pokémon by my side.\c\nA world without Pokémon? Pshaw!\nI can’t even imagine livin’ like that.
Pangoro is the only living creature in\nthis whole world who really gets me...

Then let’s begin the Battle Test at once!\c\nPlease bear in mind that once you start,\nyou’ll face five battles without a break.\c\nIf you’re ready for that, please choose\nthe Pokémon you’d like to battle with.
Let the Single Battle Test begin!
Let the Double Battle Test begin!
Next is the second round! Start!
We’re still just beginning!\nThird round...start!
The end is in sight!\nFourth round...start!
It all comes down to this!\nFifth and final round...start!
Good effort out there. Let’s see\nthe results of your Battle Test...\c\nBased on your results, you are...
Master Rank! A-a-amazing! How about\ngiving me a few pointers next time, huh?
Elite Rank! Goodness me!\nYou can definitely brag to your friends about that.
Hyper Rank! That is impressive.\nYou must be practicing quite a bit.
Super Rank! You’re quite strong, aren’t you?
Normal Rank!\nIt seems your abilities are about average.
Novice Rank... Hmm, I see.\nYou could try a bit harder.
Oh... Beginner Rank.\nMaybe you should brush up on your basics.
Well, last but not least, I’ll award you with\nBP and prizes for your efforts on the test!
[VAR TRNAME(0000)] received [VAR NUM2(0001)] BP!
O-oh, you’d like to try? I’m sorry...\c\nIt’s probably still too early for you\nto try any of the Battle Tests here.\c\nPlease come back after you finish\nyour journey and grow stronger.

In a Battle Test, you battle against\nfive Trainers in a row without pause.\c\nI will evaluate your skill at Pokémon\nbattling based on those five battles.\c\nYou can receive Battle Points--or BP\nfor short--based on how you battle!\c\nAnd I’ve also arranged for prizes to be\nawarded based on your performance!
In this Battle Institute, we like to have an even\nplaying field, so all Pokémon battle at Lv. 50.\c\nSelect three Pokémon for a Single Battle Test\nand four Pokémon for the Double Battle Test.\c\nAll of your Pokémon and all of the items they\nhold must be different. No duplicates allowed!
Download Tests are special Battle Tests that\ncan be downloaded during certain times via\r\nthe Internet or from a special-event location.\c\nThere are two connections you can use: a\nlocal connection or a network connection.\c\nPlease select the appropriate connection\nbased on the environment that you are in.
We hope to see you again!
Keep trying and don’t give up!\nI finally reached Super Rank!
To take a Battle Test, you\nhave to be even stronger\r\nthan the Champion, you know!
...So I guess that means\nthat you should be fine!

Stop right there!
Ahahahaha! Sorry, sorry. We always\nseem to be surprising you, don’t we?\c\nWe’re just here to give you something\nthe professor forgot about last time.
...Central Kalos!\c\n...Coastal Kalos!\c\n...Mountain Kalos!\c\nThere are more Pokémon\nin Kalos than you’ll find\r\nin those three Pokédexes!\r\nDidja know that?
That’s basically what we’re here about.\nWe’ll power up your Pokédex for you!
The National Pokédex has now been added to\n[VAR TRNAME(0000)]’s Pokédex!
The National Pokédex has been\nadded to your Pokédex menu.\r\nJust tap it to check it out, OK?
You’d better keep on treasuring the time you\nget with your Pokémon from now on, got it?\c\nThis precious time that you fought for...
How did you like your\nparade, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]?
So the reason I asked\nyou to come here is...\c\nI wanted to give you a\npass to Kiloude City!
Doesn’t ring any bells?
Kiloude City is a city in the\nsouthern part of the Kalos region.\c\nAnd it’s the perfect place for Trainers\nlooking to sharpen their skills!
So here’s your pass for the\nsuper high-speed rail to Kiloude City!
Use it to ride the TMV super high-speed rail!\c\nTake your pass to that scanner over there.\nIt’s an orange machine. Have the machine scan\r\nyour pass to board the train.
Have a fantastic time!
It should be someplace\nright around here, right?
These trains are completely different from\nthe subways we have in the Unova region!
They say the world’s fastest train\ncan go an unbelievable 310 mph!
The TMV... It’s super fast...\nand super shaky... Urgh...
It’s a TMV timetable.
Something is written on\nthe back of the timetable.\c\n“I’m going to go for help.\nWait in the usual place.”
It’s a TMV pass scanner.
Would you like to scan your pass\nand board the TMV train?
You can’t board without a pass.
You scanned your pass!
It’s a TMV ticket dispenser.
You know, cameras and railways were\nfirst developed around the same time.\c\nIn short, that means railway enthusiasts\nlike myself have been able to capture\r\nthese lovelies on film from the start!
Checking train times online is much easier,\nisn’t it? I guess even timetables evolve.\c\nThough I did always like staring up at that\nhuge array of numbers, just imagining all\r\nthe different possibilities awaiting me...

There’s a report on the desk.\c\n“When I was young, I went on a journey\naround Kalos with my Pokémon.\c\nI reached out to help those suffering\nbecause they had nothing.\c\nAt first, they were grateful, but eventually,\nthey began to take my help for granted\r\nand demand more and more...\c\nWill fools like those people consume\nthe Kalos region?\c\nThis world is stable and secure.\nSo the population of people and Pokémon\r\ncontinues to increase unabated.\c\nBut there is a limit to the amount\nof money and energy the world\r\nis capable of producing.\c\nEither everything is lost, or only a\nhandful are saved.\c\nThis is something best not left to man...\nI must use a tool of higher power.”
There’s research material\non the bookshelf.\c\n“Over the ages, people and Pokémon\nworked alongside one another and\r\ncreated many things.\c\nAs a result of this, a leader appeared\namong the humans.\c\nThat leader sought to produce\neven more goods.\c\nIncreased production of goods created\na gap between haves and have-nots.”
There’s research material\non the bookshelf.\c\n“The mountains will never know one another,\nbut people can encounter other people.\r\nAnd people and Pokémon mix together.”
There’s research material on the bookshelf.\c\n“Full of sorrow, AZ built the ultimate weapon.\nWhen he did this, he left the following words.\c\n‘What’s wrong with bringing something you love\nback into this world?\c\nWithout my beloved Pokémon, no other Pokémon\nhave any meaning!’”
There’s research material on the bookshelf.\c\n“The king’s younger brother told his progeny\nthe location of the ultimate weapon and died.\c\nThat is something to be used by sophisticated\npowers, not by humans.\c\nHuman beings must create a world where\nsuch a weapon is unnecessary...”
There’s research material\non the bookshelf.\c\n“When AZ, the man who was king, vanished,\nhe took the key to the ultimate weapon.\c\nThat is the item required\nto activate the weapon.”
There’s research material on the bookshelf.\n“AZ had a younger brother.\c\nIt’s said he led a legion of greedy souls\nwho wanted to seize the Kalos region.\c\nHis dark intention was to make it his own.\c\nBut when he saw how Kalos had been\nravaged by the war, he took the weapon\r\nhis brother had created, and he buried\r\nthat weapon deep underground.”
There’s research material\non the bookshelf.\c\n“The king was proud of the technology\nhe had used to bring Kalos prosperity, but\c\nhe couldn’t help but use it in a way\nthat had never been intended...\c\nAZ, the man who was king, disappeared.”
There’s research material\non the bookshelf.\c\n“The king couldn’t escape war with\nthose who targeted a wealthy Kalos.\c\nThe war grew so violent and ugly,\nthe king was forced to send his own\r\nbeloved Pokémon into battle.”
There’s research material\non the bookshelf.\c\n“The king’s name was AZ, and\nhe was both the beginning and the end.\c\nHe used technology unlike any seen\nduring that era to unite Kalos\r\nfor the first time.”

Oh! Well, of course you’re not!\nYou have your Pokémon, huh?
We gather data about all the Trainers\nin the region through the Holo Caster,\r\nso we know all about you guys.\c\nAnd you know how the Mega Ring is\nused to awaken a Pokémon’s power, right?\c\nJust like how the ultimate weapon can\nmax out a Pokémon’s power.\c\nHeheh... Looks like you and me are\npractically after the same thing, yeah?
Ding-ding-ding! Yup, you did it!\c\nTo the victor goes the spoils!\nHere! An elevator key for you!
The power of the Legendary Pokémon...\nThe power to grant life to all around it...\c\nIt’s a mysterious ability that even scientists\nlike us haven’t been able to really decode.\c\nWhat d’you think will happen to the world if we\nfuel the ultimate weapon with something like that?

Yup. That sounds good to me.\nThen I’ll get in the first blow!
Oh! What a brute!\nLook at poor Celosia!
What’s this?! Who would have thought\na child like you could beat us both?\c\nYou and your Pokémon were utterly\nin sync in that battle, and I know why.\c\nYou’re here for answers, aren’t you?\nI suppose we’re at your mercy.\c\nI will tell you what I know, at least.
We’ve been using the electricity we stole from\nthe Power Plant to get everything prepared for\r\nactivating the ultimate weapon.\c\nBut it’s not like that’s all we’ll need to use it.\c\nAre you following me?\c\nWe’ll need energy absorbed from Pokémon to\npower the device!\c\nYes! It’s the stones on Route 10 that will steal\nthat energy for us and power the ultimate weapon!
That’s right. The stones on Route 10 normally\nput out energy, but when the ultimate weapon is\r\nactivated, that reverses and they begin to absorb\r\nenergy from Pokémon!
In reality, those stones that line Route 10\nare the graves of Pokémon.\c\nWhen the ultimate weapon was used to end\nthat horrible war over 3,000 years ago,\r\nit stole the lives of all those Pokémon.\c\nTheir lives were the price of peace then.\c\nAnd if we want to make our own wishes\ncome true today, we in Team Flare also\r\nhave to sacrifice something precious.
One of the mysterious stones you saw alongside\nRoute 10...
Can this stone really be used to absorb a\nPokémon’s energy?

We’re looking for a really tall guy...\c\nAnd I mean tall. If you stretched out a\nSeviper and stood it up, he’d be that tall.\c\nWe received some intelligence that Team Flare\nis also trying to find him for some reason.
His relationship to Team Flare\nis still a mystery, but...
Oh, by the way, I’ve got something for you.\nTake these with you, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].
Oh, wait! We met some time ago,\nbut I didn’t get your name then!\c\nI’ve never heard your name before!\nNot once!
Uh... Anyway...\c\nWe came here--at a certain professor’s\nrequest--to stop Team Flare!\c\nI assume your goal is the same?\nDon’t do anything reckless, OK?
What is that Lysandre guy thinking?!\c\nI thought he wanted a beautiful world...
The professor’s feeling pretty down, but\nhe’s using his network of acquaintances\r\nto try to stop Team Flare’s plan.

Wah ha ha!\c\nYour convictions, and those of your Pokémon,\nplease me!
You are here to stop me.\c\nBut I ask you to wait.\c\nI tried to save people--and the world--with the\nprofit from this lab.\r\nBut my efforts had no effect...\c\nThe world was just too vast...and too full of\nfools that I couldn’t save through my hard\r\nwork alone...\c\nThat’s why I decided the only way to save the\nworld was to take it all for myself.
I don’t expect that I will ever make you\nunderstand how I think and feel...\c\nTry to stop the ultimate weapon if you must,\nbut to do so, you will have to explore our lab\r\nand have Pokémon battles with all you meet.
Oh, and as for the Elevator Key,\none of the Team Flare Scientists\r\nyou’ve met on your journey has it.

I had fun at the Kalos Power Plant.\c\nOf course, we could have generated electricity\nwith Team Flare’s technology, too, you know.\c\nWe just didn’t think it justified the cost.\c\nTo create a world for us and us alone,\nwe have to play it smart, you see.

The only thing left to do is put the plan in motion.\c\nI’m counting on you.
One push of a button, and we can activate\nthe ultimate weapon from this room.
I believe being a chosen one means you\nhave the potential to change the future!\c\nWhether we activate the ultimate weapon\nor leave it safely underground will rest upon\r\nif you actually have this potential or not.
Oh ho ho!\c\nYou’re the one I’ve heard so much about!\nI’ve been waiting for you!
I need to do a little research on you!\nCome, let us begin!
Wonderful!\nAmazing!\c\nYou have tremendous skill and bravery!\c\nWhen you add that up, it means I will\ntell you something very interesting.
It happened 3,000 years ago.\c\nThe ultimate weapon was used to put an end\nto the war in an instant.\c\nIf we use that incredible power, we can finally\nfree Kalos of the foolish humans that plague it!
Behind me you’ll find\na [VAR COLOR(0001)]red button[VAR COLOR(0000)] and a [VAR COLOR(0002)]blue button[VAR COLOR(0000)].\c\nOne of them is the button for\nactivating the ultimate weapon.\c\nPush one now!\nCome on! Push one!

Come on! Look!\nLook at the monitor!
Did you see?\nThe ultimate weapon is reborn!\r\nThe poisonous flower has bloomed!\r\nAll shall perish! Except for Team Flare!

Listen, one who will face Lysandre.
Get the key back.\c\nIt should not be used.\nEverything will vanish again.\c\nDo you want to know unending\npain...like I have?
That is AZ.\c\nHe has the same name as a king that lived\n3,000 years ago.\c\nAnd for some unknown reason, he had the key\nto the ultimate weapon hung around his neck.

Over here!
I was just having a conversation with\nLysandre about Mega Evolution.
I would like to congratulate you as well.\c\nMega Evolution is something I, too,\nwould like to be able to use.
Actually, Lysandre himself is of royal ancestry...\nHe truly is a chosen one.
True. I’m a descendant of the king’s\nyounger brother.\c\nThat being said, that story is 3,000 years old,\nso it might not be entirely reliable.
By the way, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]...\c\nDo you know where the Holo Caster is made?
That’s right!\c\nThey’re made in Lysandre’s lab.
Oh really?\c\nWell, they just happen to\nbe made in Lysandre’s lab.
Lysandre is a great man.\c\nHe supports Trainers and Pokémon research\nwith some of the profit from the Holo Caster.
People can be divided into two groups.\c\nThose who give...\nAnd those who take...\c\nIt’s just as how the Kalos region’s two\nLegendary Pokémon gave life and took life.
I want to be the kind of person who gives...\c\nBut in this world, some foolish humans exist\nwho would show their strength by taking\r\nwhat isn’t theirs.
They’re filth!
Long, long ago, the king of Kalos\nsought to take everything for his own,\r\nand he created a terrible weapon.\c\nThen the fire of destruction was unleashed...\nThat is the legend that has been passed down.
Kalos is beautiful right now!\c\nThere will be no foolish actions if the number\nof people and Pokémon do not increase.
That being said, the future isn’t decided.\c\nYou can’t be sure each day will be like the\none before.
What the king of Kalos did was reprehensible, but...\c\nThe ultimate weapon did manage to wash\nthe world clean of that era’s filth.
Thank you for listening.\c\nTake that as an apology for my taking up\nyour time.
What a passionate person.\nHe’s just like a blazing flame.\c\nPerhaps his pride in his lineage is\nwhat makes him burn so intensely.
That being said, what Lysandre says\nis only one way of looking at things...\r\nIt’s not necessarily the truth.\c\n[VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\c\nWhat’s truly important is the time\nyou spend together with others!\c\nTreasure these moments spent traveling\nthe Kalos region with your Pokémon!
Welcome to Lysandre Café.
Today, our special is...\nget out of here or else!
Oh no! [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0201)]HShe'll find out the password to\nthe hidden door in this café is “open sesame”!

The development of the Poké Ball\nreally brought Pokémon\r\nand humans closer together!
My personal recommendation is the Quick Ball!
If you run into a Pokémon you really want,\ntry throwing a Quick Ball right away!
My personal recommendation is the Timer Ball!
The Timer Ball works really well for catching\npowerful Pokémon that can heal themselves.
Your [VAR PKNAME(0000)]\nis so very charming!
Oh, Espurr! Please stop pulling\npranks with your psychic power!
Meo ho ho!
If you catch a Pokémon, your Pokémon will\ngain experience, too!\r\nIt’s a win-win for real!

Well now, you DO have a certain\nje ne sais quoi!\c\nI have a good feeling about you!
At first, I was thinking of choosing\nonly one child from a town when I was\r\ndeciding who to give a Pokémon to.\c\nIn Vaniville Town, it was going to be\nthe child of a Veteran Trainer I know.
About then, I learned that the Rhyhorn racer\nGrace and her [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0803)]sondaughter were moving here.\c\nHere in the Kalos region, you’re far away\nfrom everything you used to know...\c\nThat really hit me right here...\c\nThen it hit me--I should give you a Pokémon\nand have you travel around Kalos!
Hi, Professor!\nIt’s Shauna. 
Sorry to have kept you waiting.
Sorry to have kept you waiting.
Fantastic! Now, let’s all have\na Pokémon battle!
Your opponent shall be me!
A Pokémon battle in the lab?
A Pokémon battle, huh?\nSounds good. Let’s get started.
Why are you the one who gets\nto battle the professor?
Shall we start the battle?
Just so you know,\nI’m not that tough!
No problem at all! I’ll wait!\nI’ll wait as long as I must!
I think I’ve about figured it out!
Figured what out?
[VAR TRNAME(0000)]! You are an interesting\nPokémon Trainer indeed!
It’d be fantastic if you took\nanother Pokémon with you!
Here!\nPick one!
[~ 24]
Maybe I’ll try collecting Pokémon\nof the same type.
I recommend picking a Pokémon\ntype that complements your team.
I guess I’ll pick a Pokémon with a type that\ncompensates for my team’s weaknesses.
You picked [VAR PKNAME(0002)], then!\nI see. That’s simply wonderful!
Would you like to give your Pokémon\na nickname?
So, you’ve decided its nickname\nwill be [VAR PKNICK(0005)]?
Oh, I see. You’re not going to give\nyour Pokémon a nickname, then.
Since you chose Bulbasaur,\nI’ll give you this Mega Stone.
Since you chose Charmander,\nI’ll give you this Mega Stone.
Since you chose Squirtle,\nI’ll give you this Mega Stone.
Come now, you two.\nPick your Pokémon.
I don’t know which one to pick!\nIt’s so difficult!
You’ll be together\nfor a long time,\r\nso just take your time.
It’s OK. Take your time.
Well, I’ve got a feeling everyone\nelse will show up soon.
Hi, Professor Sycamore.
What’s this? Everyone is already here.
See.
Wonderful!\nEveryone’s all here!
So now that we’re all here,\nI’d like to say a few words.
Be the best Trainer you can be!\c\nAt the same time, remember to have\nfun traveling with your Pokémon!\c\nAlso, I want to ask for your help in solving the\nKalos region’s biggest Pokémon mystery:\r\nthe secret and potential of Mega Evolution,\r\na new kind of Evolution that occurs in battle!\c\nThat’s why I gave you that Mega Stone just now.\nIt’s an important clue!
Mega Evolution?\nWhat should we do about the Pokédex?
Trevor, my lad, if that’s what “best Trainer”\nmeans to you, then I want you to go out there\r\nand complete that Pokédex!
Mega Evolution sounds really interesting! ♪
If you’re investigating Mega Evolution,\nwhy don’t you check out Camphrier Town?\c\nThat town has a lot of history--you might\nfind a hint there!
Now listen.\c\nIf you visit many different places to complete the\nPokédex, you will probably see Pokémon\r\nwith many ways of living and meet\r\npeople with many ways of thinking.\c\nFirst, accept the ways of living and thinking\nthat sometimes conflict with your own.\c\nAnd think about what’s really important--this\nwill truly broaden your horizons.
I feel that being different from others\nmakes me special.\c\nMastering Mega Evolution will definitely\nset me apart from other Trainers!
I think being different from others\nis part of what makes me special.\c\nMastering Mega Evolution will definitely\nset me apart from other Trainers!
Hmm... I guess I want to make\nlots and lots of good memories.
The best Trainer...\c\nIf being the best Trainer had\nmore to do with dancing,\r\nthen I might have a chance.
Oh! Uh, I’ll complete the Pokédex, then!
The number of Pokémon you’ve encountered\nin the Central Kalos Pokédex is...\c\n[VAR NUM3(0000)]!
Tell me when you encounter\n20 or more!\r\nI’ll give you something nice.
I’ll give you this item so you can\nbefriend even more Pokémon!
The move False Swipe leaves\na Pokémon with 1 HP instead\r\nof making it faint.\c\nIt’s super useful when you’re\ntrying to catch Pokémon!
Your party is full!\c\nPlease choose a Pokémon to send to the PC Box.
Oh! So you don’t want it right now?\c\nCome back and get your Pokémon\nonce you’ve organized your PC Boxes.
Oh! But it looks like your Boxes\nare all full, aren’t they?\c\nCome back and get your Pokémon\nonce you’ve organized your PC Boxes.

The professor is researching\nEvolution and change.\c\nI heard that he learned a lot\nfrom Prof. Rowan in Sinnoh\r\nwhen he was young.
I’m developing a tool that will help my research.\c\nIt’s pretty difficult work. Please wait\npatiently for it to be completed!
Hi, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].\c\nI developed a tool to facilitate\nPokémon research.\c\nIf you like, please use it.\nIt can double as a test, too.
It’s the Pokémon Radar,\nor Poké Radar for short.\c\nUse it in tall grass, and you’ll\nknow where Pokémon are hiding.\c\nIt’s a great tool.
And!\c\nIf you find a Pokémon, it will\nkeep searching for another\r\nPokémon of the same species!\c\nThere’s no guarantee that you\ncan find a Pokémon, though...
The important thing about the Poké Radar\nis that you can encounter the same\r\nPokémon species over again.\c\nAs you know, even Pokémon of the same\nspecies can have very different characteristics.\c\nTo research their characteristics,\nI’d like to collect as much data on\r\nthe same Pokémon as possible.
I’ll let you know what the target Pokémon is\nfor the research of the day.\c\nWhen you have the chance,\nplease help me with my research.
Hi there, [VAR TRNAME(0000)].\c\nToday’s research target is\n[VAR PKNAME(0001)].\c\nThanks!

There are male Pokémon, female Pokémon,\nand even Pokémon with unknown genders.\c\nSome Pokémon have a different\nappearance depending on gender.

I’ve been waiting for you.\c\nI must ask you to make all of the beds\non this floor within [VAR NUM3(0000)] second[VAR NUMBRNCH(0000,0100)]s.
Well, if it isn’t M[VAR GENDBR(00FF,0305)]asteriss [VAR TRNAME(0000)].\c\nYou know, it’s said that people learn little from\nsuccess, but much from failure.\c\nI suppose that’s neither here nor there, though.\c\nI’d like you to please make all of the beds on this\nfloor within [VAR NUM3(0001)] second[VAR NUMBRNCH(0001,0100)]s.
Please get to work at once.
Is there some sort of problem?\nAre you giving up on your assignment already?
I see.\c\nI will have to report this to the manager.\c\nPlease excuse me.
Then you should make all of the beds on this floor\nwithin [VAR NUM3(0000)] second[VAR NUMBRNCH(0000,0100)]s.\c\nRemember that time is precious in housekeeping!\c\nQuick work creates a surplus of time,\nand extra time creates better work.

The bed is full of Pokémon dander...
The bed has had Lemonade spilled on it...
The pillow is at the foot of\nthis bed for some reason...
The bed reeks of perfume...
The bed still feels warm...
The bed is covered with Pokémon footprints...
The bed appears to have been chewed on...
The bed is littered with glittering scales...
The sheets are wet on this bed...
Something has chewed a hole\nthrough the sheets on this bed...
The bed has brand-new sheets\nand nary a wrinkle to be seen!
A perfectly made bed!\nYou could bounce a coin off it!
You have finished making\nall the beds on this floor!
Thank you for your hard work!\c\nIt took you more than [VAR NUM3(0000)] second[VAR NUMBRNCH(0000,0100)]s\nto make all these beds. That is...
Absolutely perfect!\nI am so happy, I could cry!
No less than I would expect.\c\nBut...I suspect you are capable of more.\nNext time, your absolute utmost efforts, please.
Oh? What’s this?\nCould I have mistaken your time?\c\nCertainly not. Should I remind you again?\nTime is precious when it comes to housekeeping.\c\nWasting even one moment is just\nas bad as wasting an entire day.

You think you can just ride for free?!\nGive me my money! Give it to me, punk!
Now I’m never gonna hit my quota\nfor the day! Awww, this day stinks!
Why, you! You won’t get away with this!\nThat money is my life! My rent! My dinner!
Fine! Whatever! I get it!\nJust get outta my taxi!
You won’t be getting away with this!\nYou little sneak! I’ll teach you a lesson!
Tsk... Fine. I mean, great.\nThanks for riding with me.
You’d better not be getting cocky, kid.\nOtherwise your Pokémon’ll pay for you!
I’m still proud of myself.\nG’wan, get outta here. Forget the fare!
Just what I was hoping for!\nThis should help wake me up!
That was good! Let’s do it again sometime!\nBut bring some money and pay your fare!
I come out to earn a living, don’t I?\nSo why you gotta tax me like this?
Now I won’t even have a copper to\nsend back to my family in Hoenn...
I won’t go easy just because you’re\na child! Feel my Judgment, thief!
I’m begging you, child. Don’t keep\ndoing these kinds of illicit things.
Riding without paying is a crime!\nI’ll run you down, you little thief!
My Pokémon came to a screeching halt...\nIdling is just the same as stopping, really...
Beep! Beep! Brrrrr-ooom!\nI used to be a Biker, buddy!
The only thing in my wallet is air...\nMy pocketbook’s just gathering dust...
Watch out, kid, we Drivers are strong!\nDriving these roads takes real strength!
You’re strong. You wanna join us?\nYou can make bank if you work hard!
Oho... Slow down there, kid.\nI’ll bounce off you like a speed bump.
Aha. You managed to just beat me.\nMy tank’s empty...and the same for my team...

Quiz time!
Which one is Vivillon?\nIs it No. 1, is it No. 2, or is it No. 3?
Go talk to the Trainer who’s the\nsame number as the right answer!
Buzz! Too bad, so sad!\nThat was obviously the wrong answer!\c\nI guess you’ll have to fight another Trainer.
Ding-ding-ding! You’re correct!\nWell, aren’t you a clever one!
Please stand in the answering area!
Then step into the elevator!
If you want to hear the question\nagain, step on the small panel!
No. 1? Really?
Is it really No. 1?\nOr is it not No. 1?
Take your time, then.
I think that No. 1 is\nreally Butterfree, you know.
Wow, you’re seriously\ngoing to pick No. 2?
Then let’s see if\nyou were right!
Yeah. I’m not too sure\nabout this one, either.
Who do you think even\nwrote these questions?
You sure you want No. 3?
We’ll have to battle before you find\nout who’s right! Life is harsh like that!
Don’t second-guess yourself!
Ahhh, what a blow!\nLife is harsh like that!

Please stand in the answering area!

If you want to hear the question\nagain, step on the small panel!
Could it be that you did not choose\nPansage as an answer so much\r\nas you chose me to battle with?
Do you think you’ll make\nit onto the next elevator?
Take your time.
Don’t let Clemont down!
Are you sure it’s Pansear,\nin your heart of hearts?
A Pokémon battle! That is indeed\nthe path to truth and answers!
It’s good to think things through,\nbut mindlessly battling is good, too.
Forge your path with Pokémon!\nYou are a Trainer, after all!
I don’t know, kid...\nYou sure about Panpour?
You’re ready to take responsibility\nfor your own choices, are you?
I can’t argue with that. It’s up to you to decide\nhow you spend the time you have.
When a Trainer decides something,\n[VAR GENDBR(00FF,0100)]she also decides h[VAR GENDBR(00FF,0202)]iser Pokémon’s fate.

Bird Pokémon, hmmm. Their silhouettes sure\ndo come in all kinds of different shapes...\c\nBut you think it’s Fletchling, do you?
OK, but this is still a Pokémon Gym.\nIt wouldn’t seem right if we didn’t fight.
So which Pokémon is the correct answer?
To be able to identify a Pokémon\nby its silhouette is really something.
Oh? You think it’s Pidgey?
Let’s find out, shall we?
Feel free to take your time...
This is a Pokémon Gym, after all, so we want\nto test your powers of observation as well.
So Taillow is the answer your\nlove of Pokémon has led you to?
Then let me see just what your\nlove for Pokémon is made of!
It is difficult, isn’t it?\nGive it a good think.
These quizzes are all made\nto test your love for Pokémon.

Ah! You’re that Trainer from before!\nCome straight for a battle, have you?\c\nWell, good! You can call me Bonnie.\nI’m this Gym Leader’s younger sister.\c\nGo ahead and step onto that small square\na few steps directly ahead of you, would you?\c\nYou will have to answer my questions\nif you want to get any farther ahead!
Quiz time!
Who’s that Pokémon?!\c\n1. Emolga      2. Dedenne\n3. Pikachu
Go talk to the Trainer who’s the\nsame number as the right answer!
Buzz! Too bad, so sad!\nThat was obviously the wrong answer!\c\nI guess you’ll have to fight another Trainer.
Ding-ding-ding! You’re correct!\nWell, aren’t you a clever one!
Please stand in the answering area!
Then step into the elevator!
If you want to hear the question\nagain, step on the small panel!
Are you sure it’s Emolga?
You’ll have to beat me to find\nout if you’re right or not!
Please think carefully.
At least there was nothing\nwrong about your strength!
Dedenne is your answer?
Heh heh...
Think about it lo-o-o-ong\nand hard, mmm-kay?
I wouldn’t be surprised if you answered\nwrong on purpose, just to battle more.
You’ve chosen Pikachu?
Let’s have a Pokémon battle\nbefore we compare answers!
No need for you to rush.\nWe aren’t going anywhere.
That was quite the effort!

Oh! Thank you again for coming.\nAllow me to introduce myself...
This is the Gym Leader of Lumiose City, Clemont!\c\nYou’d better watch out! My brother’s strong!\c\nAs strong as you’d expect a Lumiose City\nGym Leader to be, got it?
Bonnie! How many times do I have to remind you...\c\nIt’s not my own strength that matters, nor any\nother Trainer’s.\c\nNone of us would be here if it weren’t for\nour Pokémon.
I know, I know!
Anyway, I hope you two have an awesome battle!
She’s right about that, at least.\nLet’s both do our best in battle.
M-my brother...\nYou lost?
Oh, Bonnie...\nWhen will you learn there’s no shame in losing?\c\nI’m glad whenever I get to learn something new\nthanks to strong challengers like this [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0403)]boygirl here.
Now, to the victor go the spoils!\nThis Voltage Badge belongs to you!
[VAR TRNAME(0000)] received the\nVoltage Badge from Clemont!
If you have a Voltage Badge, you will be seen as a\nfriend and equal by any Pokémon up to Lv. 70.\c\nAnd here. Take this TM as well...
Oh, I know! I know this one!\nIt’s TM24! That’s Thunderbolt!\c\nIt has a power of 90, and\nits accuracy is 100 percent!\r\nIt’ll never miss!\c\nIt’s a really popular Electric move because of that!
Arghhh! Bonnie, you--!\n... ... ...
The future is now, thanks to science!\c\nBehold the machine that gives:\nTechnical Machines!
...I just wanted to be able to say it, OK?\nAt least once.
Look, I’m not... It’s not like I’m just trying to make\nmyself stronger or...\c\n... ... ...\c\nAll I’m trying to do is enjoy every day to the\nfullest with my Pokémon, while doing the science\r\nthat I love with my inventing.
You’re a pretty amazing\nPokémon Trainer, huh?\c\nKeep whipping my bro\ninto shape! He needs it!
You sure are an amazing\nPokémon Trainer, miss.\c\nI hope you’ll help my\ngeeky bro learn a bit!
How did the world look after\ndefeating the Champion?\c\nI really want to understand it.\nThe way the world looks to a\r\nreal Pokémon Champion...\c\nI’m trying to invent a machine\nthat will let me see it for myself.
That brother of mine... You know,\npeople say that if he’d forget the\c\ninventions and train a bit more,\nhe’d be even stronger than he is.\c\nBut they’re wrong. The discoveries\nhe’s made with his Pokémon are\r\nexactly what make him so strong.

The Pokémon Gym here in Lumiose City\nis just full up of Electric-type Trainers!\r\nYou can just feel the buzz, am I right?\c\nIt’s also known as a quiz Gym.\c\nYou’re looking a mite quizzical, friend.\nYou want to know why it’s called that?\c\nHaha! You’ll find the answers inside!
For beating the Gym Leader the way you did,\nwe’ve gone ahead and carved your name\r\ninto those mysterious-lookin’ statues!
Oh, you and\n[VAR PKNAME(0000)] are...
Oh, you and\n[VAR PKNAME(0000)] are...
Sort of friends, perhaps?\nAm I right?
Becoming good friends!\nI can tell!
Pretty good friends!\nCan I pet it?
Really good friends!\c\nI want to play with it!
Really, really good friends!\c\nI want to give it Poké Puffs and play with it!
Please cherish your friendship\nforever and ever!
Really, really good friends!\c\nI can tell you’ve poured your love into it so much!\nHow wonderful!
The shining Prism Tower is like a lighthouse\nfor people’s minds... It may look like\r\na waste of energy, but it’s important.
Electric-type Pokémon don’t\nhave many weaknesses.

Get this! I saw some giant walking around!\nHe must have been over nine feet tall!\c\nI heard a tale about him, too! They say he’s\nbeen wandering around for 3,000 years in\r\nsearch of a certain Pokémon!
Maybe it’s because of the way they sway about, but\nlittle Espurr here is always clawing at my sleeves!
Myaow myaow!
Anyone who’s cool enough to be able to\ngo to Route 15 can pass right on through!
Do you know about Route 15?\c\nNumerically, it’s right in between Route 14\nand Route 16...

Greetings, [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0403)]sirmiss. This is the gate to Route 14.
Cafés sure are strange places, don’t you think?\c\nThe people sitting in the café watch the people\nwho walk past, and the people who walk past\r\nwatch the people who are sitting in the café.
The power outage has messed up\nsomething in the gate.\c\nClemont is probably busy over at the Gym,\nso it’s up to me to figure out how to fix it.
To make Lumiose City even more beautiful,\nall of the power lines have been laid underground.

I just got word that the power is back on.
It just doesn’t feel like Lumiose City\nwhen the tower isn’t lit up.

Right through this gate is Route 5,\nalso known as Versant Road.\c\nIt leads to both Parfum Palace and\nCamphrier Town.
Sometimes it’s nice to take the long way!\nYou never know what you’ll find.
If you lose your way in Lumiose City, I recommend\nentering a nearby shop to get your bearings.
Hey!
Nice to meet you, friend!\c\nThey call me Mr. Bonding.\nHave you heard about O-Powers?
That expression of yours tells me you haven’t!\nDon’t worry--I’ll tell you all about it.\c\nO-Powers are mysterious forces that have all kinds\nof useful effects. They can make your Pokémon\r\nstronger or even help you get more money!\c\nAny friends you have nearby will also benefit\nfrom them. They truly are mysterious powers!
Let’s get started, shall we?\nIt’s bonding time!
You received an O-Power\nfrom Mr. Bonding.
You can now use Attack Power and\nDefense Power!
Attack Power increases the Attack stat.
And Defense Power increases the\nDefense stat!
That’s not all--the powers can gain levels\nthe more you use them!
Take a look at the instructions if you want\nto know more.\c\nRemember--you can activate an O-Power\nusing the PSS.\c\nWell then, I do believe I shall take my leave\nright about now. Hope to see you around!

So, how are you and [VAR PKNAME(0000)]\ngetting along?\c\nThe more you walk around with your Pokémon,\nthe stronger your friendship will become.

Right through this gate, and you’ll be\nin Lumiose City! Go on already!

Oho! A new face in town! Yes, indeed!\nTake this with you on your way.
Oh, and take this as well.
Yes, they are for Pokémon battles!\c\nBy knowing which items to use\nduring the right moment in battle,\r\na Trainer can save his or her partner in a pinch!
Type matchups, huh?\c\nSo, Water is good for Fire, and Fire works well\nagainst Grass...\r\nAnd Grass is strong against Water--right!
You’ve got your Pokémon holding items\nlike you know what’s going on, right?
Moves have types, too, you know?\c\nIf your Pokémon uses a move that’s the same type\nas the Pokémon, that move’s power will go up!
Even if you catch a wild Pokémon, your team’s\nPokémon will still grow.\c\nI know it because one of my Pokémon leveled up\nwhen it was fighting a battle like that!
The whiteboard explains Pokémon status\nchanges that can occur in battle.
What do you want to read about?
If a Pokémon is poisoned, it will steadily lose HP\nwhen battling.\c\nThe poison won’t disappear after the battle either.\nTo cure it, you will need to use an Antidote.
Paralysis reduces the Speed stat of a Pokémon\nand may prevent it from making any moves.\c\nParalysis also lingers after battle, so use a\nParalyze Heal to free your Pokémon from it.
If a Pokémon falls asleep, it will be unable to\nattack as long as it is sleeping.\c\nThe Pokémon may wake up on its own, but if the\nbattle ends while it is sleeping, it will stay asleep.\c\nYou can wake it up using an Awakening.
A burn reduces a Pokémon’s Attack stat and\nsteadily reduces its HP. It will remain after battle.\c\nYou can cure a burn using a Burn Heal.
If a Pokémon is frozen, it becomes completely\nhelpless--it won’t be able to do a thing.\c\nThe Pokémon may thaw out on its own, but if the\nbattle ends while it is frozen, it will stay frozen.\c\nThaw it out using an Ice Heal.

If we trade Pokémon, you and I will become\nacquaintances!\c\nSo how about it? Why don’t you trade a\n[VAR PKNAME(0002)] for my [VAR PKNAME(0001)]?
Beautiful! Then let’s trade our precious\nPokémon to one another!
So this is your [VAR PKNAME(0002)]...\nI will take great care of it!
That one, huh? But what I’m really looking for is\na [VAR PKNAME(0002)]!
Well, that’s a shame... If you ever change your\nmind, I hope you’ll come find me!
Pokémon and their Trainers are so connected,\nit’s like two hearts beating as one!\c\nWhen you think of it that way, trading one away\nis really quite a momentous thing to do!
Hmm? Sorry, my friend, but we can’t\ntrade if you only have one Pokémon!
Pokémon that you get from trades tend to\ngrow easily, and they quickly get stronger.\c\nBut you know, if you don’t have enough Gym\nBadges, they might not listen to your orders!
You there! Were you just thinking, “Boy, there’s\nnothing to buy at the shops around here!”?\c\nThen get yourself some Gym Badges! The more you\nhave, the more different things you can buy!

There are so many great Gym Badges to be earned\nhere in the Kalos region!\r\nDo you want to hear about them?
Well, you’re the boss.\nBut if you want to know, just come see me again.
If you have a Bug Badge, then Pokémon\nup to Lv. 30 will obey you without question.
If you have a Cliff Badge, then Pokémon\nup to Lv. 40 will obey you without question.
If you have a Rumble Badge, then Pokémon\nup to Lv. 50 will obey you without question.
If you have a Plant Badge, then Pokémon\nup to Lv. 60 will obey you without question.
If you have a Voltage Badge, then Pokémon\nup to Lv. 70 will obey you without question.
If you have a Fairy Badge, then Pokémon\nup to Lv. 80 will obey you without question.
If you have a Psychic Badge, then Pokémon\nup to Lv. 90 will obey you without question.
If you have an Iceberg Badge, then all Pokémon\nwill obey you without question.
Which Badge would you like to hear about?

When a Pokémon is evolving and you\ndon’t want it to, try pressing the B Button!\c\nIt surprises the Pokémon and makes it\nstop evolving.\c\nThat’s Evolution cancellation!

With that Bug Badge, Pokémon up to Lv. 30 will\nlisten to your orders in battle...\r\nYup, even if you get them from trades!\c\nAnd here! This TM commemorates your win against\na pro photog like me.
Using a TM like that one there lets you teach your\nPokémon some new moves quicker than a shutter\r\nset to 1/1000 can snap shut!\c\nTMs are some of the best gear around. They’re\npoint-and-click easy, and you can use them\r\nover and over again!\c\nNow, the TM that I just gave you is for a move\ncalled Infestation. Use it, and it’ll be impossible\r\nfor your opponent to flee from battle!
Now then, can you zoom in a bit to check out\nthe tent behind me?\c\nTake the stairs that you find beyond it, and you’ll\nbe back up to the entrance faster than a flash!
There are some things that you can only see\nwhen looking through a camera’s viewfinder.\c\nAnd there are things you’ll only be able to\nsee clearly by living together with Pokémon.\c\nAnd if, along the way, you find that the things\nmost important to you come into focus...\r\nWell, that’d be fantastic!

O-Powers! They’re mysterious forces!\nIf you use them, good things will happen.\c\nFor example, Pokémon will get stronger\nor you will get more prize money.\c\nSome O-Powers allow you to share\ngood things with friends around you.\c\nThey’re wondrous things that nurture bonds!

Prize Money Power increases prize money\nfrom battle.
Speed Power increases the Speed stat.
Critical Power increases the critical-hit ratio.
Befriending Power makes Pokémon grow\nfriendly more easily.
Encounter Power increases the chance of\nencountering wild Pokémon.
Accuracy Power increases the accuracy.
You can buy items cheaply\nat Poké Marts with Bargain Power.
Exp. Point Power increases the Exp. Points\nfrom a battle.
Stealth Power decreases the chance of\nencountering wild Pokémon.
PP Restoring Power restores the PP\nof the lead Pokémon when you use it.
You can use O-Powers from the PSS, and\nthe more you use them, the higher they level up!\c\nSo use them as often as possible!
